<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF FIJI 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji 
<br/>(CAAF), is the national agency for aviation safety and security oversight of Fiji’s aviation industry.  
<br/>Their  mandate  is  to  regulate,  certify  and  licence  airline,  airport  operators,  traffic  navigation  and 
<br/>security service providers, pilots, aircraft engineers, air traffic controllers, technicians and air cargo 
<br/>operators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In 2020, the work commenced on the review of their primary legislation, pertaining to the 
<br/></span><span>work of civil aviation.  This was the Civil Aviation Act 1976, the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>Act 1979 and the Civil Aviation Reform Act 1999.  The objective of the review was to amalgamate 
<br/>into one document all of the civil aviation primary legislations, except for the security aspects of civil 
<br/>aviation.    This  was  to  ensure  that  all  International  Civil  Aviation  Organisations  (ICAO)  protocol 
<br/>questions relating to primary legislations were adequately addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, CAAF has responded to the Committee’s recommendation.  The responses
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Recommendation 4.1:  Establishment of the management of the database.  According to 
<br/>CAAF,  it  is  of  high  priority  and  the  coordination  has  been  underway  since  2022,  with 
<br/>neighbouring civil aviation authorities to ensure that CAAF is able to leverage the best 
<br/>suited system for our operations.  With the recently appointed CAAF Board, approval to 
<br/>move this project forward is planned to be presented at their second Board meeting this 
<br/>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Recommendation 4.2: The Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) was completed by the maximise 
<br/>at the end of 2022.  The final report was to be submitted to the CAAF Board in its first 
<br/>meeting of this year.  It is envisaged that the direction will be provided by the Board at this 
<br/>meeting for further implementation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Recommendation 4.3:  CAAF  as part of its  safety awareness,  publishes information on 
<br/>mandatory  occurrence  reports  on  the  CAAF  website  in  its  quarterly  aviation  safety 
<br/>bulletins.  In addition, awareness on this is provided during industry awareness meetings 
<br/>audits and inspections.    CAAF will  continue to  advocate  for  a robust  and  non-punitive 
<br/>reporting culture to ensure reports are forthcoming on any issues in the aviation system and 
<br/>any issues in the aviation system is adequately identified and promptly addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would also like to congratulate the first female CEO 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recently appointed, Ms. Theresa Maria O’Boyle Levestam.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  The  floor  is  now  open  for  debate.    The  batting  will  be  led  off  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Viam  Pillay,  then  to  be  followed  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Viliame 
<br/>Gavoka and rounded off by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Manoa Kamikamica. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the  Committee  Report  before 
<br/>Parliament.  The Committee Report on the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji’s 2020 Annual Report 
<br/>contains a few findings that the Committee have also made as its recommendations to Civil Aviation 
<br/>Authority of Fiji (CAAF).  This includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>establishing  a  management  database  as  part  of  its  strategic  aim  to  digitise  its  modus 
<br/>operandi to enhance its service delivery; 
<br/>completing its job evaluation exercise and accordingly remunerate its staff to enable greater 
<br/></span><span>staff retention; 
<br/></span><span>continuing  to  educate  and  undertake  awareness  of  mandatory  occurrence,  reporting 
<br/>amongst aviation operators and ensure the implementation of robust reporting culture and 
<br/>corresponding practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those recommendations by the Committee aim to improve the Authority’s operations and enhance 
<br/>its service delivery to the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report also stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact 
<br/></span><span>on Fiji Airports, Fiji Airways and the entire aviation industry. The closure of borders and the travel 
<br/></span><span>restrictions  implemented  had  a  flow-on  effect  on  the  Authority  as  some  small  private  aerodrome 
<br/>operators  established  to  service  private  resorts  temporary  closed  their  operations  which  impacted 
<br/>revenue received by the Authority in aerodrome certification fees.  To provide relief, the Government 
<br/>allocated a $2.5 million grant to CAAF for the 2020-2021 year to make up for the shortfall and enable 
<br/></span><span>the continuous discharge of the Authority’s function as required by the Civil Authority of Fiji Act 
<br/></span><span>1979. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  CAAF  provided  waivers  for  certain  fees  and  charges  to  aviation  operators 
<br/>including  Fiji  Airports  and  Fiji  Airways  to  assist  them  through  these  unprecedented  times.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, CAAF also undertook the job evaluation exercise which is the process to evaluate the 
<br/>roles and the responsibilities of each staff and determine their relative worth within the organisation. 
<br/>This exercise is important because it helps to ensure that staff are appropriately compensated for their 
<br/>work and that the Authority can now track and retain talented employees.  By completing the job 
<br/>evaluation exercise, CAAF will be better equipped to remunerate its staff accordingly and enable 
<br/>greater staff retention as recommended by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to 
<br/>contribute to the Report on the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2020 Annual Report.  I would like 
<br/>also to acknowledge the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for its deliberations.  If you will allow 
<br/>me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just quite pleased with the last Report that was presented by the Chairman 
<br/>of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, a Chairman that goes to the Opposition Party. It is 
<br/>quite a change in the way we do things in this country now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because for eight years, 
<br/>nothing like that ever came our way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Oh! Correction, correction!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Talk about CAAF.  It is history now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- In 2014, the Chairman for the Public Accounts Committee was given 
<br/>to honourable Prof. Biman Prasad but very soon after that they fired him, they got rid of him.  So, 
<br/>this is a new Fiji, a democracy and Parliament democracy at its best. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I know you are welcome to more going down the line, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  indicated  by  my  colleague  honourable  Bainivalu,  I  also  wish  to 
<br/>congratulate  Mrs.  Theresa  Levestam  as  a  newly  appointed  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Authority of Fiji.  She was Fiji’s first licensed female Air Traffic Controller, the  CAAF 
<br/>Executive and now the first Chief Executive of CAAF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  CAAF  is  an  independent  statutory  authority 
<br/>established  under  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  Act  1979.    In  actual  fact  that  Act  is  quite 
<br/>outdated and we are looking at revising it in keeping with the requirements of International Civil 
<br/>Aviation Organization (ICAO).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, CAAF is responsible for ensuring the safety and security regulations of Civil Aviation 
<br/></span><span>Authority in Fiji and the operation of Fiji registered aircraft outside of our territory.  For Fiji, the 
<br/></span><span>aviation  sector  plays  an  integral  role  in  Fiji’s  economy  and  so  do  the  stakeholders  including  our 
<br/>airline, airports and CAAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prior to this Government, Mr. Speaker, CAAF was under the Solicitor-General, about five 
<br/>staff,  an  important  sector  like  this  was  kind  of  shelved  away  under  the  Solicitor-General.    The 
<br/>Coalition Government decided to form a standalone Ministry, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1681 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aviation and it brought everyone together into the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Just to accommodate you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- For Fiji, the aviation sector plays an integral role in Fiji’s economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and so do the key stakeholders including our airline, airports and CAAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the year under review 2020, CAAF was significantly impacted by the pandemic and its 
<br/>border closure, and this was also the case for Fiji Airports and Fiji Airways.  As noted in the Standing 
<br/>Committee Report, with the significant decline in international air travel, the Authority’s share of the 
<br/>Airport  Departure  Tax  which  accounted  for  approximately  61  percent  of  the  annual  revenue 
<br/>diminished. This is significant with a strong recovery of travel and gradual increase in departure tax, 
<br/>CAAF will continue to serve as mandated efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of the House, departure tax is divided into 75 percent for general treasury, 
<br/>10 percent for Fiji Airports Limited, 5 percent for CAAF and 10 percent for Environmental Levy.  
<br/>That is how we divide the departure tax.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the management priorities of CAAF in 2020 was to recruit a Chief Executvie Officer 
<br/>which has now been done.  We also have a new board under the very able leadership of Mr. Eliki 
<br/>Kaumaitotoya.  He was an engineer, trained by Qantas and also one of the leading players in the 
<br/>setup of Air Terminal Services (ATS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s  effective  implement  in  ratings  determined  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Organization on aviation safety and security oversight systems have ranked us above the global and 
<br/>regional average.  Sir, ICAO carries out this rating on a very regular basis and we cannot be under 
<br/>the average or below what is required internationally, Mr. Speaker.  To this stage we are doing very 
<br/>well, Sir.  This has resulted in the ICAO Council President Certificate being awarded to Fiji during 
<br/>the 41</span><span>st</span><span> ICAO Assembly in Montreal, Canada in 2022. This award is a recognition of the efforts of 
<br/>CAAF staff (past and present) as well as the Fiji Aviation Industry in effectively implementing ICAO 
<br/>standards and recommended practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When international borders as such, CAAF worked with industry partners to ensure essential 
<br/>air transportations such as repatriation and cargo flights continued.  For a sector as heavily regulated 
<br/>as aviation, their role was absolutely critical, and in doing so, CAAF continued to meet international 
<br/>civil aviation requirements in new COVID-19 protocols.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Fiji opened its international borders, CAAF’s role was even more critical in ensuring that 
<br/>our aviation industry was ready for a safe restart and recovery of international civil aviation.  Sir, 
<br/>ICAO COVID-19 initiatives such as the aerodrome restart and public health corridor implementation 
<br/>packages were engaged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite CAAF’s limited human resources, it continued to maintain a healthy level of safety 
<br/>and security oversight all throughout the COVID and post-COVID periods.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>will continue to ensure Fiji is not only compliant with ICAO but we leverage the expertise in the 
<br/></span><span>Pacific. We help our Pacific neighbours a lot in aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following a call for bids in 2022 from ICAO member states to host the ICAO Pacific Small 
<br/>Island Developing States Liaison Officer (PLO), Fiji has been chosen as the host of this prestigious 
<br/>office. The host state agreement was signed in Seoul Korea during the global implementations in 
<br/>June this year which I attended.

<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PLO is expected to take up office here in Fiji from November 2023. No more do we have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to go to Bangkok for ICAO matters. It is going to be based right here in Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  want  to  point  out  that  the  organisation  has  a  good  gender  balance  with  a  female 
<br/>workforce of 42 percent.  For a traditionally male dominated industry, this is a great achievement.  
<br/>Achievements  do  not  come  without  their  challenges,  CAAF  over  the  years  has  faced  the  biggest 
<br/>challenge in recruitments and retention of technical expertise.  We are losing our people…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Why?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  They  are    poached  by  people  from  around  the  Pacific  and  even 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outside of the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Because of Government’s inconsistencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-    It  is  not  unique  to  Fiji,  it  is  all  over  the  world.    Indeed,  in  the 
<br/>conference  that  I  attended  in  Korea,  one  of  the  thematic  areas  was  the  training  of  the  national 
<br/>government to be part of the training programmes to train aviation experts and they are doing that in 
<br/>Fiji now with FNU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are several vacancies that remain unfilled despite numerous efforts to recruit.  This was 
<br/>also  highlighted  in  the  annual  report.    I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  for  providing 
<br/>CAAF… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Former Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- …with its full needs for resources to enable you to hire people that 
<br/>we need.  The staff job evaluation exercise that was underway in 2022 has since been completed and 
<br/>implemented.  We also look at other strategies to recruit and retain critical skills, some of which we 
<br/>are addressing through CAAF to increase its budget allocation for 2023-2024 financial year to $5 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  modernise  our  laws  to  reflect  a  modern  sector.    The  review  of 
<br/>primary  aviation  legislation  is  long  overdue,  and  this  is  a  project  that  CAAF  hopes  to  see  to 
<br/>completion by the end of this year.  This will be followed by a review of the secondary legislation, 
<br/>the Air Navigation Regulation 1981 in line with international best practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As aviation continues to evolve, CAAF will ensure it remains ahead.  It is now more important 
<br/>than ever that CAAF accelerates its plans for digitisation.  Work has commenced with the upgrade 
<br/>of ICT systems.  Fiji’s safety programme first published in 2012 is being reviewed to develop Fiji’s 
<br/>National Aviation Safety Plan in line with the Revised State Safety Programme.  This programme 
<br/>will ensure that Fiji’s Civil Aviation system is able to evolve and remain relevant and sustainable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  obligation  as  a  signatory  to  the  Chicago  Convention  is  vested  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>CAAF as such, CAAF will continue to provide a strong, safety and security oversight system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  There  has  been  a  slight  change  in  the  listing  that  we  have  here,  so 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal will now speak before it is being rounded off by the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister Kamikamica. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak on the report first and then later I will counter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the comments by the honourable Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister number two.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1683 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you again to express my support for the Report of the Standing 
<br/>Committee  on Social  Affairs  on  the  Review  of  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  2020  Annual 
<br/>Report.  This comprehensive report underscores the vital role that the Civil Aviation Authority of 
<br/>Fiji  named  CAAF  plays  in  the  aviation  industry  and  its  commendable  effort  in  navigating  the 
<br/>unprecedented challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aviation industry, a cornerstone of global connectivity and economic 
<br/>growth  faced  an  unparallel  crisis  in  the  year  2020.    The  impact  of  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the 
<br/>international  passenger  traffic  was  staggering  causing  a  significant  drop  in  aircraft  movement.  
<br/>Despite  these  challenges,  CAAF  demonstrated  a  remarkable  resilience  and  resourcefulness  in 
<br/>sustaining its operations, thanks in part to a Government grant of $2.5 million.  This financial support 
<br/>ensured  that  the  Authority  could  continue  its  essential  functions  even  in  the  face  of  international 
<br/>travel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the pivotal points raised in the Report is CAAF’s initiative to establish a management 
<br/>database.    This  ambitious  project  aims  to  streamline  operations  and  hence,  service  delivery  and 
<br/>automate critical processes, the pandemic induced revenue constraints, delayed its implementation, 
<br/>but the intent behind this endeavour is commendable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This database is designed to integrate various standalone databases will undoubtedly facilitate 
<br/>seamless  information  flow  and  contribute  to  more  efficient  decision  making.    Furthermore,  the 
<br/>inclusion of an e-examination and e-licensing system exemplifies CAAF’s commitment to embracing 
<br/>technological achievements for the betterment of the aviation industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report also addresses the matter of few waivers granted to Fiji Airways 
<br/>and Airports Fiji Limited due to the pandemic’s adverse impact and with that, I must congratulate 
<br/>Fiji Airways for getting the new A350s which was an achievement of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this measured approach highlights the Authority’s sensitivity to the needs 
<br/>of the broader aviation  community and its willingness  to  provide relief during challenging  times.  
<br/>The meticulous explanation of the legal basis for such waivers under the Civil Aviation Authority of 
<br/>Fiji  Act  1979  showcases  the  Authority’s  adherence  to  establish  regulations  and  its  transparent 
<br/>decision-making processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  acknowledges  CAAF’s  prudent  response  to  the 
<br/>decline in international air travel and its subsequent impact on revenue.  The Authority’s decision to 
<br/></span><span>operate  in  a  mode  at  its  judicious  utilisation  of  a  Government  grant  to  mitigate  losses  is  both 
<br/></span><span>commendable and responsible.  This approach not only reflects fiscal prudence but also embodies 
<br/>the  spirit  of  solidarity  as  it  safeguards  the  interest  of  the  aviation  industry,  the  workers  and  by 
<br/>extension to Fiji’s broader economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  applaud  the  Standing  Committee  for  Social  Affairs  for  its  insightful 
<br/>Review of the Civil Aviation Authority Report 2020.  The recommendations put forth in the Report 
<br/>are  substantive  and  forward  looking  from  advocating  in  completion  of  the  management  database 
<br/>system  to  emphasising the significance of staff retention  and fostering a  robust reporting  culture.  
<br/></span><span>These  recommendations  underscore  the  Authority’s  commitment  to  continuous  improvement  and 
<br/></span><span>growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aviation sector is not just about aeroplanes and runways.  
<br/>It  is  about  connecting  people,  fostering  economic  prosperity  and  promoting  national  pride.    The 
<br/>CAAF’s  dedication  to  upholding  these  values  even  in  the  face  of  unprecedented  challenge  is  a 
<br/>testament and its resilience vision and commitment to Fiji’s future.

<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I implore my colleagues to support the motion at hand and before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, as I was commenting on some of the comments made by the honourable Minister himself.  This 
<br/>Report is  for 2020 when the Civil  Aviation Authority was just a department,  but  currently it is  a 
<br/>ministry on its own.  So, these achievements are under the achievements of the former Minister and 
<br/>former Attorney-General, Mr. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum.  At the same time, I must also congratulate the 
<br/>new  CEO  as  highlighted  by  them,  who  is  also  a  woman,  but  I  must  also  say  that  our  Local 
<br/>Government CEO’s appointed from the women community, and at the same time, I ask Parliament 
<br/>to support the Report before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just to remind you that I also once served in that ministerial position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know we have been sitting late, so I will 
<br/>endeavour to be short and swift.  Firstly, on behalf of the 55 Members of Parliament, I would just 
<br/>like  to  on  behalf  of  all  of  us  again  congratulate  the  Fiji  Water  Flying  Fijians  for  a  wonderful 
<br/>performance today.  If there is any doubt in the world where Fiji Rugby is today, it is headed for tier 
<br/>one status and I would like to make a prediction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Cup, the Web Ellis 
<br/>trophy will be in Fiji very soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, allow me to just talk about two other issues before  I 
<br/>delve into the Report.  I sympathise with our colleagues about their pre-occupation with our decision 
<br/>to use Standing Order 51.  I thought I would be just very clear and assure them that we are not doing 
<br/>it because we disregard the process, it is simply because we need to move fast.  We are trying to fix 
<br/>the messes of 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Talk to the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So to our  colleagues on the other side and to the public of 
<br/>Fiji, bear with us.  Very soon, we will revert to due process, but right now, there is a lot of mess to 
<br/>fix up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  third  point  I  would  like  to  make  very  quickly  is  I  know  that  the 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal talked about the achievements of Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji but being a 
<br/>practitioner from Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, there used to be something bothered me greatly 
<br/>when I was looking at aviation management from a far.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One was mentioned by the honourable colleague of mine honourable Gavoka that the Civil 
<br/>Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji  is  the  most  important  entity  in  our  economy.    It  manages  the  largest 
<br/>industry in  Fiji  but was  shoved aside into a Department  under the Solicitor-General’s Office  and 
<br/>under resourced.  As they say in Ra “</span><span>e wara me so’a</span><span>”  - there was a lot of incongruence between the 
<br/>loud voices and what we could see as a practitioner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  thing  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  so  glad,  and  I  would  like  to  congratulate  my 
<br/>honourable  colleague  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  finally  confirming  Theresa  Maria  O’Boyle 
<br/></span><span>Levestam into the position of the CEO of Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before this appointment Mr. Speaker, Sir, she was acting for three years and prior to that, the 
<br/>gentleman in this report they say that it was tabled by another acting CEO of Civil Aviation Authority 
<br/>of Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst we are thankful for the report, I am so relieved that someone who 
<br/>knows about Civil Aviation, is actually in charge of Civil Aviation and starting to clean up the mess 
<br/>that is actually there.

<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1685 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, in talking to the motion at hand Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs for their wonderful report. They made some very good points 
<br/>around three recommendations Sir, which I support - the importance of a database is fundamental in 
<br/>any management, and I am very happy that it was actually being recommended.  In terms of the Job 
<br/>Evaluation Exercise, just to educate the guys on the other side when honourable Gavoka talked about 
<br/>loss of skills, they asked why? If you are not aware…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You do not know! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I think they do not know. If you are not aware, the people 
<br/>that enter Civil Aviation are some of the most skilful people in this country, in the area of aviation - 
<br/>they are in high demand, and not only marketable in our country but globally as well, so that is why 
<br/>you will see high turnover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite important, and I am glad that the Job Evaluation Report has been done, because 
<br/>what it will do is perhaps reward the existing officers in CAAF properly and allow to slow down 
<br/>what has been the normal occurrence in terms of turn over. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  note  that  the  CAAF’s  continues  commitment  to  Mandatory 
<br/>Occurrence Reporting. Again, for those of you who are not aware of what this is, this is one of the 
<br/>most important reports in aviation Mandatory Occurrence Reporting - it actually allows you to assess 
<br/>critical  issues,  risk  issues  before  they  actually  blow  up  in  your  face.  So,  I  am  so  glad  that  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Authority of Fiji is taking it very seriously and I was not aware they now publish it.  I would 
<br/>like to congratulate them because it builds a very safe and very solid authority which we need for our 
<br/>largest industry in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  those  few  words  I  would  like  to  support  the  report  and  thank  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for their contributions with this report. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  given  that  I  have  spoken  on  the 
<br/>recommendations of the Committee and the responses to the recommendations by the Civil Aviation 
<br/>Authority  of  Fiji,  we  have  also  heard  the  thoughts  from  honourable  Members  that  have  been 
<br/>exchanged across the floor, so with that Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of our sitting today. I thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you all for your contributions.  Parliament is now adjourned until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 8.51 p.m.
