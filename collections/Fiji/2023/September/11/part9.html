<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Taito  Rokomatu  Matasawalevu  subscribed  to  the  Administration  of 
<br/>Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance and took his seat in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Congratulations, honourable Member, and welcome to Parliament.  I wish 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you all the best in this term of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now invite the honourable Taito Rokomatu Matasawalevu to deliver 
<br/>his Maiden Speech and I remind all honourable Members about the established protocols for Maiden 
<br/>Speeches and to show courtesy this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. T.R. Matasawalevu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.R.  MATASAWALEVU.-  </span><span>Au  saka.  </span><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  begin  by 
<br/>acknowledging God the highest for the gifts and many blessings that he has showered over my life, 
<br/>my family and my beloved nation over the years. Without God’s grace and favour, I would not have 
<br/>been able to fulfil His calling to provide service to this august Parliament and this nation and for that, 
<br/>I owe him all the glory and honour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; if I may speak in the iTaukei language, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka saka na 
<br/></span><span>vei Turaga Bale kei na vei Marama Bale ni nodatou yasana e tinikava, namaste, assalamu alaikum 
<br/>and fai’aksia. </span><span> A warm greeting to you all from me, my family and the people of Wainibuka (one 
<br/>bus, one people and one river). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the first time for me to stand in front of all of you but not new to the fact that I am here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to serve the people, as I had done in my community workdays back in my early careers.  It is my

<div><span>Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1597 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>passion that led me to stand in the Election to represent the people on another level.  I am not here to 
<br/>only serve those who had voted me, I am here to serve the people of our nation and to you on your 
<br/>nomination to the esteemed role of Speaker of this august Parliament on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022, and 
<br/>to the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the future is uncertain and full of challenges and opportunities, the 
<br/>key learning on what we have been going through from the past can help to direct us safely into the 
<br/>future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am humbled to be given this noble privilege and wish to thank all Fijians 
<br/>who put their trust in me and voted me in as part of the FijiFirst Party under the leadership of the 
<br/>former  Prime  Minister,  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama.    I  stand  here  proudly  on  behalf  of  all  our 
<br/>committed and loyal voters and supporters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also would like to extend my acknowledgement to the former Attorney-General and Minister 
<br/>for Economy, Mr. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum; the honourable Leader of the Opposition and my </span><span>kabani</span><span>; 
<br/>the  honourable  Opposition  Members  of  Parliament;  Party  candidates  who  had  fought  the  2022 
<br/>General Election together; Team Central – Mrs. Sala Rabuku Vuibau, Mr. Sailasa Rokotuinidau, my 
<br/>brother and cousins (Mr. Sakeo Seru, Mr. Samisoni Nitayaqa and Mr. Sairusi Natuna); our FijiFirst 
<br/>Office (Mrs. Ela Sayed-Khaiyum, Ms. Una Moceisuva, Mr. Ben Qionibaravi, Ms. Taina Lewa and 
<br/>Ms.  Deborah)  and  not  forgetting  the  Samabula-based  campaigning  team  and  all  our  voters  from 
<br/>Wainibuka and around the country.  To our voters, I reassure you all that FijiFirst is here because of 
<br/>you, as we have in the past eight years, and will continue for years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank my family (Mrs. Rokomatu and my children); Mr. and Mrs. 
<br/>Oli  from  Pacific  Adventist  College  in  Papua  New  Guinea;  my  90  year  old  mother  -  my  biggest 
<br/>supporter, who is always with me from day one till now and not forgetting the </span><span>vanua o Naduadua</span><span>, 
<br/>Naloto and Wainuqa for your support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the FijiFirst Government for the infrastructural development works 
<br/>that was carried out by Energy Fiji Limited, Fiji Roads Authority and Water Authority of Fiji in the 
<br/>past  eight years.  As for my  province of Tailevu and the  </span><span>Tikina</span><span> </span><span>o Wainibuka</span><span> which begins  from 
<br/>Korovou  heading  down  towards  the  border  of  Ra,  travelling  is  so  much  easier  and  access  to 
<br/>electricity, water and good roads is a joy to watch. For a very long time, we eat dust, we travel in the 
<br/>dust and even our house is covered in dust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  leadership  of  FijiFirst,  changes  happened  and  we,  from 
<br/></span><span>Wainibuka, benefitted from this change.  It is my privilege to highlight in this august Parliament and 
<br/>members of the public what the FijiFirst Government has done for Wainibuka that brought about 
<br/>these  changes.    These  development  works  are  in  the  form  of  streetlights,  footpaths,  bridges  and 
<br/>structures and lastly, tarsealled road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you happen to travel down from Korovou to Dama, there are a total of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>eight bridges along the way, at: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Balekinaga Village; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Dama Village; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Naqia Village; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Nayavu Village; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Naveicovatu Village; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Waito; 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Wailotua Village; and

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Waimaro.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All those bridges were wooden and now they are so solid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every village has streetlights and footpaths from Dama to Korovou.  There 
<br/>is access to farm roads for most of us farmers.  These development works of bridges and wharfs, 
<br/>electrification  and  water  does  not  only  run  along  Korovou  to  Dama,  but  it  also  extends  through 
<br/>Korovou to Dawasamu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost every cyclone passes through Wainibuka, including flooding.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government does not turn a blind eye, instead it assisted everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does not end there, during COVID-19, Fiji was the fifth country in the 
<br/>world to recover and yet, we still find a way to control VAT and assist the grassroot citizens of Fiji.  
<br/>Most houses in Wainibuka were rebuilt after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and yet, the economy is still stable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Nayavu  Health  Centre  has  an  area  coverage  till  Vatukarasa  and  Tonia 
<br/>Nursing Stations.  The role of public health facilities and personnel is to prevent illness throughout 
<br/>the lifespan.  It sad to note that this is not the case, and I will highlight to this august Parliament the 
<br/>needs based on people’s expectations:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transport for Nayavu Health Centre is always used in Korovou.  Looking at the large area 
<br/>of service from Ra down to the Wainibuka area, the need for a vehicle is paramount for 
<br/>medical and nursing staff to attend to mobile clinic and home visits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Facilities and equipment at Nayavu Health Centre do not meet the standard of WASH FIT 
<br/>facility and is not infection regulated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Nayavu  Health  Centre  needs  to  have  its  own  Morgue.    People  from  parts  of  Ra  and 
<br/>Wainibuka travel to Korovou Hospital Morgue to preserve their loved ones before burial.  
<br/>If  Korovou  Hospital  Morgue  is  full,  they  will  have  to  transport  the  bodies  to  Mokani 
<br/>Morgue or Wainibokasi Morgue. This is a very expensive exercise for the people of parts 
<br/>of Ra and Wainibuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Waiting area is not enough to cater for the people who use the Nayavu Health Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On health services, the need for doctors to be stationed at Nayavu Health Centre.  There is 
<br/></span><span>only one doctor and most of the time, the doctor is engaged at Korovou Hospital on night shift.  Upon 
<br/>his return, he sleeps, leaving the public neglected with basic medical services that are only provided 
<br/>by doctors. This was witnessed during the last three years whereby villagers in Wainibuka suffered 
<br/>from Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and typhoid.  As for the current health workers, they are 
<br/>trying  to  stop  leptospirosis  in  three  villages  of  Wainibuka.    As  the  saying  goes  and  I  quote:  “ 
<br/>Prevention is better than cure.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Wainibuka development issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Wainibuka has great potential but lack 
<br/></span><span>the boost from Government assistance to fulfill its targets.  If I may highlight some potential and 
<br/></span><span>much needed development works for Wainibuka and parts of Ra, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Need for banana cooler for </span><span>Tikina Nailega</span><span> and nearby villages from the Ra Province. 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revival of Wainuqa chips at Nabulini. 
<br/>Irish Crossing at Manu Village. 
<br/>EFL grid extension at Soa Village and Matuku Village.

<div><span>Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1599 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Need  for  connectivity  - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>installation  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tower/satellite  dish  at  Nalidi  Village, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Naituvatuvavatu Village, Matuku Village, Nasau Village and Wailotua Village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Need for DISMAC Operation – fiberglass boats and outboard engine (40 horsepower)  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be used during floods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Need business investment in bowser and bakery to cater for people in the Wainibuka area. 
<br/>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Provision  of  government  vehicle  at  the  Nayavu  Government  Station  to  assist  in  its 
<br/>operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Agriculture to be elevated from subsistence to commercial level. 
<br/>10.</span><span> </span><span>More agricultural assistance to elevate farmers. This is to allow farmers to thrive on their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>own; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11.</span><span> </span><span>Need to install EPS unit which will allow 23 villages to drink clean water. The current 23 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>villages are drinking water from rural water scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on agriculture, there is a great need to look into the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Staff versus farmers ratio; 
<br/>Farmers record for </span><span>tikina, koro</span><span>, farm visit and farmers profile; 
<br/>Farmers development needs;  
<br/>Commercialisation of bananas, cocoa, duruka and vanilla to be included in the five-year 
<br/>development plan; 
<br/>Improve livestock service and clinical services to be served from Nayavu, rather than being 
<br/>centralised in Korovou or Nausori for the farmers to access;   
<br/>Zoning of crop location, economic long-term investment, retirement crops and appointment 
<br/>of staff to look after those crops; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Wainibuka  needs  mechanical  and  heavy  machineries  to  cultivate  land  for  agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to speak on Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Service (TSLS).  
<br/>For the past years, youth of Fiji, including people who want to extend their studies were given the 
<br/>opportunity to further their education.  This has given our youth the power to secure jobs, not only 
<br/>locally  but  internationally.    This  is  seen  through  the  high  demand  of  people  with  or  without 
<br/>qualification from Australia and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this waiver of TSLS by the Coalition Government, it just created a gap in the further 
<br/>education level, and it goes against Section 31 in Chapter 2 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic 
<br/>of  Fiji  which  states  that  every  person  has  the  right  to  Early  Childhood  Education,  Primary  and 
<br/></span><span>Secondary Education and Further Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for parents of children who will be graduating at the end of this year, please, 
<br/>be prepared to pay your children’s higher education fees.  Now, you will have to dig into your Fiji 
<br/>National Provident Fund (FNPF) or take loans.  If you are a fisherman or farmer with high hopes of 
<br/>your children furthering their education in university, I have one word of advice, “work hard as times 
<br/>ahead is not going to be easy”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw our attention to a matter of most significance that affects the 
<br/></span><span>very fabric of our nation’s future - the digital divide that exists between our urban communities and 
<br/></span><span>rural and remote communities of Fiji, as we forge ahead into an era of rapid technological and global 
<br/>connectivity.  It is imperative that we address this divide head on, for it has far-reaching implications 
<br/>on the equitable access to quality education and employment opportunities for our youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  youth  are  the  lifeblood  of  our  nation.  They  hold  within  them  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potential to shape our future, drive innovation and lead our nation towards prosperity.  Their  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potential remains untapped when hindered by barriers of unequal access to digital resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In urban centres where  digital infrastructure is  more robust, students  enjoy  the benefits  of 
<br/>online learning, access  to  a world  of information and exposure of new ideas.  Yet,  in  the remote 
<br/>corners  of  our  nation,  many  young  minds  are  deprived  of  these  opportunities,  trapped  by  lack  of 
<br/>connectivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot afford to let geography determine and exacerbate their existing 
<br/>socio-economic inequalities, limiting the chances of those in remote communities to receive quality 
<br/>education  that  prepares  them  for  the  challenges  of  modern  world.    This,  in  turn,  restricts  their 
<br/>prospects of meaningful employment and upward mobility.  It is our duty as representatives of the 
<br/>people to bridge this digital divide and ensure that every Fijian youth, regardless of their location, 
<br/>has an equal shot at success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, bridging the digital divide requires a multi-facet approach.  Firstly, we must 
<br/>invest in robust infrastructure that extends to every corner of the nation.  This includes laying down 
<br/>broadband network, establishing digital learning centres and providing affordable devices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  furthermore,  partnership  between  public  and  private  sectors,  as  well  as 
<br/>collaboration with international organisations can play a role in accelerating our progress towards 
<br/>digital equality.  By harnessing the collective resources and expertise of various stakeholders, we can 
<br/>amplify our impact and ensure a more rapid and comprehensive transformation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  the  digital  divide  between  the  haves  and  have  nots  is  a 
<br/>challenge  that  cannot  be  ignored.  It  is  our  duty  to  create  an  environment  where  all  Fijian  youth, 
<br/>regardless of their background, can access quality education and seek better employment opportunity 
<br/>in  the  digital  age.    By  investing  in  digital  infrastructure,  providing  digital  literacy  education  and 
<br/>fostering collaboration partnership, we can bridge this divide and pave the way for a  brighter and 
<br/>more inclusive future of our youth in our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, as you have all noticed, I have mostly mentioned Wainibuka 
<br/>and  parts  of  Ra  in  the  content  of  my  speech.  I  want  to  assure  the  people  of  Fiji  and  this  august 
<br/>Parliament that these are issues that affect all rural communities, outer islands and villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Government Ministers and honourable Members of this august Parliament, we have been 
<br/>tasked with an important role entrusted to us by our voters and the people of Fiji. I want to remind 
<br/></span><span>us all that we all need to go back to all our voters, listen to their needs and improve their livelihood 
<br/></span><span>and economic well-being. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  those  who  do  not  know  me,  I  am  Taito  Rokomatu  Matasawalevu, 
<br/>originally from Naveicovatu, Naloto in Wainibuka, Tailevu, </span><span>vasu</span><span> Nailega in Wainibuka and I am a 
<br/>proud Seventh-Day Adventist believer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that being said, I thank you for your indulgence and to all my colleagues 
<br/>in this august Parliament, members of the public and those seated here at the public gallery or viewing 
<br/></span><span>this live or maybe watching the delayed coverage of my speech.  Sir, if you may allow me to end my 
<br/></span><span>speech today in the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> language with a famous saying in Wainibuka, “</span><span>Me’u tinia – Ni Amania</span><span>
<br/>one bus, one people, one river”.  </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>.
