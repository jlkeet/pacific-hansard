<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, but 
<br/>that one hour be given to debate on the Bill, with the Right of Reply given to me as the 
<br/>Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Drainage Act 1961 was enacted in 1961 and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provides for the execution of drainage works, among other things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Act  is  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  which  was  established  in  2017  to 
<br/>address to growing threat of flooding in Fijian communities.  In 2018, the Act was amended to allow 
<br/>the Ministry to assume the responsibility for drainage systems and the functions of drainage boards 
<br/>under the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regrettably,  adequate  consultation  and  planning  have  not  been  undertaken  prior  to  the 
<br/>removal of the Drainage Boards.  Consequently, there has been a noticeable decline in the overall 
<br/>production  of  sugarcane,  as  well  as  non-sugar  commodities,  produced  from  the  drainage  scheme 
<br/>areas which attributed to the transfer of the responsibilities of drainage systems to the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is anticipated, therefore, that the establishment of drainage boards will improve the service 
<br/>and maintenance of drainage scheme areas whilst contributing towards the increase in the production 
<br/>of sugar and non-sugar commodities produced in those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Drainage  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  accordingly  seeks  to  amend  the  Act  to  revert  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibility of drainage systems to the drainage boards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is urgent for the Government, given that the Ministry of Waterways 
<br/>have put in plans in this financial year for the Drainage Boards to undertake the responsibility of 
<br/>drainage systems and shift that burden from the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been comprehensive consultations with the Office of the Solicitor-General, the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Local Government, Municipal Councils, the Ministry of Sugar 
<br/></span><span>and the Sugarcane Growers Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the amending legislation will come into force on a date or dates appointed by the Minister by notice 
<br/>in the Gazette.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act by inserting the definitions of “Board” and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“drainage area”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting new sections 3, 4 and 5 to -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide for the declaration of drainage areas, and related matters;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a) 
<br/>(b)  provide for boards  and enable such boards to  appoint officers to  carry out  functions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the Act and to remunerate such officers; and  
<br/>provide for the quorum and proceedings of the meetings of the drainage boards.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1643 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 8 of the Act to replace references made to the “Ministry” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the “Board”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 9 of the Act to replace references made to the “Permanent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secretary” with the “Board”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill amends the Act to include boards in the limitation of liability provision 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is currently only extended to officers of the Ministry and the Permanent Secretary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 7 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting section 11 to establish a drainage fund where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all grants of money made to a board will be paid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clauses  8  and  9  of  the  Bill  amend  sections  20  and  21  of  the  Act,  respectively,  to  replace 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>references made to the “Permanent Secretary” with the “Board”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 10 of the Bill deletes sections 24, 25, 26, 27 and 30 of the Act which provided for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transition of drainage responsibilities from boards to the Ministry in 2018, and are now obsolete 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, once again, we on this side of Parliament really do not see 
<br/>why there is a necessity to do this through Standing Order 51.   At the end of the day, I think for quite 
<br/>a  substantial  amount  of  time,  Government  when  they  were  in  Opposition  and  even  now  says 
<br/>consultation,  consultation,  consultation  is  required  with  respect  to  any  Bills,  et  cetera,  that  come 
<br/>before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister and Attorney-General has actually just said that there was extensive 
<br/>consultation  but  the list  that he just read out  is really just consultation  between inter-government 
<br/>ministries - there is no consultation between the public.  The only people outside (which I recall he 
<br/>said) was the Sugarcane Growers Council but there has been no consultation.  It would seem that this 
<br/>is  merely  just  a  systematic  dismantling  of  what  we  had  done  earlier,  to  put  back  what  was  there 
<br/>before.  With respect to the substantive matter within the actual Bill that has been put forward, the 
<br/>material that is there was being taken care of by the Ministry of Waterways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In any event, Sir, we are very practical about what we do, and you will see that tomorrow.  
<br/>We are very practical about how we approach this.  If you want to use Standing Order 51 we do not 
<br/></span><span>have an objection sometimes when it is absolutely necessary for you to do so.  He has not for one 
<br/></span><span>single moment, in his five minutes of speaking, shown the urgency with which this requires to go 
<br/>through  Standing  Order  51.    This  is  an  important  area  of  our  economy,  Sir,  and  it  does  require 
<br/>consultation.  His entire list was just the Office of the Solicitor-General, etc, etc - all the Government 
<br/>bodies; so we object to it.  We all do on this side of Parliament, and I understand the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition also needs to say some things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to briefly speak on the use and abuse of 
<br/>Standing Order 51.  They are now nine months in Government.  You very well understand that they 
<br/></span><span>used to criticise us badly when we were in government on the use and abuse of Standing Order 51, 
<br/></span><span>but what difference have they brought into this august Parliament when they are in Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I remember correctly, not a single Bill that they have brought into this august Parliament 
<br/>in the last nine months, have come through the proper channel rather than Standing Order 51.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, they all know what they uttered during the campaign.  I say that again - apart from the 
<br/>depth, this is one area they concentrated on - the use and abuse of Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1644 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  difference  have  you  brought  into  Parliament  when  you  are  now  in  Government?  
<br/>Nothing!  You hoodwinked and lied to the people.  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  That is 
<br/>exactly my point.  We will talk about the substantive Bill on Thursday, but it is the use and abuse of 
<br/>Standing Order 51, that we oppose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just sum up everything in one line just as the 
<br/>honourable Koya says.  We have consulted, and I, as the Minister for Sugar, have consulted.  The 
<br/>farmers are crying.  Second line is this - you listen, the consultation was very extensive.  The point 
<br/>is this, you do not want to listen.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we consulted the farmers and the farmers are so 
<br/>unhappy about the drainage system, and this Bill is very appropriate at the right time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a very quick response to the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition.  He is  talking  about  abuse and misuse of Standing  Order 51  and he is 
<br/>saying nothing has changed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This government, over the last so many sittings of Parliament that we have had, they have 
<br/>had more respect they ever imagined that they would give to the Opposition in the last eight years.  
<br/>We were terrorised sitting in the Opposition because all of them, including the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, was sitting there gulping all the abuse and misuse of the Standing Order 51 that we 
<br/>saw over the eight years.  What we are doing with this urgent Bill is that, in the last 15 years, decrees, 
<br/>Standing Order 51, Bills that were brought into Parliament and those before, we are now looking at 
<br/>these very carefully and in a very short period of time we want to change some of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  Drainage  Bill  is  coming  after  the  budget  allocation.  
<br/>Honourable Singh is 100 percent correct.  You look at the drainage system in the country today - the 
<br/>worst ever disaster that we have seen under that FijiFirst Government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- and here, the honourable Leader of the Opposition who was 
<br/>once the Minister for Agriculture, knows that.  This is an urgent Bill.  We want to get down to making 
<br/>sure that there is drainage work done.  We do not want to delay it for the next three or four months 
<br/></span><span>because the budget was  passed in July, 2023, came into effect on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023 and we are in 
<br/></span><span>September.  It makes sense to have this done quickly and move ahead and fix the drains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute on the motion at hand. In 
<br/>the last Parliament, the previous government totally misused Standing Order 51, totally - 100 percent.  
<br/>In 2014 – the total Bills passed under Standing Order 51 was 16; in 2015 it was 30 out of 32; in 2017 
<br/>it was 40 out of 41; 2019 – 29 out of 30 Bills passed under SO 51; in 2020 - 51 Bills passed under 
<br/>SO 51 out of 52, and in 2021 – all 36 Bills passed under SO 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yours is 100 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  I  mean  99  percent  of  the  Bills  they  brought  up  was  under 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1645 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- That is copy and paste. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The data evidence is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- And here they have the audacity to tell us not to use it.  These 
<br/>are urgent issues for the Drainage Bill - do any of you come from Rewa?  If you go there, we have 
<br/>huge issues with the drainage not only the drainage but also dredging.  So, with climate change it is 
<br/>a huge threat and we need to get this through as soon as possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not speak for long but the only point that I 
<br/>want to make is the government has been there for nine months. Name one Bill that you have referred 
<br/>to the Standing Committee?  Just one Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that I am making here is, we never said that we will not use Standing Order 51.  We 
<br/>were using Standing Order 51 because the provision was there but it is the government when they 
<br/>were in Opposition the kept on hammering that Standing Order 51 is not the way forward.  In fact 
<br/>they used that in their campaign but what are they doing today?  They are doing the opposite, they 
<br/>are using Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, in other words they are hoodwinking the public by saying that we 
<br/>will not use Standing Order 51 and that is precisely what they are doing.  We are just pointing that 
<br/>point to you.  That is all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  precisely  the  point.    When  we  were  in 
<br/>government, we never said to stop using  Standing Order 51 but they did.  The honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister said it, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Professor Biman Prasad said it, Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister Gavoka said it, the honourable Tuisawau said it, the honourable Lynda Tabuya said it, the 
<br/>honourable Pio Tikoduadua said it, the honourable Ratu Atonio Lalabalavu said it.  Who else was 
<br/></span><span>here?  The honourable Jese Saukuru said it, and also the honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they said do not use it.  They said it was important not to use it because it 
<br/>denies democracy in getting it to be discussed in this Parliament.  This is the point.  My apologies 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of you said it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, we did not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  I  am  not  going  to  call  you  hypocrites  but  when  someone  says 
<br/></span><span>something  and  does  the  opposite  that  is  hypocrisy.    I  am  not  calling  you  hypocrites  but  that  is 
<br/></span><span>hypocrisy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply.  Speaking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in reply to the motion on Standing Order 51.  Let us hope we are all clear on that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA. - Mr. Speaker, I would re-state what I said earlier - </span><span>ceuta mada mai 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>na malamala mai na matamudou</span><span>,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU. - </span><span>E rau duidui na malamala kei na lasu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, 48 Bills  last  year.  This  Bill initially  came from  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  of  course  you  have  to  give  credit  to  the  Minister  and  his  Assistant 
<br/>Minister because they started off their career there.  They want to put this thing right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Walk the talk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- We are fixing the problem they did. It needs to be done because of 
<br/>the sugar industry.  I can recall in our last Parliament session the Leader of Opposition  - I do not 
<br/>know whether it was in the House or if it was casual conversation, but he had said that there should 
<br/>be a Drainage Board, yet today he says something else.  It is Government policy so that we can have 
<br/>some transparency and clarity into agriculture. That is why we need a Drainage Board to be set up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, we are trying to clear some housekeeping issues 
<br/>because the hour on the clock is after 4.00 p.m.  For the purpose of complying with Standing Orders 
<br/>with respect to sitting time, I now call upon the Leader of Government in Parliament the honourable 
<br/>Lynda Tabuya to move the suspension motion.   
<br/></span></div>
