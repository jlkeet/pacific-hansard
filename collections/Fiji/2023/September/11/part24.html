<div><span>HIGHER SALARIES COMMISSION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 (Bill No. 24/2023), be considered by Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and

<br/>Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the twelfth Bill that was introduced by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coalition Government under Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Higher Salaries Commission was previously established in 1983 under the Higher
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salaries  Commission  Act  to  consider  and  determine  the  salaries  of  Chief  Executive  Officers  of 
<br/>publicly owned corporations and bodies, Government-controlled companies, Permanent Secretaries 
<br/>and the Chief Executive Officers of every city, town and District Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2011,  the  Highest  Salaries  Commission  Act  (Cap  2A),  together  with  its  subsidiary 
<br/>legislation was repealed by the Higher Salaries Act 2011. As a result, the Commission established 
<br/>pursuant to the Higher Salaries Commission Act was abolished.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pursuant  to  the  Higher  Salaries  Act  2011,  the  salaries  which  used  to  be  considered  and 
<br/>determined by the Commission is to be determined, as the case may be, by a Minister, authority or 
<br/>body prescribed under written law which appoints or has authority over any such board, corporation, 
<br/>Government  controlled  company,  authority  or  body,  following  the  approval  of  the  Minister 
<br/>responsible for public enterprises and the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The consensus of Cabinet is that there must be a central coordination mechanism for salaries 
<br/>of top executive positions in boards, corporations, authority or body or any Government controlled 
<br/>company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due to the abolishment of the Commission, the determination of salaries of top executives of 
<br/>prescribed bodies was left to the responsibility of boards and ministers. This has resulted in a lack of 
<br/>coordination or supervision by any central authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is urgent for the Government and must be considered without delay 
<br/>so  that  the  process  for  determination  of  salaries  can  be  streamlined  and  supervised  by  a  central 
<br/>authority. Therefore, the Higher Salaries Commission Bill, 2023 will re-establish the Higher Salaries 
<br/>Commission and guide the determination of salaries of top executive positions of prescribed bodies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations were held with the Ministry of Civil Service, the Ministry of Public Enterprises 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the Office of the Solicitor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Act will come into force on a date or day that is appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill provides for the definitions of terms used throughout the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  3  of  the  Bill  establishes  the  Higher  Salaries  Commission  and  provides  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>composition of the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill provides the criteria used to determine the eligibility for the appointment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of a member of the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill provides how vacancies in the Commission are to be filled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill stipulates the meeting requirements of the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 7 of the Bill outlines the functions of the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 8 of the Bill outlines the powers of the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  9  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  appointment  of  officers  and  employees  including 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>temporary casual officers and employees of the Commission.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I would like to mention that someone 
<br/>actually mentioned from the other side that last year we brought around 49 Bills, which was basically 
<br/>50  percent  of  the  Bills  that  were  brought  into  this  Parliament  under  Standing  Order  51.    But, 
<br/>considering this Bill No. 24, 100 percent of the Bills that had been brought into this Parliament by 
<br/>the current Government are under Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I would like to reiterate the same thing that they were the ones sitting on this side 
<br/>for the past  eight years  and opposing the use of Standing Order 51.  They went  out  to  campaign 
<br/>saying that we have been abusing Standing Order 51, and here they are, 54 Bills in eight months and 
<br/>all under Standing Order 51.  If that was not less, they also reduced the number of sittings for the 
<br/>budget session trying to actually compact everything in one week when initially it was discussed and 
<br/>agreed for two weeks of the budget session.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Bill No. 24 of 2023, so this means all 24 Bills that have been brought by 
<br/>the Government to this particular august Parliament under Standing Order 51 – 100 percent.  We are 
<br/>not against the use of Standing Order 51, we had been using it and this is why we need to be cautious 
<br/></span><span>of what we actually say in Parliament.  The table has turned around and now they are actually sitting 
<br/></span><span>that side, and I do not know how they can go and face the same voters and explain to them why they 
<br/>are using Standing Order 51 to bring in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  This  is  a  new  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  urge  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  to  reconsider  his  stance  and  let  us  send  it  to  the  Committee  to  do  a  public 
<br/>consultation  and bring the report back to  Parliament and we can debate this particular Bill  in the 
<br/></span><span>November sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can remember that one of the senior Members of 
<br/>Government said, ‘his salary is higher than the honourable Prime Minister’s because he is technical 
<br/>in nature’.  That is the very reason we want to set up the High Salaries Commission.  That is urgent.  
<br/>The Government has already made a decision that it is going to set up the High Salaries Commission, 
<br/>funds have been set aside and we need this body to be set up as soon as possible so that they can do

<div><span>the work they are being given.  It is the policy of the Government.  Only 14 Bills that have come to 
<br/>this Parliament under Standing Order 51.   Rest assured, there will be Bills in the future that will go 
<br/>through the normal manner. I endorse the Bill, Sir.
