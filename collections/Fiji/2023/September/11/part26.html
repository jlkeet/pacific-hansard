<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE FIJI POLICE FORCE  
<br/>AUGUST 2018 - JULY 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Fiji Police Force August 2018 to July 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will go straight to the findings of the Committee 
<br/>in this Report.  We had seven findings that we thought that people might want to debate on.  The first 
<br/></span><span>one is that there is a need by the Fiji Police Force for the use of drones.  They think that it may help 
<br/></span><span>them manage the traffic congestion that we currently have on our roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also noted Mr. Speaker, Sir, that despite the Fiji Police Force’s attempts to increase the 
<br/>number of women, that there is still space within the Force for women in senior positions.  We also 
<br/>noted that there is an increase in prevalence of crime against women and children and suicide in Fiji 
<br/>as reflected in the reporting period which certainly will warrant positive intervention measures not 
<br/>only from the Police but from all of us. Earlier on, we were given this nice frangipani as a reminder 
<br/>of our responsibility to children.  I thank the Ministry for Women for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also noted, Sir, that in recent times, a next of kin had not been able to process or procure 
<br/>legal claims or ownership to death and insurance benefits due to the cases of the seven years absence 
<br/>clause where no statute applies.  Therefore, there is merit to recommending perhaps changes to the 
<br/>law where it be amended to the existing framework of the inquest in 1967 or creating a new piece of 
<br/>legislation as in the case in United Kingdom where they have introduced the Presumption of Death 
<br/>Act.

<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1671 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also noted that the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Police were 
<br/>based on the then Strategic Framework for Change Co-ordinating Office (SFCCO) and without that, 
<br/>it was proper for them to align it to the National Development Plan that is in place.  I will leave it at 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I do so, I will now just highlight to you what has been put forward to the Secretariat regarding 
<br/>the listing of the debate, the batting order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Government, it would be the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, followed by the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.  For the Opposition, we have identified 
<br/>three speakers - honourable Virendra Lal will be first, followed by honourable Ketan Lal and then 
<br/>rounded off by honourable Ioane Naivalurua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will try and  alternate the speakers, so we will begin  with the Opposition and then we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move to the Government before we round it off from the Government side as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  I  now  wish  to  adjourn  Parliament,  so  you  may  enjoy  your  dinner 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before we come back to finish the day’s programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 6.29 p.m.

<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 7.45pm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  have  got  a  list  of  speakers  submitted  by  the 
<br/>Whips.  On the Opposition is honourable Virendra Lal, honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Iowane 
<br/>Naivalurua.    From  the  Government  is  honourable  Pio  Tikoduadua  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  
<br/>honourable Prof. Biman Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.– Mr Speaker Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before Parliament and in 
<br/>doing so, I will start by expressing my disappointment as to how we Members of Parliament were 
<br/>not allowed to take part in the march to protest the dumping of the nuclear wastewater in the oceans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initially, when the permit was issued for the march there were no such conditions where the 
<br/>Members of Parliament would not be allowed to be part of the march.  The understanding was that 
<br/>this march was for the general public - for those who opposed the dumping of the nuclear wastewater 
<br/>in the ocean. We are representatives of the people of this country and we had more reason to be part 
<br/>of this march, as a lot of people outside Suva could not make it to the protest march due to work and 
<br/>other commitments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it was very disrespectful of the police officers to pull us out of the crowd, saying that the 
<br/>march was only for members of certain organizations. Sir, through you, I request the Home Affairs 
<br/>Minister to investigate this and see that this is not repeated in future.  The Government is harping 
<br/>about the protest march to take place but putting restrictions on MP’s who were willing to be part of 
<br/>this peaceful march.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I was very surprised to read in the media that the crime rate has dropped in the country.  
<br/>According to the police, crime has dropped significantly but the reality on the ground is something 
<br/>else.  As a Member of Parliament I visit a lot of settlements throughout Fiji and according to the 
<br/>people on the ground the crime rate has actually increased.  I have been told that theft in houses, 
<br/>shops and office break-ins, and burglaries have increased in a lot of settlements.   Family members 
<br/>sacrifice their sleep to take turns to keep watch on their properties and belongings at night and the 
<br/>sad thing is that a lot of people do not report these incidents because according to them, police will 
<br/>not take any action and then they themselves will become police targets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  also  reports  of  police  officers  not  wanting  to  write  down  reports.    They  make 
<br/>ordinary citizens do a lot of run around and after sometimes, these ordinary citizens get fed-up and 
<br/>decide not to register their complaints. Sir, I can give you many examples of such incidents taking 
<br/></span><span>place and despite a lot of people witnessing it, they are hesitant to come forward as witnesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I request the honourable Minister for Home Affairs to relook at the operations of the Fiji 
<br/>Police Force and work with communities to help reduce crime so that people can live peacefully.  
<br/>With those words, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief and try to stick to the Report as 
<br/>opposed to trying to digress on other matters. Nevertheless, I take into account the points that have 
<br/>been raised by my honourable friend with regards to the concerns about the march and other matters 
<br/></span><span>with regards to law and order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the current Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
<br/>and Defence for tabling this Report.  I recognised the report almost immediately when honourable 
<br/>Naupoto presented it to Parliament, as it sounded very familiar to me, given that it was the Report by 
<br/>a Committee which I was a Member of.  I am the lone standing Member in Parliament today that 
<br/>wrote that Report and I am familiar with the recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1673 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  can  assure  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  at  the  centre  of  the  work  that  the  Police  is  doing, 
<br/>particularly  the  review  that  we  have.  We  would  like  to  address  these  issues  and  many  more.    I 
<br/>recognise these issues that you are saying because I get these complaints day in and day out from 
<br/>Members of Parliament and the community, but this points to a bigger problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  a  problem  that  the  Force  has  acquired  over  a  long  time.      We  can  start 
<br/>pointing fingers at who is to blame - Commissioner who, Commissioner who.  We have a former 
<br/>Commissioner here. The honourable Naivalurua is a former Commissioner but we cannot go blaming 
<br/>people about whose fault it was that it started.  Something I can say definitely and attest to is that I 
<br/>have inherited this as the Minister for Home Affairs, and it is something that I must do to improve 
<br/>and build the capacity of the Force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for these recommendations 
<br/>and I can only assure Parliament that I am going to look at it seriously and this is one of the areas, 
<br/>like I said, is at the centre stage of our work.  I just want to perhaps remind Parliament, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>on one of the initiatives that we are taking right now which is the Restore Blue process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Restore Blue is something that Government has set on the Fiji Police Force to restore it to 
<br/>what it was renowned for in the past - a professional force led by Police officers from Fiji, that were 
<br/>friendly to  the public, that  understood their work, understood the law and the limitations of their 
<br/>work.    They  should  understand  that  they  are  there  for  the  people  and  they  are  not  there  for  the 
<br/>organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember before the start of the march when I was talking to the Commissioner after they 
<br/>had given the permit for the march to happen, I told him you know you only have two jobs – secure 
<br/>the marchers and secure the public. Allow the people to march because that is the mark of democracy 
<br/>that is what we all want to do.  But this kind of significant work and understanding of work that the 
<br/>Police should have, is something that the whole Police Force needs to be re-engineered, thus this 
<br/>concept of Restore Blue.  That is really at the centre of our work and part of that is to involve the 
<br/>community in a very big way, as I have noted in Parliament before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community Policing should be at the centre stage, but there are many other capabilities that 
<br/>we  have  to  build  -  professional  Police  officer,  technology  and  the  whole  works,  their  offices.    I 
<br/>continue to say that the Police Headquarters (in one of our reports I know in the last Parliament), in 
<br/>Nabua, while it is out of the way it is actually not safe.  It is constructed on top of restaurants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  an  incident  the  last  time,  where  there  was  an  explosion  and  the  whole  Police 
<br/></span><span>Headquarters was under a whole lot of risk, but that is only one.  If you look at the main divisions, I 
<br/>cannot really share it, but it is very hard sometimes to try and understand how the Police do their 
<br/>work.  If someone talks to me about the Military, I know it like it is at the back of my hand.  This is 
<br/>why I am saying, the Police needs to be reformed, and they need change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current Police Force is almost 90 percent </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> and the excuse that we had been given 
<br/>is that this is based on competency.  It is not reflective of our society.  It is a very few other than 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> who are members of the Police.  The Police has to be generally reflective of the society where 
<br/></span><span>we are.  As much as the assurance given that I am ready to accept the complaints, we will still feel 
<br/></span><span>that they cannot go to the Police, but why.  This is not something that has just developed recently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the Police report from long ago, it has been continuously highlighted.  I know 
<br/>in  the  term  of  my  Parliament,  every  Police  annual  report  that  came  across,  we  made  these 
<br/>recommendations.  Half the time we were rubbished in this Parliament, and people just did not want 
<br/>to recognise it.  Crime is not a matter of the Police, crime is a matter of society.  We are willing under

<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the “Restore Blue” theme, to involve everyone.  I know we wanted to start in this Parliament, but we 
<br/>need to make this political commitment.  I am ready on behalf of the Government to listen to the way 
<br/>that we can improve this and make it better for our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on forever, but I am sure I do not want to lose my audience, but 
<br/>tonight  I  recognise  the  recommendations  that  there  are  and  I  am  making  this  commitment  for 
<br/>Government,  that  I  would  like  to  re-professionalise  the  Force.    I  want  to  seriously  look  at  its 
<br/>composition, look at the leadership and look at all the major capabilities that the Force needs to have, 
<br/>because their primary responsibility is to keep Fijians safe, everyone, from harm, threat, and from 
<br/>being abused by anyone.  I would like to make this commitment to this Parliament and the people, 
<br/>we will do our best to try and correct some of the very major weaknesses that we have and we will 
<br/>stand up, and we actually do have weaknesses.   But,  hopefully in  time, under the ‘Restore Blue’ 
<br/>theme, we will be able to fix these issues, however, many there may be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today in support of the review report presented by 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, concerning the Fiji Police Force 2018 to 
<br/>2019 Annual Report.  This Report signifies an important step towards ensuring the safety, security 
<br/>and overall well-being of our nation’s citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the Committee for its thorough analysis and dedication to addressing the critical 
<br/>aspects of the Fiji Police Force operations and administration.  The Committee’s review brings to 
<br/>light several pertinent issues that warrant our attention.  The Report underscores the importance of 
<br/>adopting  modern  technologies,  such  as  satellite,  geospatial  and  drone  technologies  to  address  the 
<br/>chronic  traffic  congestion  on  Fiji’s  roads.    As  we  all  know  traffic  congestion  not  only  impacts 
<br/>productivity, but also poses risks to public safety.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by investing in advanced technology we can revolutionise our approach to 
<br/>traffic  management,  reducing  congestion  and  ensuring  smoother  mobility  for  our  citizens.    The 
<br/>Committee identifies the need for increased representation of women in senior positions within the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force.  While progress has been made, there remains ample room for improvement by 
<br/>encouraging  and  facilitating  women  officers  to  access  leadership  training,  and  we  can  diversify 
<br/>perspectives and harness the full potential of our Force.  Empowered women in leadership positions 
<br/>will undoubtedly contribute to enhanced decision making and community engagement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reports observation of an increasing prevalence of crime against women 
<br/>and children as well as suicide, is deeply concerning and we must note this month is also a month 
<br/></span><span>where we create awareness on suicide prevention.  It is our duty Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the safety 
<br/></span><span>and wellbeing of the most vulnerable members of our society. The report urges us to take positive 
<br/>intervention measures to counter these distressing trends, re-enforcing the importance of community 
<br/>outreach and support systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the report acknowledges the ongoing 5 Year reform and restructure project 
<br/>undertaken by the Fiji Police Force.  This commitment to evolution demonstrates a forward-thinking 
<br/>approach that ensures the Force remains adaptable and effective in a rapidly changing environment. 
<br/>The Committee’s recommendation for the Fiji Police Force to provide a gender desegrated data and 
<br/></span><span>develop  a  gender  policy  is  commendable.    In  a  society  that  values  equity  this  step  will  not  only 
<br/></span><span>enhance transparency but also allow us to access the progress of gender related initiatives effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  evident  from  the  Committee’s  analysis  the  report  serves  as  a 
<br/>comprehensive roadmap for strengthening the Fiji Police Force and ensuring its alignment with our 
<br/>nation’s goals.  In addressing these issues, we are demonstrating our commitment for the wellbeing 
<br/>of our citizens and prosperity of our society.  Moreover, I wish to address the concerns raised about 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1675 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decline  in  customer  service  after  change  of  government.  While  change  can  sometimes  bring 
<br/>challenges, I am confident that lessons learnt from this report will enable us to maintain, even enhance 
<br/>the quality of customer service as we continuously work towards improvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to add what my honourable colleague from the Opposition 
<br/>Chambers mentioned in respect to the protest march.  I myself was one of those first MPs or Members 
<br/>of  Parliament  from  the  Opposition  Chambers  to  join  the  protest  march  at  around  9.30am.  
<br/>Unfortunately, I was removed from the march by the police officers, the excuse they gave was that I 
<br/>was an MP and I cannot be part of that protest or that march. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the 
<br/>end of the day I am still a citizen and this is a violation of my right according to the Constitution 
<br/>under Freedom of Assembly, where “every person has the right, peaceably and unarmed to assemble, 
<br/>demonstrate, picket and to present petitions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also to highlight that previously I think in 2017 politicians were also part of 
<br/>demonstrations or marches and at the same time, our former Attorney-General, former Minister for 
<br/>Climate Change, the former Prime Minister were also removed from the vicinity where the march or 
<br/>protest came to a conclusion because they were politicians according to the police.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>these are a violation of our rights.  If we cannot represent the people’s voice and those two gentlemen 
<br/>who are no longer in Parliament, they are citizens of Fiji as well.  They have every right to protest, 
<br/>they have every right to be part of every movement that is happening in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been an increase in crime rate as I have highlighted on 
<br/>my political social media page.  There is a temple in Lautoka which  has been broken into five times 
<br/>according to this temples’ post - they have said, five times since this year.  The police are not taking 
<br/>any effective action and I am happy to provide the Minister with the relevant details.  There have 
<br/>been complaints where police are not taking action with respect to complaints lodged with them and 
<br/>I have highlighted this to the Minister recently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing Mr. Speaker, Sir, I extend my gratitude to the Committee for their diligence and 
<br/>thorough analysis of the Fiji Police Reports performance and I also commend the Commissioner of 
<br/>Police, Officers and the staff for their dedication to securing our nation by embracing the findings 
<br/>and recommendations of this report.  We are fostering a safe and more inclusive and more prosperous 
<br/>Fiji for all citizens, and I support this motion Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am speaking in support of this review report 
<br/>as I am also a Member of the Standing Committee.  The Report itself is a few years old and if we 
<br/></span><span>would like to talk about the Report, we really will not be able to fully understand what this Report is 
<br/></span><span>all about but it is very important for us to understand the 2018 and 2019 Report in the sense that it 
<br/>was one of the key platforms or years that the Fiji Police had wanted to use as the basis of establishing 
<br/>a firm based in trying to reform and improve the Fiji Police Force.   This was in line with the five-
<br/>year reform and restructure plan set by the organisation the Fiji Police Force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole purpose of the reform  programme was really to  improve the Fiji  Police Force. 
<br/>Align the Fiji Police Force to the changing, policing environment involving times and above all most 
<br/>importantly to ensure that the organisation or the Fiji Police Force was properly equipped, resourced 
<br/></span><span>and positive to meet the challenges of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century.  I am emphasising the importance of the 21</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/></span><span>century. There are many things that are happening right now in our part of the world that really our 
<br/>Fiji Police Force are not able to handle because they are not properly resourced.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As someone that had the honour of serving in the Fiji Police Force for a few years it is a tough 
<br/>mission and I admire and respect the Commissioner and his officers who are serving right now.  I 
<br/>remembered one of the first things that I did when I took over the office in 2010, I stated very clearly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>
<div><span>1676 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the organisation, especially the senior officers, I stated, I am here to improve the Fiji Police Force. 
<br/>And to do that we must rid of politics of race. We must rid of politics, of religion and we must rid of 
<br/>politics of empire building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And that is something that I believe needs to be changed within the Force.  It is got to be 
<br/>based on merit, the ability to perform and above all the ability to serve the people which is really the 
<br/>core purpose of the Force.  People are centred in everything that they do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 1,001 things that needs to be done in the Force if we reduce it, we 
<br/>can say may be there is 101 things.   In my view, perhaps we should focus on the 11 key things which 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  is  being  talking  about  in  restoring  blue.    You  can  use  any  colour  coded 
<br/>terminology or themes but at the end of the day it is about the ability of the Force to remain trusted 
<br/>and be trusted by the public or society at large. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  they  must  spend  time  and  resource  to  professionalise  their  leaders  and  this 
<br/>particular case I am calling for I am sure the honourable Minister is already working on it a success 
<br/>planning for the leadership part of the Force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the importance of really providing what they need to have resourced to confront the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issues that they have to be confronted with on a daily basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to fast track some of the programmes or projects that are part of the plans and push 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them forward. And above all the ability to look after the officers’ men and women of the Force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my own observation, I think I believe the Fiji Police Force is on track in 
<br/>serving the people of Fiji better provided that we resource them fully. We equip them and posture 
<br/>them fully to meet the challenges of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the recommendation and I am sure when we debate the other 
<br/>two reports that will be submitted later here, we will fully understand the needs of the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force. And I call on the Members of this august House to understand the role of the Fiji Police Force, 
<br/>support them fully and of course resource and equip them to meet the challenges of their work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Members  and  the  honourable  Minister  for  providing  a  very  detailed  explanation  as  to  what  the 
<br/>Ministry is engaging at the moment, to reform the Police Force in a way that is responsive, efficient 
<br/></span><span>and effective in dealing with the people generally, of course, reducing the crime rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important for us to say this.  In many ways, the Police Force over the 
<br/>last so many years was  politicised to  some extent.  The Police Force was also  kind  of politically 
<br/>weaponised to engage at a political level to be off track in addressing the fundamental issues.  The 
<br/>honourable Minister highlighted some of the issues that confront the Force at the moment.  I know 
<br/>the honourable Naivalurua has made a very important set of points about what the Police Force ought 
<br/>to be, what the Police Force was and can be and what it is, and I agree with him wholeheartedly that 
<br/>it is the way in which the Police Force ought to operate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He talked about resources.  I agree with him 100 percent.  If you look at the 2018  – 2019 
<br/>Budget Sir, the allocation was $193.5 million, but the actual amount that was utilised was only $150.3 
<br/>million which is about 78 percent of the allocation.  In this  year’s Budget, Sir, we have allocated 
<br/>about  $183.7  million  and  of  this  around  94  percent  of  the  Budget  is  allocated  for  operating 
<br/>expenditure while only 3 percent is earmarked for capital projects.

<div><span> Review Report – FPF August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1677 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the budgetary process Sir, we have made sure that the Police Force is adequately 
<br/>resourced.    We  have  provided  additional  funding  for  Police  Beat  because  we  believe  that  police 
<br/>presence  is  very  important  in  crime  deterrence  generally.    Apart  from  the  technological 
<br/>advancements, drones and CCTV cameras, police presence is very important, especially in densely 
<br/>populated areas around Suva, Nausori and other urban centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure Mr. Speaker, Sir, where they are reading those statistics.  Yes, I get complaints 
<br/>about police.  I get complaints about crime rates in different areas.  I was in Vanua Levu and I met 
<br/>the Police and I asked the community generally, basically, they told me that the crime rate in Labasa 
<br/>is very low.  In fact, they see an improvement.  There are areas in the Central Division where it seems 
<br/>to have increased, there are more incidents of robbery, petty theft; but the overall statistics that has 
<br/>been provided by the Commissioner of Police recently shows that the overall crime rate has actually 
<br/>gone down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the honourable Members on the other side; honourable Virendra Lal and honourable 
<br/>Ketan Lal.  I have talked about increasing crime rate, but they need to put it into a proper perspective 
<br/>and put that in the context of what the police is saying as to what is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was actually quite surprised Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they were complaining about the march.  
<br/>I do not know what the condition of the permit was.  I know they were NGOs, in fact some them that 
<br/>I talked to, they said we did not want FijiFirst Members of Parliament with their FijiFirst t-shirt and 
<br/>shirts turning up there and wanting to protest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Usamate talks about hypocrisy ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- It is something ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- But that is actually quite shameful that not only the General 
<br/>Secretary of the FijiFirst Party, the former Prime Minister and all these people who know for years 
<br/>they scuttle,  they stopped protest, peaceful marches in this country.  In fact, they should thank the 
<br/>Coalition Government, thank the honourable Prime Minister for leading a Government which is fully 
<br/>committed to genuine democracy and allowing the protest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- So wasteful.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-... quite shameful that they all ended up there with the FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>t-shirts… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Oh, whatever and whoever they were there, Mr. Speaker. But 
<br/>the point is, (he is showing the Constitution) he probably does not understand what his bosses were 
<br/>trying to do with that Constitution.  But, it is important that we, as the honourable Minister said quite 
<br/>rightly, that we want people to have the right to protest.  We want to allow marches, but it has to be 
<br/>done within the law.  For them to come and complain about not being out is actually quite hilarious.

<div><span> Review Report – CAAF 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Sept., 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- The former Attorney-General and the former Prime Minister are citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …the point raised by honourable Naivalurua that the Police 
<br/>Force, as far as we are concerned, in terms of the budget, the utilisation and the allocation in the 2023 
<br/>– 2024 Budget  in our view, is adequate.  As we move ahead, in terms of the review and the operation 
<br/>that the honourable Minister talked about, we would be looking at additional support for the Police 
<br/>Force in the next Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just one point.  When we did the deliberations and 
<br/>when  we  read  the  Annual  Report,  there  is  nothing  there  that  said  the  Police  Force  was  being 
<br/>politicised otherwise you would have seen in the Report that we produced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank those that contributed to the debate.  I thank the team for coming up 
<br/>with this report.  We have four new members in the team, Sir, new Members of Parliaments, so we 
<br/>have to learn on the job in the absence of induction and training on how Committee works.  If I may, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank the Fiji Police Force for the work that they do, their line of work exposes 
<br/>them to the ugly side of humanity, and they need our support.  With their families also for the support 
<br/>that they provide to them, and I implore the Police to continue their work to act justly and fairly as 
<br/>they do the very important work that they do for the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commend this Report to Parliament for noting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
