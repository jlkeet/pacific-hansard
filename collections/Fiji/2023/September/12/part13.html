<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Update on High Turnover of Teachers (Question No. 102/2023) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the number of teachers who have resigned in the first half of this year and what plans does the Ministry have to address the high turnover of its teaching staff? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this question comes in two prongs; one is relating to the statistical information that is required which I would like to give the answers to. The information that is extracted is from the Ministry of Education system which is known as the Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS) as of 8 th September, 2023. On the number of teachers who have resigned from January to June 2023, 80 percent of them have migrated for greener pastures and 20 percent have moved around to other job opportunities in the Pacific region and in Fiji. The total number of teachers who have resigned is 469, with one deemed to have resigned, and the breakdown is outlined in the table below.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1693 2023 January February March April May June Total ECE Primary Secondary Total number of teachers who have resigned Vocational (Deemed to have resigned) - - - 1 - - 1 66 38 68 23 41 29 265 26 21 28 24 42 28 169 7 3 7 5 6 7 35 Total 99 62 103 53 89 64 470 On the second part of the question, Mr. Speaker Sir, to address the exodus of our teachers and the Ministry of Education in ensuring that teaching and learning environment for our students is not at any time compromised, the following strategies have been implemented to address the high turnover of teachers. On the recruitment of new teachers for 2023: ECE – 96; Special School – 6; Primary School – 303; and Secondary Schools - 164. We have employed a total of 569 new graduates as of August 2023. On re-engagement of retirees: Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of Education has also re-engaged retirees from the age of 55 years as per the Ministry of Civil Service Guide. Re-engagement was done through expression of interest processes and for 2023, there were 38 Secondary School teachers who have retired in 2022 and 24 were re-engaged due to lack of teachers in specific areas, like Maths, Physics, Computer and Office Technology which honourable Premila Kumar who had initially wanted to remove from schools in 2022. PEMAC Teachers and Industrial Arts: Retirees were re-engaged as even the new graduates do not meet the demand in this specialized area. The criteria for recruitment is based on merit and I had to ensure there is no nepotism entertained in this recruitment, unlike what the former head of HR at the Ministry, honourable Hem Chand, did last year when he recruited his own wife as the Head of School at Gurukul.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Standing Orders 62(1) on improper motive. He has mentioned that I have promoted my wife. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sit down! MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue. HON. H. CHAND.- May I continue? MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. He is elaborating on his point of order. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker Sir, he has mentioned that I had promoted my wife - that is totally incorrect. He has to provide evidence, or he has to withdraw. For his information, I was not head of HR when my wife was promoted, she was promoted in 2019. I became head of HR in 2020.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1694</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He has to provide evidence:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- He has to provide evidence:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I was just clarifying that he was the head of HR. Were you not the head of HR before you joined politics? MR. SPEAKER.- I am trying to divulge all that now in the space of time that is being allowed. At the same time, you have your differences. I have now asked the honourable Minister to continue because of the kind of statistics that you wanted. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Primary Schools - 80 teachers retired and 46 were re-engaged. For the nine ECE teachers who had retired, not one of them have expressed for re-engagement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another strategy that the Ministry of Education has used is the re- engagement of teachers who suffered termination due to the ‘No Jab No Job policy’. There were 190 teachers who were terminated and 119 showed interest and have been re-engaged. From those 22 ECE teachers who were terminated, only five were re-engaged and there were 105 primary school teachers terminated. Sir, 63 have expressed interest to be re-engaged. With the secondary school teachers, 63 were terminated and 51 were re-engaged on the relaxation of the ‘No Jab No Job’ policy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has implemented the above strategies to address teacher shortage in our schools. We have already executed the plans to ensure that quality education in all our 176 Secondary Schools, 736 Primary Schools and more than 800 ECE Centres are not at any time compromised as we are committed to ‘leaving no child behind’. The Ministry of Education is currently working and discussing with local universities and training institutions on the alignment of subject combination on the intake of education programmes in line with the need in our schools as we are the biggest employers of graduates from universities in regards to the teaching profession. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the high turnover of teachers has created vacancies in ECE Centres, Special Schools, Primary Schools and also Secondary Schools. The increase in VAT, high cost of living, no increase in teachers’ pay have contributed to the high turnover of teachers. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Nonsense! HON. H. CHAND.- My question is, the number of secondary trained teachers teaching in primary schools has increased. What support is the Ministry providing or is planning to provide to secondary trained teachers teaching in primary schools so that teaching and learning is not compromised? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to our records, the number of secondary school graduates teaching in primary schools have reduced in numbers and we are working towards reducing the number of secondary school graduates teaching in primary schools. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Minister for that lengthy answer and I think he has learnt from his predecessor, Dr… Reddy on giving long and lengthy answers in Parliament. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1695 MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, it is almost nine months now when the honourable Minister actually stated in this Parliament that he has actually initiated an investigation into appointments of Heads of Schools in December. Can the honourable Minister give an update on the outcome of that particular investigation and when is he going to present a report to Parliament? If he has found nothing out of that investigation, when is he going to appoint those Heads of Schools for whom the appointment was withheld by the honourable Minister? MR. SPEAKER.- That sounds like a new question to me, honourable Maharaj. (Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was very interested in the turnover of teachers, in particular the number - 401. I would just like to get a grip on this, not just in terms of the numbers but I think it will be more compelling for me in terms of the trend. Is this an increase or is it stagnant or is it is a decrease? If so, whatever the trend is happening, what sort of mitigation factors or mitigatory factors or adaptive factors are you trying to do in the Ministry to address that? I know for a fact that the ratio of teachers to school children is quite large. I am also aware of the fact that when you have young teachers coming out, there are a lot of complaints about them. Some of them cannot even speak proper English when they are teaching English. So, I am interested in the trend and how you are adapting to the findings that you are finding from those trends. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Usamate, I do not really follow you on that. You wanted a grip on the data? HON. J. USAMATE.- The trends, is it going up, is it going down and whatever you are learning from that and how you are adapting to it over the past few years or so? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Sir, the information that I have is only for the last six months,</p><h4>but I can come back to the honourable Member if he could put those questions in writing.</h4><p>The trend is inconsistent, it is not increasing. With the latest number, it has decreased as of June. If you want it from July, I can also provide that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- I am interested in the trend over the past few years:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.:</span> Past few years, maybe the honourable Member can assist.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- I am asking you as the Minister:</span></p><p>Renovation Costs - Prime Minister’s Residence (Question No. 103/2023) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament on the total cost of renovating the Prime Minister’s residence at Muanikau? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1696</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 question. The former Prime Minister and the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama, vacated the Government-owned residence at Muanikau Road on 10 th February, 2023. He moved to another Government Quarters at Domain where he signed up to pay rent at the market rate. We know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Mr. Bainimarama continued to occupy the Muanikau residence after the new Government was sworn in, in which used to be the official residence of the former Chief Justice. We were also informed that the former Prime Minister was also using the Ratu Sukuna Road residence for meetings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2017 and 2018, there was major refurbishment works undertaken at the Prime Minister’s residence at Muanikau which was done through the Construction Implementation Unit which used to be in the Ministry of Economy. When we came into Government, it is now under the Public Service Commission. The initial cost approved by the Government Tender Board was $2,472,962. The contractor was Grace Road Food Company Limited. There were four variations that were approved by the Government Tender Board which increased the cost to $3,053,773, with an increase of around $581,000. In addition to that, the cost of the lead consultant - Maisuria Design Limited was around $417,000. The total renovation cost comes to about $3.5 million. When the new Government came in, before the honourable Prime Minister moved into the residence, the Public Works Department had checked the residence at Ratu Sukuna Road and upon assessment, they had advised that they would need some renovations to ensure that the residence is fit for the Prime Minister, honourable Sitiveni Rabuka, to move in. The total cost was $162,865 and the breakdown is as follows: (a) Minor maintenance works - $33,000; (b) Sliding gate repair works - $8,500; (c) (d) Procurement of furniture and fixtures - $120,785 (the biggest component of the $162,000). Intense cleaning and servicing of kitchen and laundry appliances - $580; and We were told that before the honourable Prime Minister moved in, the assessment was that there was no furniture. We were told that there was no register of furniture with the Government for the former Prime Minister. The assumption was that the furniture that was there was removed and was actually owned by the former Prime Minister. The cost of the new furniture for our honourable Prime Minister was $120,000 and the total was $162,000. That is the breakdown of the costs. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what is the intention of the question. Are you going to investigate that renovation? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what is his intention. All I am doing is answering a question by the honourable Member about the cost of renovation. The public deserves to know, and if there is a need for investigation, it will be done. In fact, if you look at the cost incurred at the former Chief Justice’s residence, I do not think there was any big structural change. Almost half a million dollars was paid to the lead consultant to redesign and if you look at the four variations and the total cost of $3.5 million, it is a bit unusual to know. The furniture at the former Prime Minister’s residence was not provided by Government, so I do not know what happened there. If the honourable Leader of the Opposition is interested to know what happened and if there is a need for investigation, it will be done.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1697 MR. SPEAKER.- I do not think that the intent of the question by the honourable Assistant Minister was really to see that an investigation be undertaken. All he was seeking was raised in his question, just for information purpose. Mitigation Plans to Alleviate Mass Resignation of Nurses (Question No. 104/2023) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on mitigation plans to alleviate the mass resignation of nurses, especially the zone nurses who usually provide Primary Healthcare Awareness activities? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Ravunawa for that question. In terms of what the Ministry is doing on our mitigation plans to alleviate the mass resignation of nurses, it includes our retention strategy, and the strategies are increase in salary for registered nurses (Band F) according to years of experience. This results in the payment of scarce skills for those with more than 15 years of experience. Another point is the introduction of the 8 percent retention allowance for all cadre of nurses and the re-introduction of consolidated allowance for nurses based at nursing stations. These will attract nurses to take up public health roles, especially for nursing stations in our rural areas and also relieving appointments should the need arise for zone nurses. Relievers are remunerated with subsistence and meal allowance accordingly. As for the second part of the question, with regards to the zone nurses and serving in rural communities, nursing will revert to the one-year internship for newly graduates to allow availability of fully fledged nurses to fill up the vacant positions in public health. The Ministry is also focusing on the welfare of its officers (nurses) working in nursing stations and health centres. Some of their stations and quarters have been identified to have renovations done. Sir, we have seen that some of the facilities have not been renovated for some time, so we have allocated funds for that. Also, the engagement of retired nurses, especially nurses who are above 60 years old, most applicants are willing to do public health nursing. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable Minister for the mitigation plan that has been read out in Parliament this morning. A reminder again that healthcare services is not only provided by nurses. Will the honourable Minister consider other cadre in the healthcare sector? Also, I would like to raise that Section 39 of our Constitution states the right to health and for everyone to be cared for with quality and effective health services. The mitigation strategies read out for nurses is a noble one, will the honourable Minister also consider other cadre of the Ministry? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for that supplementary question. Yes, the Ministry is considering other cadre as well in terms of adequately remunerating them. That has been brought to Cabinet and also with the Ministry of Civil Service, that the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is prioritised should any reform be taken. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite surprised this morning to know that 80 percent out of the 441 teachers have left the country. That shows zero confidence in this Government. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Rubbish!</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1698</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 (Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mitigation plans for the nurses, I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Health …. MR. SPEAKER.- I think you have disturbed an hornet’s nest.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen to the Speaker:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I think with your earlier statement, you have stirred an hornet’s nest. Please, go straight to your supplementary question, honourable Sharma.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> Yes, Sir, I will go my question, thank you.</p><p>From the discussions of the Ministry with FNA in terms of the strike that was intending to happen, are there any outcomes of pay rise for the nurses in regards to mitigating the mass resignation of nurses? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Member for that question. Yes, indeed, it is an ongoing discussion between the working group represented by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the Ministry of Civil Service and stakeholders such as FNA. The points that I have raised in terms of budgetary allocation for the current one is based on their findings. It is an ongoing discussion between the working group on how best we can move forward with their needs - we are talking with them. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question to the honourable Minister, with this massive resignation of nurses, I think the honourable Minister is well aware that in most nursing stations and health centres, the pharmacy is managed by the nurses. MR. SPEAKER.- Could you declare your interest here?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am not in the public sector, so no interest at all.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Having said that, since the pharmacy’s daily operations will be affected because the nurses are leaving, are there any plans with FNU to introduce pharmacy assistant courses so that these nurses can be replaced by pharmacy assistants graduating from FNU? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question but I will try and answer it. Whilst going around to most of the facilities, we noted that most public pharmacies are run by pharmacy assistants and there is a need for them in the public sector. We are talking with tertiary institutions if they can be provide some sort of learning platform. MR. SPEAKER.- That was the third supplementary question. Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.37 a.m.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1699 The Parliament resumed at 11.15 a.m. Work Programme on Solar Installation (Question No. 105/2023) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on the work programme for the installation of solar around the country in this financial year? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. For the past 15 years, the Ministry has installed approximately 15,000 solar home systems to rural, remote and maritime areas of Fiji. These systems have provided essential lighting and support for electrical loads of up to 300 watts in size. These systems have played a pivotal role in promoting economic and social development, particularly in sectors such as health, education, agriculture and commercial, benefitting the residents of these areas immensely. These solar systems have been strategically deployed in areas where extending the conventional electrical grid would be too expensive. There is a lot of demand, and the Department of Energy within the Ministry is working within its allocated budget to achieve as much as possible. In the current financial year, the Government has allocated $3 million for solar home systems. This funding will cover the supply and installation of approximately 1,000 Units. Currently, the necessary materials are undergoing procurement and the installation process will commence within the next two months, in addition to the ongoing installations, and will be completed towards the middle of next year. The initiative underscores the ongoing commitment of Government to improve the lives of our citizens, even in the most remote areas of Fiji, while also contributing to the sustainable and eco- friendly energy solutions. The distributions are throughout the various Provinces, including Bua, Macuata, Caukadrove, Naitasiri, Serua, Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau, Navosa, Yasawa and Ba. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the honourable Minister. In some areas in Caukaudrove where I had visited a couple of months back, their systems start to break down again and getting bad. What is the Ministry doing about that in terms of the repair or servicing of these units? I know that if they are not going to be serviced or if minor repair works are not being done, those units will really get bad quickly. HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member, for that question. In terms of the systems, the ones being currently installed are different from the ones which were previously installed. So, those that were previously installed are now undergoing maintenance and that has been separately budgeted for. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand that the solar initiative is a great initiative for the nation and it is very critical in terms of when you install it. Fiji faces unprecedented and adverse weather conditions. So, for a cyclone of high magnitude, what is the climate resilient and adaptive measures taken to cater for the unprecedented weather? It comes down to the first question. Are there any climate resilient angles or measures to this where the system is climate resilient?</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1700</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 It is not just about taking a system, having money for it and installing it. Is there any climate resilient or adaptative measures or technologies within the solar systems that are being installed in Fiji that can have a sustainability factor in terms of continuity? We need to be climate resilient with the technologies we implement, so my question is based on that. MR. SPEAKER. - I now give the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is very much related to the question by honourable Rinesh Sharma. We thank Government for the continuation of the installation of the new ones but the one that I wanted to ask to the honourable Minister is on those that were damaged in the recent cyclones because there was a separate programme for those as well. I just wanted to know if that has been completed, or is it part of the programme that we are doing for this year? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I was about to answer his question. But, anyway, looking at both questions on climate resilience, that is part of the whole concept of climate resilient infrastructure. So, for the solar infrastructure or systems that have been put in place, that is part of it, that when they install it, that it is also able to withstand certain categories of cyclones. I cannot give the technical details but that is what has been explained to me. On those which were damaged, yes, as I have explained, that is part of the programme of our maintenance and repairs regarding the current solar to also cover those which were damaged because we had visited some villages and they had raised that. I have asked the Department to also incorporate that in the maintenance and repair programme for those which are needed as per our budget. MR. SPEAKER. - That was the third question, but I will allow you to answer. HON. J. USAMATE. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the honourable Minister for continuing with the programme of solarisation. I know there have been a number of phases - Solar Phase 1, Solar Phase 2 and Phase 3, Sir, is the one that I am interested in where you have changed the system. Before, the solar used to belong to Government and you pay $18 per month. I think we have now implemented a system where that solar is then fixed and handed over. If the honourable Minister can just give us an update on how well that is progressing because once it is handed over, then you are liable for the repairs and the parts? If you can just give us a brief update on how that particular phase of the programme is going on now? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU. - Yes, that is the current programme, that we handover to the consumer. From the few villages that we have been to, we have done that and also signed the handover and also clearly explain to them their responsibility. That does not mean that the Ministry is just abandoning them, however, we are also closely liaising with the villagers and Turaga-ni-Koro on how we can assist them in that process. It has been well accepted at the village level on the ones which I have been directly engaged with and also with the Department of Energy. MR. SPEAKER.- With that reply, honourable Minister, I think it would be sufficient for honourable Tuinaceva as well. Does he have to pay the $80?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU. - No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER:</span> – Because now, we have heard from the former Minister that they used to pay $80.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1701</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, $18 per month.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You are responsible for it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Are you content with that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I will liaise with him on the specific locations:</span></p><p>Guaranteed Protection and Restitution – Media Industry Development (Repeal) Act 2023 (Question No. 106/2023) HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: With the enactment of the Media Industry Development (Repeal) Act 2023 which also removed the Code of Conduct, Standards and Advertising Guidelines, can the Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on the protection in place and the avenue for restitution? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Bia for his question. I guess the question probably reflects some of the fundamental differences between this side of Parliament and that side of Parliament. When we say Media Industry Development Act 2010 or MIDA, it conjures up images of concern and repression. In fact, I would like to think that the removal of MIDA has been the cause of much celebration and exuberance that we currently experience in this country. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yes, absolutely! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, when I initially read the honourable Member’s question, I was worried whether he was wanting to bring MIDA back because from this side of Parliament… HON. K. K. LAL.- Just answer the question! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- …Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has gone into the dustbin of history and that is where it will remain. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yes, absolutely!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> I will now answer honourable Bia’s question.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the repeal of the Media Industry Development Act 2010 on 14 th April, 2023, does not mean that there is no longer a code of conduct for journalists in Fiji. Again, this is a fundamental difference between how we view democracy and how the other side of Parliament views democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken time to listen to our journalists and the industry, and it is clear that that the journalists and the media organisations understand their role in the society. The bottom line is, the repeal of the law was necessary to safeguard the media’s independence, while ensuring the public’s right to be informed accurately, fairly and timely.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1702</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 If they had asked the Media Association at that time, they would have known this. In fact, a code of ethics was developed by the Fijian Media Association, and they believe it will be adhered to by media organisations and journalists in this country. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Where is the copy? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why the fundamental difference between us and them. We actually trust people to do the right thing. It sets out ethical principles that journalists should uphold in their work. There are also international best practices and standards which we expect our media organisations and journalists to adhere to. One of the most widely used code of ethics for journalists globally is the Society of Professional Journalist Code of Ethics. It sets out ethical principles that journalists uphold in their work, including truthfulness, accuracy and impartiality. To be honest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the repeal of the Act so far, you can see the balance reporting that is going around… (Laughter) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- … and sometimes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, … (Hon. Opposition Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- …it actually favours the other side of Parliament, so they should be happy. HON. K. K. LAL.- Very poor! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a very long time, Fiji did not have free media, a media that is essential for our functioning democracy. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- In fact, people say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, … MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.-... that free media is the oxygen of democracy. But in the new Fiji, Sir, we have done it. That is how you preserve democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- In addition to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have laws in place, including laws on defamation, the right to privacy and the right to protect children. Alongside this, of course, we have the watchdogs.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1703 HON. K. K. LAL.- Who? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The Consumer Council of Fiji and the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission which can receive complaints from the public on various matters, inclusive of those mentioned, particularly in terms of false advertising. Section 78 of the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission Act talks about false advertising. I urge you all to look it up - it addresses the concerns that have been raised in this question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, MIDA had to go, the whole of Fiji is happy with the removal of MIDA and now, we have real democracy arriving in Fiji. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. A. BIA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do understand and the whole of Fiji knows that the Media Industry Development Act has been repealed and now amended. But simply, the question that I had asked was, what avenues are there, at the moment, to protect or the protection avenues that are in place - avenues for restitution for journalists and reporters that are there because currently it is still in the process?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Nine months, it is still in the process.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.:</span> What are you doing in nine months? MR. SPEAKER.- I am at a loss here. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, try and go along with the supplementary question you have raised, especially on the restitution part. What are you trying to restore? HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the previous Media Industry Development Act, journalists are protected in terms of doing their work. This is in regards to mistakes, may be in writing or in reporting. There are laws that do protect them if there is a complaint from a third party in terms of stories being broadcasted or stories being written online. The question simply says, it is in the process at the moment, so what avenues are there to project journalists and reporters since the Act is still in the process and finalising is in place? (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am, kind of, trying to work out the right answer to say, Sir, but if it is for the protection of journalists, I think the law is there to protect them should there be concerns. HON. K. K. LAL.- Which law? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The defamation law is there. I read defamation here in my reply. So, if that is what you are after, there is certainly avenues for journalists to use.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1704</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 The other thing, Sir, that I did not put in here is just because it has not been formalised, is that there is also the Media Council that is about to be established. The holdup is really with some documentary requirements at the Office of the Registrar of Companies, which I am trying to assist with, but that will mean that the industry as a whole will be self-regulating. That is true democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They have actually selected the seven Council members who are very capable citizens of Fiji, and they are expected to act independently and adjudicate on issues of concern in terms of media. To be honest, I think there are adequate mechanisms in place. I know the other side of Parliament was obsessed with regulating everything, maybe because of one person who is no longer here. I can assure Parliament that by the time the Council is set up, there will be adequate mechanisms in place to address concerns around media conduct and the like. Required Standards for Imported Food Items (Question No. 107/2023) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on the measures that are in place to ensure that imported food items meet the required standard so as to avert the rising cases of Non-Communicable Diseases in the country? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Food and Safety Act 2003 and its subsidiary legislation, currently enforced by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, looks into matters promoting public health and safety. Also the Codex Alimentarius or Food Code is a collection of standards, guidelines and codes of practice adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and are referenced in the Food Safety Regulations of 2009. Apart from this, the Department of National Trade Measurements and Standards, the Trade Standards and Quality Control Act of 2009, creates national standards for goods and services that basically provide technical requirements, for example, making a product, managing a process, delivering a service or supplying materials. Furthermore, the Ministry has created standards in the areas of building and construction, communication and technology, consumer goods and management systems of trade management. Currently, the only standard related to food is the wheat standard - FS5-2003, fortification of flour, which sets out the requirements for calculation on minimum standards for wheat flour. This standard is also regulated by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. The existing measurement legislation or the National Trade and Management Act 1989 and its regulations, like the regulations on pre-packaged goods, deals with labelling requirements on certain food items. Under the National Trade Management legislation, importers and sellers of pre- packaged goods must ensure their packages are correctly labelled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues to work closely with other core Government agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, in ensuring that practical and proper measures are in place to protect the food industry and the consumers at large. We will continue to look at other sector standards, should industries or the Government need to adopt them in future. As a way forward, possibly, the Government could consider having a food regulation system of its own but that, of course, will be subject to the Cabinet discussions but that is something that can</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1705 be done to improve the overall framework in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this system should cover topics ranging from safety, labelling, composition of food and handling requirements, and could be spearheaded by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. In fact, in Australia and New Zealand, they do a have a joint corporative system that currently handles food regulations. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, listening to the honourable Minister, he is actually lost. He does not know what he is talking about - we are talking about imported food items, imported food items are actually self-regulated, honourable Minister. We do not have standards for imported food items. The standards we have is mainly for the food that we are exporting out. We are protecting the consumers of other countries rather than the consumers of this country. Can you tell us how many food standards are there and how are these developed? Is your Ministry developing it, or is it the Ministry of Health and Medical Services or is Codex developing it? In fact, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs had a meeting… HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> No, it is an important issue, we are talking about food.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> What is your question? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I am coming to that. The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs had a meeting with health, trade and other stakeholders and we realised that there was no one actually controlling the standards of imported food coming into the country. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Stop grandstanding, what is your question? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- So, can you specifically tell us which agency is setting the standard for imported food and how is that being controlled? Ask consumers, ask yourself when you go to these supermarkets, the kind of rubbish that is being sold in supermarkets. We are talking about standard, we are talking about quality, so where is the quality, honourable Minister? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that is a totally new question and so let me just put you at ease. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Oh! You have missed out</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- No answer:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You are the Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Let me just put you at ease:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> What were you doing for four years? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Firstly, sometimes when we say things, we need to think</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1706</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 that it reflects back on us. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> No, that is not it at all.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> So, after 16 years, what she is saying is that she has done absolutely nothing about food standards when she was in the Ministry. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- What are you doing? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, I will leave it at that Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think just to allay your concerns, it is a concern on this side of the Parliament and sadly, our Ministry. I have received a lot of reports on incorrect labelling, on food that is not of the right standard, particularly tinned fish. So, we are currently undertaking some investigation through the Consumer Council, as you know they do that work. I have a few reports with me which most likely, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will have to do something or create an Act or develop some regulation around but what I would like to say Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that it is a concern on this side of Parliament and it has been worked on through the Consumer Council.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No standards that is why.:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> You are in government, what are you doing? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to remind us of a case of an imported tinned fish that was displayed in this august Parliament by honourable Qereqeretabua. That is an example of what they were trying to get through. (Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. The question asked was in regards to imported food and standards. So, my question is around sub-standards and I will formulate my question in this way. What is the regulatory mechanism taken by honourable Manoa, someone who has gone against fundamental differences and has shown unwavering support for foreign investors like Grace Roads? What safety standards are you taking for Fiji, not being a dumping ground for substandard goods? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ignore the diatribe coming from that side but try and address the substance of their concern. As I have said, I received a lot of reports. I have to say that the Consumer Council of Fiji is doing a wonderful job in monitoring consumption in Fiji. I receive regular reports and updates on every single issue in the country and one of the ones that is of active concern currently is the standard of food, particularly imported food items. We are working together to try and sort out what we need to do, going forward, so that is a concern. Some of the imported goods that are coming in at the moment are in foreign language. No one knows what is coming into the country. I think this was coming in before we came into Government. It could not have just miraculously appeared in the last nine months, so let just keep that in mind if we are trying to throw stones at each other.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1707 Rise in Criminal Activities by Teenagers (Question No. 108/2023) HON. A. T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: With the rise in the number of teenagers found on our streets, loitering, glue sniffing and involved in criminal activities, can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration explain as to how section 8 of the Minor Offences Act 1971 be enforced to address these issues? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for his question which is essentially centred around section 8 of the Minor Offences Act 1971 and how we could use that to deal with loitering on our streets by our young street dwellers. This section of the Act is designed to address situations where individuals including teenagers are found loitering in or near premises or in public places under circumstances that suggest illegal activity or prostitution. While it is essential to enforce this law, Mr. Speaker, we must do so within the framework of the Restore Blue concept which we are now endeavouring to use, which emphasises community oriented, policing accountability and rehabilitation. Now, Mr. Speaker, section 8 of the Minor Offences Act 1971 provides law enforcement authorities with the legal means to address these issues. However, approach to enforcing this section is guided by several key principles and I just want to talk through them very briefly. 1. Community Engagement: Building strong ties between our Police Force and the local communities is crucial. We encourage residence to report incidents and concerns if it allows the Police to work collaboratively with the community to identify and address issued. 2. Youth Centred Approach: When dealing with teenagers involved in loitering potentially legal activities, we take a youth centred approach this means understanding their unique circumstances offering guidance and exploring alternatives to punitive measures whenever possible. 3. Mental Health and Support Services: Recognising that some of these teenagers maybe facing underlying mental health challenges. We are working to ensure that mental health services are available to them and accessible to those in need and early intervention and support are central to this strategy. 4. 5. Rehabilitation and Integration: Our primary goal here is not simply to punish but to rehabilitate and reintegrate these teenagers into society as responsible and productive citizens. We must provide them with educational vocational recreational opportunities to redirect their lives positively. Collaboratory Efforts: Collaboration with relevant Government agencies, Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and community groups is fundamental to this approach by pooling resources and expertise we can address the complex issues surrounding teenagers involved in such activities more reflectively. Mr. Speaker, while enforcing this section as the question suggests over the minor offences in 1971, it has been part of our strategy but the focus goes beyond punitive measures. In the past, what the Fiji Police Force would essentially do is when the boats come around, they send a whole bunch</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1708</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 of Police Officers to gather these street kids and take them away until the boat leaves. Then they, obviously, will find their way back to town. The whole idea here is to involve the community and that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to create a society where police officers work closely with the community, so that they can restore safety and hope, to the lives of these troubled teenagers, ultimately, the hope to break in the cycle of negative behaviours and offering them a brighter future. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a question to the honourable Minister regarding the glue sniffing problem. There was a report given by this Substance Abuse Advisory Council sometimes back about the level of glue sniffing amongst our children and our youth. I am just wondering if there is a plan to bring some law in place to try and control or regulate those who sell, buy and use glue, just to protect our young ones. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that question. The short answer to that is, yes. I know it has been discussed in Cabinet and the Police are not the lead agency in that. The Ministry of Education with our Women and Children are the lead agencies looking after that with Social Welfare. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just elaborate a little bit here. Interestingly enough, I was just talking to the honourable Minister for Education and he was pointing out elements of the question to me. Whilst the issue is dealing with children that are loitering on the streets, these issues are flourishing in our schools - children who come to school from home and go back home. In teenagers, the age suggests the problem which means they are old enough now in doing things that they are doing. It is something that they have acquired over time where they are now producing the outcome of how they have been raised. I have always said, at the end of the day, you can talk about government and laws as much as we can, but when it comes to children and because of our laws and our Constitution, it gives that responsibility to parents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not come here and talk about it because a lot of us do a lot of social work with you, and I am just dealing with the Catholic youth. This last weekend, there were 50 youth at my home living with me in Tailevu. These youth talk about these things – their problems and vulnerabilities. It seems societies are not listening to them. It seems as if parents are not listening, so they come down to the street and then the Police have to go and look after them. I remember the issue that honourable Naupoto raised about stray animals. Our society has evolved down that path. I suggested this earlier – there needs to be some spiritual conversation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we are dealing with the lives of our children. We can do as much as raising programmes and supporting it with money, but these are really big fundamental issues. I think with Government and the community together, this is what we are doing. I have got data and statistics here given to me by the Police in the West and Suva on the things that they do and putting them in schools, but these are not the solutions. I was going to read them out today, but they are not. They need empathy, love, care, understanding - these are the big things to deal with. The problem is not only in the streets where they end up, but it breeds at homes and in schools. Until we deal with that and become responsible parents, these things will evolve. They will continue to stay, so I go back to my point earlier - these issues about the problems that we have to do with crime is a solution that needs to evolve from this Parliament, and I would like to initiate that in the future too, Mr. Speaker, Sir, hopefully very soon.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1709 HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a comment to make. Young people are roaming our streets for various reasons – some for various reasons, some for their personal satisfaction, some are earning money for their families, some are there for love, for empathy and for good friendship that they do not find in their homes. I remember a few weeks ago, the honourable Minister for Women proposed the banning of pornography in Fiji. If it has to start from this Parliament, then we have to start now. MR. SPEAKER.- May I add to that, honourable Members. I have come across cases in my village of certain delinquents who have been disowned, not so much by their parents, but by their respective mataqalis. So, if anything happens it is not the parent that is answerable, it is the mataqali from which that young child hails from. The mataqali has to answer at the village meeting - what are they doing about that because not only it has brought disrepute to the family but more importantly to the extended family. That is where the vanua comes in. You have suggested, honourable Minister, that it begins from this Parliament. Yes, I would like to echo that perhaps, this could be taken on board to be discussed by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) as they are meeting now. Whoever is going to take that from Parliament to that particular meeting with the Chiefs, we would like to be rest assured in this Parliament that it will be in their good hands to see that it is properly addressed. If you leave it only with the parents, then for sure the problem will still be there. Yellow Ribbon is good, it is doing well, and I was part of the Yellow Ribbon since I was incarcerated in prison. Now, when we meet with the people who have been imprisoned, they call me ‘Old Boy’. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- I thought that should be referred only to people going to boarding schools like Queen Victoria School (QVS), Natabua High School, et cetera. Now, they tell me too that I am an Old Boy. But, again, you have rightly challenged Parliament, honourable Minister, actions need to be taken from here just like the Yellow Ribbon. This is for our young children that are roaming the streets. I almost ran into some with my driver last night. They were sleeping below the bridge at Nabukalou. Probably, they were going across to take their night nap but the way they crossed the street, they do not care whether the vehicle was coming or what. Then I asked the driver, who are these kids? He said, “oh, these are the homeless ones that live below the bridge”. I would like to extend what honourable Ravunawa has stated in his comment, that we need to take ownership of this. Honourable Members, perhaps you may want to discuss this further during your lunch breaks, try and get some things moving in a direction of getting the GCC to discuss this, this is very important. This is our future generation out on the streets now, not only for the GCC but for other interfaith as well. There are other ethnic groups that are involved as well in Fiji. Thank you. MOU with YWAM Ships Aotearoa Limited (Question No.109/2023) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry and the YWAM Ships Aotearoa</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1710</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Limited? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Youth With A Mission (YWAM) Ships Aotearoa Limited is a New Zealand-based NGO that undertakes voluntary social services, including free medical services around New Zealand and some of the Pacific region. With the endorsement of Cabinet, an MOU was signed and activated on Monday, 7 th August, 2023. The term of the MOU is 10 years which will allow the Ministry and the YWAM Ships Aotearoa Limited to work in collaboration in terms of delivering and achieving universal health coverage in hard-to- reach places in the maritime areas. For the information of the honourable Members, the inaugural trip to Fiji by YWAM Ships was last year, 2022m, and this year, we made it official in terms of the MOU on how they will partner with the Ministry of Health in terms of delivering healthcare to our hard-to-reach places, especially in maritime areas. Part of the agreement is the annual schedule plan, implement, monitor and evaluate health services provided in the best interest of the people of Fiji, and to notify the chance of potential conflicts of interest, which may impact on implementation and the outcome of the programme activity and equally manage and share information and public’s findings in collaboration regarding the use of data from the projects. For the make-up of the staff who come on board for this initiative, they are mostly volunteers and medical professionals as well and other professionals that come on board and assist the Ministry of Health and the country as a whole. Last year, they were in Rabi, this year they were in Kadavu and parts of the maritime areas in the Eastern Division. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me first thank the honourable Minister for Health for the update on the question that I raised yesterday. He is providing me with the Situation Report (SITREP) from the Ministry of Health, so I wish to acknowledge the honourable Minister. Thank you, Honourable Minister, for the good work. My simple question is, we appreciate the assistance and, of course, the MOU (SDG-17 is on partnerships) and we need to continue to encourage this but a key area, particularly, learning from our past disasters is health assistance. I just want to ask the Minister, if assistance during disasters as well is part of the MOU or is included in the MOU? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure this Parliament that is also included in the response to disaster relief situation as and when appropriate. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to know from the Minister whether this MOU has the endorsement or the covering of the New Zealand Government in your cooperation or MOU with the Youth With A Mission? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a New Zealand-based registered NGO, but so far it is endorsed by the Government in terms of the works they are doing. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- My question simply is, some of these arrangements are without the support of the National Government of the particular country and I am wondering whether there are provisions that we are aware of, that have the endorsement of the covering of the New Zealand Government? That is my question to the honourable Minister. HON. DR. RATU A. R.

If we allow this question to go through, I believe there will be some breach in terms of procedures of the business of the Parliament because the question is nonsensical in nature, especially Question No. 110/2023(a). We all know that Government does not organise any golf tournaments, so if that is factually incorrect, BNC would not make sense to the follow-up question. The question needs to be re-drafted and brought to Parliament at a later stage because Government does not organise golf tournaments. We know the intention and we would like to get the answers to the questions as well, especially to part (b) and (c) of the question, but Government does not organise such tournament.
