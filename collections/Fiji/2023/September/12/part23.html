<body><h3>ANNEXURE I</h3><h4>ANNEXURE I</h4><p>MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES (Hon. Ratu A. R. Lalabalavu) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 111/2023 is as follows: The ambulance service is an integral part of the whole health service and it connects the people directly to the healthcare, thereby, enhancing our people’s access to health services. In Fiji, we have continued to witness the increasing demand for ambulance services and our ambulance area always on the move to retrieve patients from their homes in the community, or from sites or motor vehicle accidents or other sites where the injured or sick is waiting, or to transfer patients between health facilities. At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in Fiji, ambulances and ambulance services were in high demand, particularly in regions where the outbreak was happening to not only carry COVID-19 patients to and from the isolation facilities, but also attend to patients with other non-COVID medical conditions that also require their transfer to the health facilities. Our ambulances traverse many rugged and rough terrain throughout the country to access our remote communities, such as in the highlands, in the interior of Navosa, Naitasisi and Ra, the rural villages in Tailevu, Macuata and Cakaudrove, and maritime communities with road access such as on the island of Ovalau, and this is critical for our effort to achieve Universal Health Coverage and ensure that no one is left behind in accessing the essential healthcare they need. This is in line with the Government's intent for health service in Fiji, so the ambulances we have are helping us to achieve this mission. At the moment, ambulances are allocated to the eight major Hospitals or cost centres and they are: • CWM Hospital; • Lautoka Hospital; • Tamavua Twomey Hospital; • St. Giles Hospital; • Central Health Services; • Eastern Health Services; • Western Health Services; and • Northern Health Services. For the past six months of the last financial year, a total of $1.7 million was spent on Ambulance Services. Ambulance service is also intimately linked to our retrieval services that is conducted primarily by our Emergency Medicine Physicians but also other specialities in our referral hospitals.</p><p>To maximise the impact of having ambulance services, we have also invested in improving our patient retrieval capabilities through ongoing training for our doctors and nurses in the Emergency Medicine Departments, as well as other clinical departments that provide critical healthcare, place specialists from our referral hospitals at the peripheral health facilities to build capacity and improve diagnosis and management of patients, as well as continue to procure medical equipment and supplies that will support their work. ii.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 112/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services (Ref.
