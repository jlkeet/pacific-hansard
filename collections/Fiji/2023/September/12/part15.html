<body><h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Political Parties Bipartisanship MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed with the Order Paper before us, I would just like to highlight a few things that have happened in this Sitting. I would like to commend both sides of Parliament. It is historical for the Government to allow an urgent motion to be put forward. I have been sitting on the Opposition side for quite sometimes, even as Leader of the Opposition, and we tried so hard to get an urgent motion put through, but it was so difficult. The second thing happened before we took the break for lunch and that was when Government was willing to withdraw something put forward to be considered in Parliament, after pleadings from the Opposition. Sir, this is an important week for you, a special day including that of the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, but this historic moment cannot pass without us making comments. As highlighted by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism on the issue of an urgent motion, we never saw the light of day on that one. Secondly, as aptly put by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Commerce in this august Parliament during one of the earlier sittings, it is now time for bipartisanship. That was echoed in the Business Committee last week by the honourable Opposition Whip when he also pleaded for bipartisanship. That word is quite difficult to try and carry out the true meaning of it because of the laws that exist, the Parliamentary rules that exist. Yes, in the past it was allowed, you can do cross- voting, you can cross the floor but that has all changed. The rules have changed. So many things can be done together - we all put our heads together and try and look for the best way out to help the people who have put us here. That is all I want to say, because I am so proud to be part of these changes that we are seeing. I thank the Government of the day and the Opposition, especially the Leader of the Opposition, for all that has happened. All we just do is pray some more and harder - the best will always be there when we strive for it. Thank you, honourable Members for listening.</p></body>
