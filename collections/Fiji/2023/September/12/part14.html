<body><h3>HERITAGE BILL 2023</h3><h4>HERITAGE BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the – (a) Heritage Bill 2023 be considered by Parliament without delay; 3 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 113/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure III.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1714 Heritage Bill 2023 12 th Sept., 2023 (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 14 th September, 2023, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Fiji became a party to the Convention concerning the protection of world, cultural and national heritage which was adopted in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference in 1972 on the 21 st November, 1990. Fiji, as a State party to the World Heritage Convention, is required under the World Heritage Convention to adopt legislative and administrative provisions to give effect to the World Heritage Convention. Therefore, the Heritage Bill 2023 provides for the domestic application of the World Heritage Convention in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to highlight at this point that in 2016, a Heritage Bill (Bill No. 10 of 2016) was introduced in Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs. Although the Standing Committee then had begun its deliberations on the Bill, there was ultimately no enactment of any such law. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Bill lapsed. In 2021, a Heritage Bill (Bill No. 3 of 2021) was tabled in Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. Extensive consultations were held by the Standing Committee at various locations and communities at site level, Levuka World Heritage Site with various stakeholders in Levuka and at the national level with various government agencies and at the community level, with communities both in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Bill also lapsed. It is evident that the intention to bring forth and pass a law specifically dedicated to advance Fiji’s protection of national and world heritage site and places has been too long a journey. There is no excuse now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further prolong something that will benefit Fiji, not only for ourselves in this present time and age, but also for our future generations. Fiji being a state member of the World Heritage Convention is also obliged to conform to and implement the Convention and its operational guidelines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I therefore recommend that it would be prudent for this august Parliament to urgently consider the Bill that is tabled before Parliament this morning. There have been consultations with the Department of Heritage, Ministry of Finance and the Office of the Solicitor-General. If I may touch on some of the key aspects of the Bill. The Bill comprises of nine Parts and a Schedule as follows: Part 1 is the Preliminary. Part 2 deals with the Fiji Heritage Council. Part 3 deals with Accounts and Finances. Part 4 deals with the Fiji Register. Part 5 with the Management of Potential World Heritage Place. Part 6 deals with World Heritage Listing. Part 7 deals with Funds for Fiji’s Heritage. Part 8 deals with buffer zones. Part 9 deals with Miscellaneous. The Schedule is the Criteria for the Assessment of Outstanding Universal Value. Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament,</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Heritage Bill 2023 1715 the amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. Clause 2 of the Bill provides the definition of the terms used throughout the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill provides that the objectives of the Bill are to provide for the recognition and management of places having potential and actual world heritage values, establish the Fiji Heritage Council, establish the Fiji Register, provide for the management and operating trust funds for places registered on the Fiji Register, implement Fiji’s obligations under the World Heritage Convention and provide for other matters that are necessary for the administration of the new legislation. Clause 4 of the Bill stipulates that the new legislation will bind the State. Clause 5 of the Bill provides that the department responsible for heritage will administer the new legislation and perform all the functions assigned to it by or under the new legislation. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Council and the composition of the Council. The Council comprises 11 ex-officio members and four other members appointed by the Minister responsible for heritage. The four other members appointed by the Minister may hold office for a term of three years and are eligible for reappointment. The Council may invite a person of expert knowledge to its meetings. Moreover, the Director responsible for heritage is the secretary to the Council. Clause 7 of the Bill provides for the principle that will guide the decisions and functions of the Council. The principles are based on Fiji’s obligations under the World Heritage Convention and the Operation Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Clause 8 of the Bill outlines functions of the Council. The Council is to advise the Minister on matters regarding the recognition and management of places in Fiji having potential and actual world heritage values and Fiji’s obligations under the World Heritage Convention. The Council may also, inter alia, develop policy direction to support Fiji’s obligation under the World Heritage Convention. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 9 of the Bill outlines the procedures for meetings and the governance of the Council. Clause 10 of the Bill provides for the disclosure of any direct or indirect interest by a member of the Council in relation to a matter which may be in conflict with his or her role as a member of the Council. Clause 11 of the Bill prescribes the duties of the secretary to the Council. The Council may require the secretary to administer and facilitate the obligations of the Council under the Bill and to facilitate Fiji’s obligations under the Bill. Clause 12 of the Bill provides indemnity for any act done or meted in good faith by any member of the Council, the Department or public officers employed by the Council or the Department. Clause 13 of the Bill provides for the different sources of funds for the Council. Clause 14 of the Bill provides for the efficient and proper financial management of accounts</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1716 Heritage Bill 2023 12 th Sept., 2023 of the Council and that the auditing of the statement of accounts to be conducted by the Office of the Auditor-General. The certified statement of accounts must be submitted to the Minister and the Minister must present the same to Cabinet within 28 days of receiving the Office of the Auditor- General’s report. Clause 15 of the Bill provides that the Council is required to submit an annual report to the Minister and that on receipt of the annual report, the Minister must present the annual report to Cabinet. Clause 16 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Fiji Register of Potential World Heritage Places in Fiji. The Register lists successful nominations of potential World Heritage Places in Fiji that meets the criteria for nomination set by the Council. Clause 17 of the Bill provides for the requirements and criteria set by the Council regarding any nomination by the public on whether place can become a potential World Heritage place in Fiji. Clause 18 of the Bill provides for the process for determining a nomination for the Register. Clause 19 of the Bill provides that the management of any potential World Heritage place must comply with the standard required by the Council and be undertaken by an approved management authority and according to its management plan. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill also has an Explanatory Note. I endorse the Bill before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of this august Parliament, as rightfully said by the honourable Attorney-General, that this Bill was first referred to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in 2016 and it lapsed and was re-introduced to this august Parliament and then referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights which I used to Chair. We had massive consultations around Fiji. We went to heritage sites, especially Levuka. One of the reasons why it was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights because there were a lot of legalities that we had to actually go through before coming back with a report to this august Parliament. Unfortunately, at that point in time in the last term, due to the time lapse, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was not able to bring back a report to Parliament. One thing that we need to recognize with this particular Bill is, we have to go through the process as defined by UNESCO to pass this particular Bill. One of the major issues that we actually faced when we went to Levuka was the buffer zone. There were buildings that were deteriorating and have been abolished because they were not able to fix it due to some restrictions that were put in place as it is now a World Heritage Site. There are a lot of issues that were faced by the people. Mr. Speaker, when this particular Bill becomes an Act would have one of the biggest Council with 17 members in it. On top of that, none of the members are taxpayers or ratepayers of Levuka. These are some of recommendation that we were working on to bring before Parliament that this Bill needs to be amended. There are four particular departments that are looking after Heritage – the Department of Heritage under the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Fiji National Trust, Fiji Heritage Council and Fiji Museum. This Bill does not define what are the different roles of these particular</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Heritage Bill 2023 1717 four departments and agencies and they were actually overlapping each other. There was no clear cut indication to it. Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that when we are talking about World Heritage Site, all other sites are just on the list, they are not World Heritage Sites, they are National Sites covered by National Trust or Department of Heritage. We are not dealing with humans with those sites, but when it comes to Levuka, we are dealing with humans, we are dealing with investments, we are dealing with businesspeople. The initial building that was there for Fiji Times where the production started, because they were not able to refurbish that particular building, there is no longer a particular building and if this building goes in the form that it is, none of them will be able to renovate their buildings. I urge the Government to send this Bill to the Committee and complete the work that the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights started in 2019. There were issues like COVID when we were not able to consult, there was no interior motive about this. I do understand the importance of bringing this Bill to Parliament because there is UNESCO funding. Unless and until we domesticate our treaties by bringing a particular domestic law, UNESCO will not release that funding. However, what we need to realise, that funding is not much. It will not fix the problem that people in Levuka are facing at the moment. The ratepayers are basically crying and they are requesting. When we were there, they requested us, “please, remove Levuka as a World Heritage Site.” That is the extent, Mr. Speaker. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- We went for the consultation, honourable Attorney-General. Please, this is the time to listen because we are saying what the people of Levuka told us. At that point in time, honourable Bulitavu was also a Member of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Talking in contempt of the Attorney-General:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> That is what I am saying, it needs to go to the Committee. Unless and until I describe what is in the content, we will not understand why it needs to go to the Committee. MR. SPEAKER.- The motion is on Standing Order 51. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Yes. That is what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, it needs to be sent to the Committee rather than having it passed over here because it will have a drastic effect on the people of Levuka.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Send it to the Committee, please.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> With those words, Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend....</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- We can discuss that when we address the substantive motion. That is what you are referring to now:</span> The motion before us is on Standing Order 51.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> I am just explaining, Mr. Speaker, why it needs to be sent to....</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> May I remind you, honourable Whip, the Parliament that we are in now is part of heritage. It is difficult for us here in this Parliament to ask for any extension or renovation</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1718 Heritage Bill 2023 12 th Sept., 2023 works to be undertaken because it is already listed. That is why we need a very clear demarcation of the roles of the Committee that you have said, plus the law. That is why we need to have this before the treaty. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- We have already ratified the treaty, Mr. Speaker. What I am saying is, all those things that you have just mentioned are not part of this Bill. As a previous Chairman, that is what I am saying, that this Bill needs to be amended to bring all those amendments before we can actually pass this Bill. That is all I am saying, Mr. Speaker. Imagine as a Parliament, we face a lot of difficulties trying to do anything to this particular building. Think of what the people of Levuka are actually facing if they have to do renovation to their buildings. We have seen the condition of those buildings, Sir, it cannot go in the form that is presented at this point in time. It needs to be sent to the Committee to be reviewed and brought back to Parliament, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- But we should have discussed this at the Business Committee.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It was not discussed in the Business Committee:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> We never discussed it, so let us move on. Any other honourable Member would like to take the floor on Standing Order 51? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I think what we need to do is realise that this is not anything to do with politics, it is actually to do with Fiji.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Of course:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> We are being facilitative here, honourable Attorney-General.</p><p>Honourable Maharaj was the Chairman of that Committee, Sir. All he is saying is that by the use of Standing Order 51, we are circumventing/circumnavigating some things that are required for the Bill to be full and happy at the end of day. The people of Levuka need to be ensured that we protect them also. I understand also, Mr. Speaker, that there are certain requirements, et cetera that need to be met but it is not about politics here. We are just saying that the Bill had gone through two readings... (Chorus of interjections) HON. F. S. KOYA.- … and fair is fair. It needed after extensive consultations by the Committee and I also stand here as a current Member of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. We will do our utmost with the consent of my Chairman to try and ensure that it is done really quickly because we also want it done, Sir, but let us do it in a way that we cover all the basis and we do not have to keep coming back for an amendment on the Heritage Bill. That is all that is being asked, Sir, and I urge, please think about Fiji and think about our reputation about getting it right. We must get it legally correct and legally right, so we do so. What is paramount here, this is Levuka, you should know, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Of course:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- This is to ensure that Levuka remains a UNESCO World Heritage Site:</span> I am sure my Chair at the Committee will also say this, Sir, that we will do our utmost to try and get this expedited and finished as quickly as possible.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Heritage Bill 2023 1719 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Vinaka, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a brief contribution to the Bill under Standing Order 51. There is nothing urgent in the Bill. The Bill was about to go to third reading, it was in the Committee and it went back to the Ministry, given the advice by the Solicitor- General that the current form of the Bill, given some issues that came up during our discussion with the drafters at that time and one was the composition of the Council where people in Levuka wanted to be part of the Council. The other issue was the penalties that came with those who breached if they wanted to renovate their buildings in Levuka - the penalties were too high. Those were some of the issues that came from the residents in Levuka, and that is why we had to go back to protect those in Levuka. But again, I will urge the honourable Attorney-General, given the dissolution of the last Parliament, the Bill lapsed but there is still pending work in the Committee. I thought this particular Bill would have been reinstated when Parliament convened so that it could be referred to the Committee, at least for the next sitting. We will have to check the current form of what the honourable Attorney-General had tabled in Parliament today, with whatever work is pending, and bring it back to Parliament with the relevant report. The work that was done then plus the current changes that we have not seen but are in here to be tabled in together, so that Parliament would be in a better position to go into the third reading on this particular Bill before we pass. There is nothing urgent here and we submit that this Bill be withdrawn and brought back with the right procedures, because we are just domesticating an international Treaty. It has a bearing in the next motion too on the International Fisheries one where you will need to do domestication. It also has bearing on one of the Bills that he had tabled under Standing Order 51, on the removal of the corruption jurisdiction of the High Court, which is also part of the domestication of an international Convention that Fiji had ratified. These are the domestic parts, and I would like to urge the honourable Attorney-General to look at this very carefully. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just a request as the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Attorney-General might consider, that this be referred back to the Committee and brought back in another session, so that we can iron out the issues that have been brought up. It is just a request. MR. SPEAKER.- They have put forward a request, honourable Member. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we are listening from this side. For your information too, I was in Levuka for the last months, but let me correct something, there has been a lot of misinformation on this issue for the people in Levuka by the previous Government. The first impression is this, that the whole of Ovalau is covered under heritage but no, it is not. Secondly, you can paint the town, but there is a process. You can dismantle, but there is a process. However, we agree that through ventilation of this Bill through the Committee, we want to see that it comes in a good shape and caters for all the inaccuracies that was there before. Therefore, we will withdraw the Bill under Standing Order 51. (Withdrawal of Heritage Bill 2023) MR. SPEAKER.- Finally, there is bipartisan. Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.39 p.m.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1720</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 2.48 p.m.</p></body>
