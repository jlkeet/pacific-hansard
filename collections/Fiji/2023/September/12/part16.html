<body><h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3><h4>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, before I move my motion, I just wish to share some comments and to reciprocate your kind comments about how we are carrying on in Parliament. As the saying goes, Sir, “Everything rises and falls with leadership”, we believe Sir, under your able leadership as the Speaker of Parliament, we are able to foster this new bipartisanship that we are experiencing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That under Standing Order 6, that so much of Standing Order 130(2) to (4) be suspended so as to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to move his motion on the approval of Treaties without referring them to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>1721 HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji played a pivotal role at the 12 th Ministerial Conference last year in getting an Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (AFS) through the World Trade Organization (WTO) acting as lead spokesperson for Pacific Group and the ACP. The Agreement is, however, only the first step in securing meaningful disciplines on fisheries subsidies. Fiji is accordingly one of the proponents of the second wave of the negotiations that is currently taking place in the WTO. In order to maintain its role as a leadership and maximise its ability to influence negotiations, Fiji needs to show commitment to securing strong disciplines on fisheries subsidies through prompting, notifying its acceptance of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies to the WTO members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far, all the big subsiding nations have ratified the WTOAFS including China, the EU and the US. Fiji will, however, be the first Pacific WTO member to do so. In doing so, Fiji will be setting an example to the rest of the Pacific WTO members and to the rest of the WTO membership on the importance of disciplining harmful fisheries subsidies and maintaining healthy fish stocks. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been the only Pacific Island country that was invited and joined the 14 member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) for prosperity which was launched in May 2022. Negotiations commenced after the Ministers agreed to the scope in November last year and are proceeding with an extremely fast pace. In May this year, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Trade Ministers agreed and concluded one out of four pillars of IPEF called the Supply Chain Pillar. This was a remarkable achievement and as we will hear, the Agreement will be beneficial to Fiji in building resilient international supply chains. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the goal for IPEF members is to conclude negotiations on all the pillars by November 2023. The signing of all the pillars of the IPEF is expected to take place in November. Fiji being the only Pacific Island nation participating in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, needs to demonstrate commitment to the IPEF members to capitalise on the multifarious benefits that come within part of IPEF. It is important that we demonstrate our commitment by ratifying the supply chain agreement to ensure that we remain on the path of concluding the negotiations on the rest of the three pillars and that is Trade, Clean Economy and Fair Economy by November 2023. Just to put clarity honourable Members, there has been precedence set before when the previous government moved in Parliament for the ratification of the Paris Agreement on 12 th February, 2016 without referring it to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence because it needed some urgent attention on Fiji’s part. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those pertinent issues and points in perspective, I urge all honourable Members to support this Suspension Motion to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to move his motions on the approval of the Treaties without referring them to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your very wise comments earlier on. I think what needs to be said also is that these two particular Treaties before us are not about politics but about Fiji, and we understand that. Right at the outset, let me say from our side that we have no objections to the motion before Parliament which is asking that Standing Order 130 (2) and (4) is suspended - we do not have a problem with that. Sir, I would not go into the two particular Treaties now but when it is taken up by the honourable Attorney-General we will have a few words to say. But as I said earlier, Sir, in the spirit</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>1722 Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 12 th Sept., 2023 of bipartisanship, this is about Fijians and Fiji’s future and our future generations, we do not have a problem. I wholeheartedly agree with the suspension. Thank you. HON. J. USAMATE.- I would like to thank you also for the comments that you made about the way we have conducted ourselves. I would just like to confirm that we are fully in agreement with this particular motion, but as the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament has said, there is a precedent because it was related to the Paris Agreement which was one of the most important ever agreements that we were involved in. Fiji was at the very heart of all the things that we were pushing for, especially for the Small Island States and the oceans agenda. For issues like this where there was an urgent need for us to be able to push through things quickly, this side of Parliament is prepared to be able to use those fast-track options. There is a sensible argument that I was using earlier on in terms of the use of Standing Order 51 when there are adequate and important issues and there are some urgent things that need to be done, we will be prepared to look at and agreed with that. In this particular issue that has happened, we will wholeheartedly agree with this motion of fast-tracking the process for getting these two treaties in line because they bring a lot of benefits to our country. It also keeps our role as well as the pre-eminent countries in other parts of the world. Also on that note, I notice that there is one other Convention that has been pushed through by the Committee - the Budapest Convention. This was the Convention on Cybercrime and the Committee had already gone through all the stages. It was tabled in the last Parliament Sitting with the recommendation that Fiji ratifies the Convention. I think the honourable Attorney-General was to move a motion in Parliament that Fiji ratifies this, but a few months have passed, and we hope that the honourable Attorney-General and Government will look to moving that particular Convention through. So, those are the words that I have, Sir. We fully support the motion before us. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- I think it is just left to me to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the Members on the other side of Parliament for coming together to agree as a Parliament, and as Members of Parliament, on the suspension motion so we can discuss the two Treaties before us, so I thank them. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
