<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES (Hon. Ratu A. R. Lalabalavu) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 112/2023 is as follows: There have been a total of 417 resignations for doctors, nurses and Allied Health Workers in the past 16 months. A summary of the resignations is as follows: • • • 326 Nurses; 54 Medical Officers; and 37 Allied Heath Workers that include five Dieticians, six Environmental Health Officers, 11 Laboratory Technicians, 12 Medical Imaging Technologists and three Physiotherapists. These attrition numbers are due to many pull and push factors that include emigration, the search for greener pastures, education, family welfare, higher salaries and aggressive recruitment techniques by overseas recruitment agencies and local private hospitals. As I have earlier mentioned in one of my parliamentary Statements, these losses impact our ability to deliver quality services and also increases the burden for those who remain with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. In recognising that we are losing experienced personnel, the Ministry has also pursued capacity building for its current workforce with the support of central agencies of Government and supplemented by our development partners. The in-service training for Medical Officers have ensured that our doctors are upskilled and updated in knowledge, skills and competencies, while attaining post-graduate qualification. For the 2023 academic year, the Australian Government Pacific Scholarship for Midwifery sponsored 20 registered nurses through its in-service training budget. As such, a total of 40 registered nurses are expected to graduate as midwives at the end of the 2023 academic year and they will be formally recruited in 2024. For doctors, a total of 150 Medical Interns were recruited in January of this year, while 80 Medical Officers (MOs) have been recruited as of today, with the remaining to be recruited as soon as they complete their internship. For Oral Health Practitioners, a total of 205 Oral Health Practitioners with another 25 to be recruited in the last financial year, bringing the total to 230. For Allied Health Workers such as Dieticians, Physiotherapists, Pharmacists, Medical Imaging Technologists, Laboratory Assistants and Environmental Health Officers and Biomedical</p><p>Technicians, 558 of the 717 positions have been filled through an ongoing recruitment process and 87 more posts were processed during the last financial year. iv.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 113/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration (Ref.
