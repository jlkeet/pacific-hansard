TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to move that Parliament approves that Fiji accedes to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (WTOAFS).</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1723 Mr. Speaker, Sir, WTO which provides the framework for multilateral trading system has faced considerable pressure in providing a stable and predictable trading system in recent years. It has struggled to deliver tangible initiatives that would enhance international trade and reinvigorate a weak global economy. The lack of agreement at the multilateral level in the WTO has led to a rapid growth in the number of bilateral or Regional Free Trade Agreement across the Globe and rising numbers of non- tariff barriers. Both these developments affect the ability of developing countries to integrate smoothly due to the global economy. There is a bright spot in this rather desolate landscape. In 2022, one of the major successes of the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) was that WTO Member States had agreed to conclude the negotiations on the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies after 21 years. This was only the second time the Ministers have agreed to formalize the Agreement since the founding of the WTO in 1995. The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (AFS) is the first WTO agreement to environmental sustainability as its objectives and is a significant step towards ensuring the oceans sustainability. It will begin to tackle one of the key drivers of overfishing by curtailing harmful subsidies. Fisheries Subsidies are payments made by nations to commercial fishing operators to keep those businesses profitable. According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization 2022 State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture Report, 35 percent of fish stocks worldwide are exploited beyond sustainable levels and over 90 percent are exploited at or beyond sustainable levels. It is further noted that larger developing countries are paying USD22 billion a year in harmful subsidies that drive overfishing. These subsidies primarily go to industrial fishing fleets to artificially lower fuel and vessel construction cost while enabling them to catch more fish by fishing further outward sea and for longer periods of time. Large amounts of fisheries subsidies are provided by large fishing nations such as China, Taiwan, Japan and the European Union. To their fishing industries, this include fuel support, vessel construction support and operational cost support. These subsidies enable the larger vessels, for example the larger purse seiners that are able to extract large amounts of fish out from their exclusive economic zone, the high seas or other countries EEZ. In the Pacific, massive subsidies provided to distant water fishing fleets prevent the development of our own fisheries industries and utilization of our own resources. Mr. Speaker Sir, fishing subsidies, if not disciplined, will contribute to over-fishing, including Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in our waters, thus leading to both environmental and economic harm and irreversible depletion of fish stock for the Pacific. The IUU fishing is a real challenge for the Pacific region. In the 2021 Report by the Forum Fisheries Agency, estimated that between the period of 2017 and 2019, the estimated value of catching volume IUU fishing amounted to USD330 million. It is noteworthy that the Western and Central Pacific region have healthy tuna stocks and accounts for 54 percent of the global tuna catch. Therefore, it is vitally important that the region protects its resources for the current and future generations. Mr. Speaker Sir, the AFS prohibits three types of subsidies, the first is the IUU fishing – Article 3. When a coastal State such as Fiji or Regional Fisheries Management Organisation or arrangement such as the Western and Central Fisheries Commission fight vessels guilty of IUU, this</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>1724 Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 12 th Sept., 2023 article will require the subsidizing members to temporarily withdraw the subsidy from the vessel or operator. The second type is the fishing of overfished stocks under Article 4. The Article prohibits all subsidies for fishing and fishing-related activities in the fishing zones recognises overfished. This is until measures are implemented to review the relevant fish stock. Overfish stock means a population of fish that is too low and cannot support a large amount of fishing. The prohibition of granting or maintaining subsidies applies equally to domestic and foreign vessels fishing and overfish stock. It will also apply in all fisheries within Fiji’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) including small local fisheries, provide the area is deemed overfish. It is important to note that the Pacific has well-managed fish stock. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third type of subsidy is fishing in high regulated high seas (Article 5). This article prohibits subsidies for unregulated fishing and fishing-related activities on the high seas which are not under the jurisdiction of any coastal nation. This is fishing outside of the EEZ and outside the competence of any Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RMFO) such as the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. The implementation of Articles 3 to 5 may require small legislative changes and modification of some existing subsidies. The establishment of the WTO Fisheries Funding Mechanism under Article 7 is an initiative that was announced at the conclusion of the agreement on fisheries subsidies offer some support to WTO members’ efforts in implementing the Economic Framework Supply (EFS). More importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, members have a broad set of notification and transparency requirements under Article 8. The WTO recognises that the implementation of the partial agreement including its notification will post challenges for some developing countries. Article 9 of the EFS contains provision that established a permanent committee on fisheries subsidies of the WTO and will oversee the overall implementation of the agreement. Article 10 further outlines that the EFS is subject to dispute settlement provisions of the WTO. Furthermore, Article 12 contains the termination clause for the agreement. The EFS will become null and void after entering into force if no progress is made in the second wave negotiations within four years. What is the way forward for Fiji? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the EFS only partially delivers the mandate of SDG 14.6, that is, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies and MC12. It will nevertheless have a positive effect on the sustainability of marine fish. Over the years, Fiji has been a strong advocate for international disciplines on fisheries subsidies in multiple international forum. The primary reasons for these position are: 1. 2. 3. 4. To ensure that Fiji Fisheries Resources are sustainably fished and protect the oceans and its resources for future generations in the Pacific; Fiji will be able to develop a domestic fishing industry rather than giving licence to foreign vessels to operate in our waters; Fiji and the Pacific have not been able to compete with operators that receive massive subsidies from their home countries; and finally Fiji will be able to get a better price of fish in the export market whilst the subsidies are removed. Currently, the price of fish in export market is suppressed because of global subsidised fishing</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1725 activity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji played a pivotal role in steering the WTO members to reach agreement in June 2023 by galvanising the support not only from the Pacific but also leading the ACP bloc. Following the success of MC12, the WTO Secretariat members have pursued two separate but related workstreams. The first workstream relates to entry into force and implementation of the new partial agreement. For the partial agreement to enter into force, two-thirds of the members must complete their internal processes such as ratification and deposit the Instruments of Acceptance with WTO. On entry into force, all WTO members who have ratified EFS will be under legal obligation to limit certain subsidies for fishing activity. As of 17 th August, 2023, 14 members have ratified. The majority of the distant water fishing nations and bigger subsidisers of fishing activity have ratified. These include Belize, Canada, China, European Union, Gabon, Iceland, Japan, Nigeria, Seychelles, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine and the United States. The second workstream relates to the second wave of negotiations to which members agree to commence at the time the partial agreement was concluded. It was agreed that if partial agreements entered into force, the negotiations or the comprehensive agreement must be completed within four years. The WTO Secretariat and members have the aim to conclude that the second wave of negotiation by the 13th Ministerial Conference which will be held in February of next year. The Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communication has obtained Cabinet endorsement for the tabling of the WTO AFS when Parliament is in session. The Ministry will continue to undertake a multi-sectoral approach in the follow up negotiation of the second wave and the implementation of the AFS. Even this, Mr. Speaker Sir, it is recommended that Fiji Parliament agree to the ratification of the WTO AFS and the deposit of Instrument of Acceptance to WTO. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor since it is now open for debate on the motion, I would like to inform this august Parliament that I have a list here and for the Government side, we have the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications while speakers form the Opposition are honourable Koroilavesau and honourable Koya. So, we shall begin as usual with the Opposition. Therefore, I offer the floor to honourable Koroilavesau. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief in my contribution but at the outset, I would ask all Members of Parliament to support this motion. This is quite significant and very important for Fiji, in its role as the leading Pacific Island nation that all the Pacific Islands look towards to. As you would remember, Mr. Speaker Sir, Fiji led the negotiation with the United States last year on the US Tuna Treaty. Fiji was able to negotiate the term of the funds that the US will give to the Pacific from $21 million to $60 million in a year. Also, we were able to achieve $600 million for the next 10 years and this was seen as Fiji’s leading role to master a strategy and negotiate with international communities. Mr. Speaker Sir, this motion is very delicate and very important for the Pacific, not only for Fiji but if you look at other Pacific Island nations who are very tiny coral islands lying in the middle</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>1726 Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 12 th Sept., 2023 of the ocean, their dependence on tuna and fisheries is huge. If you look at Tuvalu, their fisheries accommodate about 80 percent of the whole annual budget. If you look at Kiribati, about 80 percent of the annual budget is derived from fisheries. For far too long, overseas companies all over the world have come to the Pacific and taken all the fish that belong to our nations without carrying out the normal process of giving them a fair return. The Treaty basically is a lifeline for smaller islands. Fiji is not very critical because it has other avenues it collects its revenue from and provides budget supplementary for its budget year. But for other island nations who look towards Fiji to be the mentor and the leader in spearheading the issues that are important to the island nations, I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to support the motion. The technical aspects, I think the honourable Attorney-General has highlighted the details. Honourable Koya will contribute towards the negotiations he led at the WTO during his term when we negotiated the terms and conditions of this Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, before I take this opportunity to contribute to the motion before Parliament, I would like to thank my predecessor for his hard work in taking the Ministry of Fisheries to a level before I took Office. Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to contribute to the motion that is before this august Chamber and I wish to extend my sincere gratitude. Mr. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, could you just clarify that sentence that you have just said, you just began taking office this afternoon?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Sorry, Sir, yes, before.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr. SPEAKER.- I am sorry to be raising these kinds of issues because I will take every word that comes from you:</span> Carry on now, honourable Minister. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Sir, I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to the honourable Minister, the Permanent Secretary for Trade and Senior Government Officials who have been involved in the ongoing negotiations in this space. The current negotiation on this is vital for further developing our nation’s fisheries and ensuring sustainable practices are upheld. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make the Ministry’s position clear, that it does not encourage distant water fishing nations that are heavily subsidised and provide heavy presence fish stocks in the areas beyond the national jurisdiction. Distant water fishing nations are those engaged in overfishing, crowding out the market and as such, there is a drop in the market prices. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry seeks the consideration of the following in the second wave of negotiations. A Small Island Developing State with development aspirations, our domestic fleet that are flagged in Fiji and fishing in our EEZ should be allowed to fish in the BBNJ high seas, provided we set precursor measures and practice, such as implementing a licence cap and limit on the total boats deployed. This removes the notion that we are a country that have first flown our flags of convince. Our domestic fleet is challenged with high operational costs and more importantly, aged vessels, which is limiting them from accessing fish in high seas. It is, therefore, crucial that Parliament supports the ensuing finance facilities, subsidised at national level are provided to cushion this cost. As we are progressing in meeting our development aspirations in small island developing</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1727 States concept in the Pacific, it is different from what is adopted in the Caribbean and others. The Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry recognises the need to stand together during the negotiation process, but our desire must always be centred on developing our domestic fleet, noting there is only a small number of fleet and the national sourcing of subsidies is the variance. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry will continue to render its support to the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Micro Enterprises and Communications for the remaining negotiation. We, therefore, fully support the motion but for the ratification process. Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to provide some input on the motion at hand. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, what everyone in Parliament must realise is how important this is to Fiji. As has been mentioned earlier on that in the history of the Word Trade Organization (WTO) and I think its inception was in 1995, this is only a second occasion in which agreement has been reached. This is after day and night negotiations and so many things have happened over so many ministerial conferences, it was virtually destined for the dustheap again. We have been at loggerheads for many years to try and get this done, but we got it done. What to me, Sir, as a Fijian is an extremely proud moment is that these negotiations and this Agreement at the forefront of it was led by Fiji and we managed to convince some of the other developing nations to do it. This is why it has actually been done in twofold. This particular Agreement and I think it is good to hear it - the rest of Fiji, it will prohibit the subsidies that are given by the larger nations and those subsidies basically enables Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, fishing of overhead stocks and fishing of unmanaged stocks. Mr. Speaker, just to put it into perspective, developed countries are actually paying about $22 billion a year on subsidies that actually drive this overfishing. Please, remember something we actually spoke about before - we control some of the largest oceans, but we have always had the smallest voice. But we use that at the negotiations to say, “no more, it is not going to happen, we must have a say”. We led a delegation, and we were asked to lead the talks in the Green Room on behalf of the Africans, the Caribbeans and us, as a Pacific, and we, as a nation, won this over. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these subsidies primarily go towards industrial fishing fleets that larger nations have, and it artificially lowers the fuel and other costs of these fleets to enable them to catch more fish further out to sea. Mr. Speaker, if these subsidies are not disciplined, they will obviously contribute to this overfishing, and it is a huge problem including IUU fishing in our waters. Because we played such a pivotal role in this WTO to get this particular Agreement, we made sure that there was a hook left in, Sir, and there are two things that must happen. First of all, for this partial Agreement to enter into force, two-thirds of the members of the WTO must complete their internal processes, exactly what we are doing now. They must complete their internal processes, such as ratification. That is why it is imperative that we do it, this is about Fiji, Sir, and then we must deposit it into the Instrument of Acceptance. On the entry into force of that particular Agreement, Sir, of which 41 members have actually ratified already, the other part kicks in - the clock starts ticking because we put a proviso in there. Remember this, Sir, we were being bullied by some of the larger nations. We put a clock in there that says the minute this thing is ratified, you have got the one-third, you have got four years within which to complete the rest of the Agreement, otherwise everything falls apart. That was the only</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>1728 Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 12 th Sept., 2023 way we could actually get them to agree. Mr. Speaker, this is a positive stand. As I have said, this is only the second time since the founding of WTO in 1995 that they have managed to come to some agreement. Fiji’s fishing resources are sustainably fished, that is what we were after, so that the oceans and our resources are there for our future generations. We will also, Mr. Speaker, be able to get a better price for our fish in the export market once the subsidies have been removed. Currently, the price with respect to fish in the export market is suppressed because of global subsidised fishing activities. This particular Agreement prohibits three things: • • • IUU fishing; fishing of overfished stocks; and fishing on unregulated high seas. A lot of negotiations have gone on and there has been tremendous amount of negotiations with the Ministry of Fisheries and our former Minister actually knows that too. A lot of hard work has gone into that and we have a fantastic team at both Ministries that we should take our hats off to for having done such a wonderful job. Those civil servants worked day and night to get this done without any sleep or any food, might I add, to continue and finish those negotiations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, briefly again, there are no financial implications on this particular Treaty but, on the good side of it, we will get targeted assistance for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and also for developing nations in implementing the disciplines under the Agreement. We do get assistance for it. There is actually a WTO fisheries funding mechanism which will exist, and this was announced at the conclusion of the Agreement initially. The way forward, Mr. Speaker, as mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General is that we must do this as quickly as possible because we only have four years to negotiate. I am not sure if all of you know this, but the honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications will know that trade negotiators take a long time to get any agreement done. So, four years also, we purposefully put that four years in so that the bigger nations could not drag it along. Those that are giving subsidies could not drag it along for the next 20 years. It is very important that we start and get the clock ticking already on this. We have been very strongly involved in it, as a matter of fact, we have led the Pacific on it. Pacific Island Countries are completely in support of what we have done, they appreciate all the assistance given by Fiji and the Pacific Island Forum also, with all of these. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from what I understand also from honourable Minister, the intention is to deposit this particular Acceptance in October 2023, again, this is another reason why we are in total agreement with getting it done as quickly as possible. Mr. Speaker, as I say, please, to all the honourable Members, this is something very historical for Fiji, it has never been done and I very proudly say this, that we were right in the leadership triangle with respect to getting this done at the helm of it and it is important that we complete it because I can tell you right now and I am sure the honourable Minister will tell you, Fiji’s name at the WTO stands tall because of all of these. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am going to be very brief. I know the honourable Members on the other side have contributed very well in terms of laying out the reasons</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1729 behind the urgency for this Treaty to be ratified. In my previous roles as the Professor of Economics and Advisor to trade negotiators in the Pacific, I have attended many long hours of WTO Ministerial Meetings, and the two most contentious issues on the table most of the time were fisheries subsidies and agricultural subsidies. The Friends of Fish (FoFs), a group of countries which included Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Columbia, Iceland, Ecuador, Norway, Pakistan and USA, there have had these very strong arguments about the harmful impacts of subsidies on issues such as overfishing and depletion of fish stocks. Overfishing now leads to other negative externalities such as disruption in biodiversity and food chains. There are issues about economic efficiency, how large countries and those with large shipping fleets and better economies of scale were able to benefit more. As honourable Koroilavesau said, it is absolutely important for Fiji and the Pacific, especially small island countries which rely on fisheries revenue, tuna revenue but also for countries like Fiji, our emphasis on small scale fisheries operators, particularly coastal fisheries and the need to protect our fisheries stock is always at the back of our minds and those who are concerned about sustainability of these resources over a longer period of time - the Concept of Global Commons, when we talk about fisheries subsidies because it sort of transcends beyond a particular region and a country. So, what happens in one part of the ocean or world can have an impact on other regions as well. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that this is not a complete removal of subsidies generally, I think it is a partial agreement. As honourable Koya said, it goes a long way. In in fact, it is historical - that there is some agreement for a long time, it looks like there was never going to be an agreement on removing these subsidies, like the agriculture subsidy. Having said that, once this is ratified, again, it is a long process. We require two-thirds of the countries around the world to actually ratify this before it comes into effect. So, it is a long way and I think for Fiji, as has been said very clearly, it is very important that we, as a country, ratify this. Parliament and the bipartisan support that we are giving to this Treaty is significant because it is going to send a very, very clear message not only to the world, not only to WTO members, but also to our Pacific neighbours. However, as the honourable Attorney-General and honourable Koya said, when you are looking at US$22 billion in subsidies, those subsidies are actually used or they lead to illegal fishing, overfishing and depletion of stocks, which is very significant. It is not a small amount in the bigger scheme of things. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are doing this, it is important for us, as a Government and as a Parliament, to look at our own national fisheries policies and regulations. I think it is an opportunity for us, as a country, to re-look at that and see where we are in terms of our coastal fisheries, the way in which coastal fisheries are exploited, whether we are getting the appropriate returns and how we can deal with it. These are important discussions that one or two have, going forward. Mr. Speaker, as has been said, this is very important, and I lend my full support to the motion. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the contributors to the debate on the motion in front of us, which is the ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies. Before I begin, let me also thank you for your kind words when we began this afternoon. If you will recall in my Maiden Speech, I had specifically asked for the wisdom of Solomon in this</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>1730 Ratification of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 12 th Sept., 2023 august Parliament and perhaps, the wisdom of Solomon is starting to move around in this Chamber in a big way, Sir. In terms of the debate today or the motion in front of us in terms of the subsidies, I think we should give credit where credit is due and I would like, on behalf of this side of Parliament, to thank in particularly my predecessor to this post, the honourable Koya, and also honourable Koroilavesau for the tremendous work they did in Geneva last year in bringing about the historic Agreement. On behalf of this side of the Chamber, I would like to acknowledge their hard work and also the Government in actually bringing this forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I went to Geneva this year and worked out that we had to ratify WTO Instrument very quickly, as soon as I came back, I called the honourable Koya and said, “Hey, we need to get this sorted, can we do it on a bipartisan basis?” And so here we are, Sir, in this august Parliament, together as a people who are concerned about this country, ratifying this historic Agreement. I will try and be brief, Sir, because I think honourable Koya has covered most of the pertinent issues to do with the Agreement but as we all agree, fisheries is something that permeates not only the Fiji society but the Pacific as a region. It is intertwined with our culture, our day to day living, our livelihood and our survival. The Pacific, the Western and Central Pacific, accounts for more than half of the tuna stocks harvested in the world. Approximately, 60 percent of the stock is harvested from the EEZ of the Pacific countries. As custodians of the vast ocean, it is our job to ensure that we maintain the long- term sustainability of our resources, food security and the livelihoods of our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been a strong advocate for international disciplines on fisheries subsidies in the multiple international fora. The primary reasons for this position are: • • • • to ensure that Fiji’s fisheries resources are sustainably fished and protect the oceans and its resources, as the honourable Koya said, for future generations in the Pacific. Fiji will be able to develop a domestic fishing industry, correctly alluded to by honourable Professor Prasad. Rather than giving licences to foreign vessels to operate in our waters, Fiji and the Pacific have not been able to compete with the operators that are subsidised by their countries to operate at low operating costs in our waters. Fiji will be able to get a better price for fish in the export market once the subsidies are removed. Currently, the price of fish in export markets is suppressed because of the global subsidised fishing activity. In this regard, we need multilateral rules to support regional fisheries management efforts and contribute to the 2050 strategy for the Blue Continent which has been endorsed by the Pacific Leaders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement agreed to at the 12 th WTO Ministerial Conference or as we would like to call it MC12 as part of the Ministerial Outcomes was a historic achievement after 20 years of all talk and no agreement. It was an Agreement that Fiji had a major influence in, in delivering. The current Agreement focuses on two disciplines, that is, subsidies to IUU Fishing and subsidies to overfished stock. It does not limit, at this stage, subsidies that contribute to overcapacity</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1731 and overfishing and does not provide special and differential treatment for developing countries such as Fiji. That is the purpose of the second wave of this Agreement that has been mentioned by honourable Koya. We also have within the Agreement a water-tight mandate to negotiate a comprehensive agreement or else the whole Agreement terminates in four years. Fijis ratification, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will demonstrate a strong commitment to the WTO membership and would provide the best pathway of leveraging the negotiations on delivery, comprehensive disciplines on subsidies, contributing to overfishing and overcapacity in the manner that meets the UN Sustainable Goals 14.6 or SDG 14.6. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that I personally support the motion before us in this august Parliament and this is truly a historic day for our country. We should all remember this day in the history of Fiji. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I, at this juncture, because of the commitment, dedication and passion of those who bid for us, acknowledge honourable Koya, honourable Koroilavesau and, of course, the previous Government. It is, indeed, a historic day for Fiji and for the Pacific Region and, I, therefore, endorse the motion before Parliament. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
