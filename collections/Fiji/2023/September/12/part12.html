<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h4><p>National Sustainable Tourism Framework HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and people of Fiji; thank you for the opportunity to make a Ministerial Statement on the National Sustainable Tourism Framework. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Sustainable Tourism Framework is a proposed 10 Year Strategy led by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. Essentially, what it intends to do is develop a shared vision for the Fiji Tourism Sector over the next decade. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Coalition Government maintains, we believe in regional prosperity. Recently, the Pacific Tourism Leaders collectively committed to our ambition of a regional tourism sector that supports the wellbeing of Pacific peoples, our cultures and our island and ocean resources. Drawing inspiration from the Pacific and adopting global best practices to the Fiji context, Fiji is embracing principles that reinforce shared Pacific values to preserve the future of Pacific destinations for future generations of a Blue Pacific. Tourism, of course, plays a central role to this prosperity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are taking a two-phase approach on the development of Fiji’s Sustainable Tourism Framework. As I had shared earlier in this Parliament, a private sector led Steering Committee is closely overseeing and contributing to the development of the Framework because we do not want this to be just a Government vision. The Committee consists of key partners, such as the Fiji Hotel and Tourism Association, Fiji Airways, Tourism Fiji, Duavata Sustainable Collective, Society of Fiji Travel Associates, Savusavu and Suncoast Tourism Associations, as well as key development partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the first phase, over the next 12 months, the Ministry, with the support of the International Finance Corporation, held a series of public private dialogues with over 600 people. This was mostly delivered virtually to include stakeholders outside Suva. We covered topics such as private sector sustainability and greening, respectful and equitable</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1690</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 workplaces; tourism as a preferred employer; financial solutions for micro, small and medium enterprises; public infrastructure; sectoral linkages; product and experience development, growth of Airbnb; cruise market; and tourism entrepreneurship. We have held focussed group discussions with key Government agencies on the visitor economy, conservation tourism, agri-tourism, culture, community-based tourism, et cetera, and we have more. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also seeking the views of the broader public through an online survey and are inviting written submissions. Whether you are a Government industry, an NGO, academia, civil society, a student or essentially anyone, we want as many views as possible to call it a national framework. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these discussions, along with an assessment on the current status of the Fiji Tourism Sector, have resulted in several key priorities to be considered by the National Sustainable Tourism Framework and its accompanying three-year action plan. We want to ascertain where we are now, determining where we want to be, what the challenges are and where the opportunities lie. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on consultations in the first phase, what came out strongly was that tourism stakeholders collectively desire a future in which tourism: • • • • • • actively contributes to fulfilling career and quality employment; continues to add value to the local economy, including communities and the vulnerable; safeguards and promotes cultural heritage; encourages pro-quality investments; ensures equitable returns to indigenous communities; and plays its part in reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate and disaster risks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the future we want for tourism. Looking at the data from April to December 2022, visitors to Fiji contributed $2.9 billion to the economy. The average visitor spent $376 per night, compared to $353 in 2019, and $3,572 per trip up from $3,379 in 2019. So, the demand for Fiji is high with visitors staying longer, spending and doing more, and we want to build on that. Because of this strong performance, we are now looking at an 8 percent economic growth this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to inform the next phase, which is the development of the Framework, we have synthesized various discussions from Phase A into a summary report. This report provides an overview of Phase A of the Framework development, including background research and outcomes from the first set of stakeholder consultations. It also captures the emerging priorities of the industry to be reflected in the Framework. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 11 key topics that are covered, looking at all the discussions we have had on: Improving the policy and regulatory environment. Embedding sustainability across all that we hope to achieve. 1. 2. 3. Visitor economy and its contribution to our national wellbeing. 4. Our different markets. 5. Our asset and experience - creating more diverse operations. 6. Having in place measurable Tourism Standards beyond economic indicators. 7. Financing on investments. 8. Workforce and skills required.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>1691 Environmental, social and cultural sustainability. 9. 10. Enhancing risk management in tourism. 11. Monitoring and evaluation for sustainable tourism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are all critical areas that we want to build and add on to. The report has been shared with the Government Ministries to ensure policy alignment as a basis for further dialogue, because there will be more. Mr. Speaker Sir, I always say that when tourism does well, so does the economy. So, this is an important piece of work that we hope to deliver in the coming months. Over the next four weeks, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation will be conducting broader public and private consultations to inform the Framework. Once again, I urge everyone who is listening to contribute to this national strategy.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank you again for this opportunity to deliver my Ministerial Statement.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. F. S. KOYA.-Mr. Speaker, before I commence, I just want to remind honourable Bainivalu that the Opposition, my old school Natabua, put up a great fight on that. Please, do not forget that - it means a lot to Natabua. Anyways, I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement. Mr. Speaker, this particular Framework was commenced in August 2022, and I am quite happy that consultations are actually continuing so that we can come up with a Framework proper, which is really post-Tourism 2021 Plan that was there earlier. Mr. Speaker, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, this is a 10 Year Framework and it is actually a roadmap to revitalize and enhance our industry. There is a need for all of these, specifically also because the Gold Coast has moved post-COVID - Gold Coast because of the environmental concerns. Now, even more so with what is transpiring with Fukushima, we may need to also start thinking about what needs to be done but, yes, what may happen and what may not happen. Mr. Speaker, there are quite a number of things that are part and parcel of this particular plan that the honourable Minister has mentioned which we are in total agreement with. One of the areas that also need to be seriously look at is the challenges that our Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) face within the industry and how we can always assist them because they form a critical component in the tourism industry. The tourism industry, Mr. Speaker, is actually private sector driven. I am very happy to see that the honourable Minister is engaged with all the private sector and they are part and parcel of this particular plan, because that will take us a long way. He has mentioned about being a preferred employer, I think tourism is a preferred employer in any event in Fiji. One of the things that we also have to look at is the growth of the Airbnb market in Fiji, which is massive. Currently, I think the Airbnb market is completely full, because hotel rooms are full, and this is actually an offshoot from the cruise ship market. There are particular areas within the tourism industry that we sometimes forget and it is something that we can grow, and this is the wellness tourism. We offer such a huge wellness</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1692</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 programme at home, even locally and we do it to ourselves and this is an area of tourism that needs to grow and we need to invite investment in it. Organic tourism is also something that is huge and the reason why I say that, Mr. Speaker, is that I happened to be in Madrid at the UNWTO Conference and there were some awards being given. There were two young gentlemen who had started an online booking which actually only deal with organic tourism and carbon neutral tourism, and they won awards for it. So, people now with the high spin that we are actually always looking at, are thinking, ‘Alright, I want to take my kids to a carbon-neutral resort where I do not leave any carbon footprint’. Honourable Minister of Finance, maybe, that is something that we need to look at with respect to providing incentives, so we invite these incentives to actually come up with these kinds of resorts. People do pay over and above the amount so that they do not, and they teach their children to leave a no carbon behind at the end of the day when they go on holiday and they spend quite a substantial amount of money, so these two guys actually won an award for it. Things like that, we need to pay attention to, and I hope the honourable Minister is (and I am sure he is) regularly in touch with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) with respect to guidance on this because they are the pillar of strength for all of us. The most important part is, this is a public-private dialogue (which is the most important thing) and as I have said, it covers not just the tourism operators, but our MSMEs, et cetera, are part of that as well. Some of our MSMEs have great ideas and one of the most important things is, we must ensure that our tourism industry must continue to be built on the strength of an environmentally sustainable framework so that we leave a good tourism industry behind for our future generations.</p></body>
