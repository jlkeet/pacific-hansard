<body><h3>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFICECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT</h3><p>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament approves that Fiji signs and ratifies the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Supply Chain Agreement.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.:</span> I will provide some background, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is a United States-led initiative that includes Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The IPEF represents 40 percent of the worlds’ GDP and 60 percent of the worlds’ population and more than a third of the worlds’ trade. The IPEF comprises four pillars namely, Trade, Supply Chain, Clean economy, and Fair economy. The four IPEF pillars are independent on their own. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is the first Pacific Island nation and the 14 th country to join the IPEF on 26 th May, 2022. In accepting the invitation to become a founding member, Fiji saw that the US galvanised interest in enhancing sustainable development outcomes, peace and security in the region. Cabinet Decision 48/2023 had endorsed Fiji’s negotiating machinery at the IPEF negotiations and for the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Micro Enterprises and Communications to be responsible for coordinating all four pillars of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) with support from relevant Ministries and agencies.</p><h4>The United States Trade Representative is leading the negotiation on trade pillar and the rest</h4><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>1732 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 12 th Sept., 2023 of the pillars are being led by the US Department of Commerce. The IPEF Pillar 2 – Supply Chain Agreement, builds on from the ministerial statements which was agreed by the Ministers on 9 th September, 2022 at Los Angeles, USA. The negotiations of Pillar 2 – Supply Chain was concluded after four rounds of negotiations and was further endorsed by the IPEF Ministers in Detroit, Michigan. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Supply Chain Agreement has a total of 27 Articles and it outlines the objectives and goals that the IPEF partners aim to achieve in strengthening and securing the supply chain. The Agreement aims to build a collective understanding of significant supply chain risk with each partner identifying and monitoring its own critical sectors and key goods. It seeks to enhance crisis coordination and response during supply chain disruptions, ensuring the timely delivery of affected goods. Emphasis is also placed on benefitting workers and businesses, especially micro, small and medium sized enterprises by promptly addressing disruptions and promptly resilient robust and efficient supply chains. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPEF partners intend to prepare businesses to manage supply chain bottlenecks effectively, therefore, focusing on strengthening supply chain logistics and infrastructure. Additionally, the Agreement aims to foster cooperation, mobilise investment, promote regulatory transparency in sectors and goods, crucial for national security, public health and safety and economic stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Agreement also emphasised the importance of respecting and promoting labour right in supply chains; recognising the vital role of workers in enhancing supply chain resilience. Efforts will be made to ensure that there are sufficient number of skilled workers in critical sectors and production of key goods through upskilling, reskilling, inclusivity and equal access. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Agreement also identifies opportunities for technical assistance and capacity building to strengthen the IPEF member supply chain. Lastly, the Agreement highlights adherence to market principles and minimising market distortions including unnecessary trade restrictions and protection of business confidential information. Furthermore, the Agreement aims to strengthen IPEF supply chains to the establishment of three new IPEF supply chain bodies - the IPEF Supply Chain Council. The Council will foster collaborative effort among IPEF partners to develop sector specific action plans for critical sectors and key goods, and with the goal of enhancing supply chain resilience. The action plan will focus on diversifying sources, infrastructure and workforce development, improving logistics connectivity, facilitating business matching prompting joint research and development, and enhancing trade facilitation. The second body is the IPEF Supply Chain Crisis Response Network. The Network is an emergency communication channel and will enable partners to seek support during supply chain disruptions and facilitate information sharing and collaboration amongst partners during crisis. The network’s purpose is to enable a faster and more effective response that minimises negative impacts of the economies. The IPEF Labour Rights Advisory Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, comprises of government, worker and employee representatives, along with the sub-committee of government representatives which will support the IPEF partners promotion of labour rights in their supply chain. The Board will facilitate sustainable trade and investment and create opportunities for investment businesses that respect labour rights. The Labour Rights Advisory Board also establishes sub-committees for addressing labour rights inconsistencies. The facility is operated by enterprises that are not micro-enterprises which are</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1733 located in the territory of one party but can affect supply chains in the economy of another party. A sub-committee will play a role in encouraging resolution efforts in providing technical assistance if needed. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sub-committee will maintain a public list of unresolved allegations which may be removed from the list if a resolution is reached or after being on the list for at least four years. These bodies, Mr. Speaker Sir, as proposed by the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, will play crucial roles in enhancing supply chain resilience, crisis response, and the promotion of labour rights in the IPEF partner economies. By fostering cooperation joint actions, the Agreement seeks to create a robust and sustainable supply chains that will benefit all participating economies in the Indo-Pacific region. In alignment with the goals of the proposed IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, the United States has committed several initiatives to enhance supply chain, resilience and cooperation amongst the partners. The first is the training symposium. The United States will organise a series of trainings or symposiums focussing on supply chain, monitoring and operations. Experts from each market, will be invited to share best practices in cargo risk assessments and incident response planning, particularly for industries affected by natural disasters and cyber incidents. These efforts aim to help industries recover faster and improve the identification of supply chain bottlenecks and import dependencies. The second one, Mr Speaker Sir, is the IPEF STEM Exchange Programme. The United States will launch a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Exchange Programme to connect early and mid-career professionals from IPEF countries with professional development opportunities in supply chain operations. The third is a fact-finding mission. The Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, will join the President’s Export Council on a fact-finding mission to select IPEF markets to explore potential collaboration and opportunities. The fourth is the trade missions. The Department of Commerce will also lead up to ten trade missions to IPEF markets over the next five years focused on linking American exporters to opportunities in sectors for which IPEF Partners will increase diversification and resilience. The fifth, Mr. Speaker Sir, is the Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs). The United States aims to establish MRAs with IPEF Partners’ Authorized Economic Operator Programmes that currently lack MRAs within the United States Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism Programme (CTPAT). This move will promote similar and secured trade between IPEF partners and the United States. The sixth, Mr. Speaker Sir, is the cooperation on digital shipping. The United States will allow its support for cooperation on digital shipping, including pilot projects with IPEF partners starting with the Port of Singapore. This initiative will enhance efficiency and modern shipping practices. A workshop for cyber-capacity building of ports has already been announced and we are obtaining nominations from FPCL and PFTL. The seventh and the last one, Mr. Speaker, is the feasibility studies and reverse trade missions. The United States will initiate several new feasibility studies and reverse trade missions, which will bring experts from IPEF markets to the United States to meet with leading US exporters. This will support supply chain modernisation in IPEF markets. What is the way forward for Fiji? The Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives, SMEs and Communications will coordinate with the</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>1734</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 whole of government to undertake steps to ensure effective implementation and compliance with the Agreement such as to establish mechanisms, agencies, or departments responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Agreement. These entities will facilitate coordination, monitor progress, and address any challenges that may arise during the implementation process. The Ministry will also ensure domestic alignment and streamlining of policies, laws and regulations. The Ministry will also engage in efforts to promote awareness and benefits of supply- chain agreement among other ministries, businesses, and other stakeholders. The Ministry will also participate in the agreement through institution bodies outlined in section 35 as stated above. The Ministry will also facilitate training and capacity building for relevant government officials, agencies and stakeholders to effectively implement the Agreement. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives, SMEs and Communication have obtained Cabinet endorsement for the tabling of the IPEF Supply-Chain Agreement when Parliament is in session. Given that, it is recommended that Fiji sign and ratify the IPEF Supply-Chain Agreement. MR.
