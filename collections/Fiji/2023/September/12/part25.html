<body><h3>ANNEXURE III</h3><h4>ANNEXURE III</h4><p>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND IMMIGRATION (Hon. P. Tikoduadua) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 113/2023 is as follows: (a) Fijians continue to migrate to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA mainly for employment and study purpose, according to information gathered from departure records. Between 1 st January, 2023 and 31 st August, 2023, Fijians migrated for education/training purpose is around 3,650, approximately 5,552 for employment and 1,946 migrating to traditional peers Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. There is limited information on both, immigration border system and departure records, to ascertain the total number of Fijians travelling abroad for holiday on visitor’s visa. The Immigration Department continues to work on addressing these challenges with development partners and areas that could enhance our systems at our port of entries for both, aerodrome and maritime. (b) Fijians travelled for visiting purpose and have not returned during the period (1 st January, 2023 to 31 st August, 2023) cannot be captured on the border system. The Department will continue to focus on immigration flows and implement relevant policies to address its immigration challenges. Various other indicative data are not fully integrated into the system electronically, thus providing the essential data is difficult since countries of destination process and capture their own visitor’s visa data.
