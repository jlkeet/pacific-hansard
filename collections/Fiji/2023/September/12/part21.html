A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management for the reporting period 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 Annual Report, which was tabled on 29th March, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is responsible for the effective coordination and implementation of the development in Fiji’s rural sector, in line with the national direction of the Government for rural and outer islands development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry aims to promote growth, reduce poverty and address rural to urban drift through the provision of basic social amenities and incentives for increasing incomes from farming and marine resources. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s role is to oversee the overall achievement of its vision which is a better Fiji for all through building the integrated rural development framework for productive, progressive, safe and resilient communities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 reporting periods, Fiji was still recovering from the widespread damage and destruction brought about by TC Winston which was estimated at $2 billion. Despite the TC Winston recovery programmes and the many challenges encountered, the Ministry adjusted positively and continued to implement capital programmes assigned for rural and maritime areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry made a positive improvement in the 2017-2018 performance period with 89 percent budget utilisation compared to 76 percent in the 2016-2017 reporting period. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have a list of speakers who have been identified by the honourable Whips and we have three from the Government and three from the Opposition. For the Opposition, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will lead the batting followed by honourable Pillay and then honourable Usamate. For the Government, it is honourable Ditoka, honourable Kiran and then to be rounded off by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Manoa Kamikamica. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I need to acknowledge the Committee for this Report and I also wish to acknowledge the Ministry for the hard work that they continue to provide for Government and particularly for our people in the rural communities. This is not a Ministry that is, I can say, easy to work in, simply because of the role of looking after disaster as well as part of the services that it provides as highlighted in the Report - the recovery from TC Winston and of course the so many disasters that do strike the country. I will just go very quickly into the recommendations because there are a lot of speakers as well, Sir. On housing, of course, this is an area that we need to look into, we need to provide the best facility for our people particularly those who live in the rural areas. I had highlighted yesterday in the meeting between the office of the Divisional Commissioners, this is one of the extra roles that they play in the Ministry but usually this is the responsibility of the Office and Accommodation Unit that used to be with the Public Service but of course was with CIU in the last few years. It is just the strengthening of the coordination and hopefully the allocation of the funding because the</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 1741 Commissioners do look after the Government quarters and of course Government rented quarters as well to provide for people in the Divisions. On Recommendation 4.3, Sir, I think there are two relocations that are mentioned in the Report - in Nabavatu and, of course, in Dreketi, Qamea. It is very unfortunate, Sir, but I hope that the Government can expedite this so that our people can be provided with the necessary facilities. The Ministry only provides the initial arrangements because the other Ministries particularly in these particular cases, the role of the Ministry of Lands in ensuring the risk assessments are made and it is based on the recommendations that the delays were experienced because the Ministry of Rural Development cannot go ahead with the process of relocation once all the relocation criteria as set out in Fiji’s Relocation Guidelines are met, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 4.5 is very important, the one on water. I would say and listening to the honourable Minister for Infrastructure yesterday, he did mention about the data but most of these data can be collected from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. There is a development unit within the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, and they work very closely with the Ministry of Rural Development because they do all the village profiles. I know that in the last few years we were quite behind in this, but we are thankful that through the payment of the turaga ni koro allowance, this is one of the key expectations out of the turaga ni koro and we hope that the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs will update their village profiles so that we can do the necessary intervention particularly on water and sanitation. This is important because I have read with interest the need to vaccinate the people in Vanua Levu because of typhoid because water projects are related to Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue and Diarrhoea (LTDD) and therefore the coordination. That is why the role of the Ministry in the integrated Rural Development Framework is very critical, Sir, and I hope that all the agencies involved can look at their responsibilities within this and see if projects can be implemented. Hotspots particularly, the Ministry of Health knows it very well. Hotspots are very much related to water and hygiene and therefore the close coordination between the ministries are so important. I thank the Committee once again, Sir, and I know that other speakers will highlight are few areas as raised in the Report, but I do commend the Ministry and of course the Committee for the Report before Parliament. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise this afternoon to contribute to the motion on the Review of the Ministry’s Annual Report for 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. First, I want to thank the Committee for the wonderful work they have done and for everyone involved. I also like to give thanks where it is due to my predecessor, the honourable Leader of the Opposition now for all the work. The wonderful thing about this Report is that it provides some context to us in that we can look back and see where things started and how things happened. In my recent travel to Lomaiviti, that has come very true for me as I linked things together with what I have read in the reports and what I have seen on the ground. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two years that were covered in the Report, witnessed as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the devastating effects of TC Winston. It caused major destruction and despair but one wonderful thing about these kinds of difficulties that hit out nation,</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>1742 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 it brings us together. It calls us to unite. I am sure many of us can think back and see how our young people who are going around saying “stronger than TC Winston”. That kind of united effort, I believe brings us together as a nation as something that we need to build upon going forward. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, another notable progress during this period was the relocation of Tukuraki Village in the interior of the province of Ba. Again, something that I have witnessed going around is the effect of deforestation and the unwise farming methods that has been practised in some parts of Fiji. We have seen, as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, some of the effects around the nation in Qamea as well as in Dreketi and in other areas of Fiji. We see landslides happening because of the deforested ridge lines which is what the Ministry of Forests is advising us not to do. Through careful planning and community engagement, the Tukuraki project was completed so we are very thankful to the previous administration for doing that. I am also delighted to inform this august Parliament that during the same period, another major achievement was the National Humanitarian Policy so again we are thankful for that. I wish to acknowledge members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for receiving senior members of the Ministry to clarify several issues that arose from the two annual reports before Parliament today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst these issues were the maintenance of government quarters, the relocation of the Dreketi Health Centre and Dreketi Primary School, the upgrade of rural community roads, solutions to water problems faced by rural and maritime communities and the review of the National Disaster Management Act. In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry is working very hard to help improve the conditions of Government pool quarters in need of repair. I am pleased to inform Parliament this afternoon Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Quarters Administration Policy has been finalised and will be submitted for Cabinet’s endorsement soon. On the issue of relocation of the Dreketi Health Centre and Dreketi Primary School in Qamea, Cakaudrove, I can confirm that the Geotech surveys for the new relocation sites for both the school and the health centre have been completed. We are now awaiting construction of the new primary school and health centre which will be spearheaded by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the upgrade of rural community roads to assist in water cartage to areas affected by prolonged dry spells in Western Division, the Ministry works closely in partnership with Fiji Roads Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Sugar Industry, Fiji Sugar Corporation, Ministry of Forestry and Fiji Pine Limited to ensure a collaborative effort to address the challenges faced by these communities and improve accessibility. Something that I would like to comment again Sir, and something that I have also observed is that in many of these maritime region, we have these big PWD depots lying idle and also in other rural areas of Fiji. It is something that we would like to use once again I suppose when the PWD comes online to help with the maintenance. I believe, as in the way that governments go, we experiment on some things that we think might work and I believe that doing away with those depots and the way that the FRA worked, did not work for us. That is something that the Ministry will need to review and work on once again, in collaboration with the Ministry of Works, to try and fix the rural roads and the dire need for repairs in many of the areas. I have been to Gau; one half of the island has proper roads and one half of it does not have proper roads. I have heard from those that are on the island that before, those roads used to be well maintained when the PWD depot was in operation.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 1743 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry recognises that water is the basic need and it is also very right for every Fijian to have access to this basic necessity. The Ministry continues to consult with the Ministry of Infrastructure, Water Authority of Fiji and the Mineral Resources Department for permanent water solutions. The Water Authority of Fiji has scoped areas where reliable water sources have been identified. Additionally, the Ministry continues to cart to remote rural and maritime areas affected by dry spells. Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans are also in place to consult with development partners, NGOs and relevant stakeholders to assist areas in the Eastern Division that are usually affected by water shortages. In the 2019 to 2020 financial year, the Ministry signed an MOU with Oceania Water Group for the hiring of its desalination plant to assist in emergency water cartage. Further the Ministry in partnership with UNDP is now assisting in the purchase and installation of desalination plants for maritime communities to assist in prolonged dry spells. A classic example is the water project that we have in Ekubu Village in Vatulele where a desalination plant will be installed and powered by solar. This plant can convert about 3,000 litres of seawater into drinkable water within 24 hours. The project has now been piloted in Yakubu Village and would be replicated in other maritime communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry in partnership with Water Authority of Fiji implemented Ecological Purification Systems (EPS) in areas affected by prolonged dry spells and the absence of safe drinking water. We have installed EPS in the following areas: • Dawasamu Primary School in Tailevu; • Naqia Village in Tailevu; • Naboutini Village in Serua; • Wainilotulevu Village in Namosi; • Tavuki Village in Kadavu; • Natewa Village in Cakaudrove; • Nagadoa Village in Bua; • Nasovatava Village in Nadroga; • Saioko Village in Ra; • Wauosi Village in Navosa; • Naiyaca Village in Nadarivatu; • Nawairabe Village in Navosa; • Waibasaga Village in Navosa; • • • • • Beqa Yanuca Secondary School; Lutu Village, Wainibuka in Naitasiri; Naimasimasi Village in Serua; Nacavanadi Village in Gau; and Few others in Koro, Cakaudrove and Macuata. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the National Disaster Management Act, I am pleased to inform Parliament that the review process has been completed and the Draft Bill is now before the Office of the Solicitor-General for final vetting before tabling to Cabinet and Parliament. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure this august Parliament that the Ministry is committed to improving service delivery and facilitating economic growth through meaningful development programmes that are aimed at reducing poverty and improving livelihood.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>1744 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 On this note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to offer my full support on the motion before Parliament. Thank you and vinaka vakalevu. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to make a contribution to the Report before Parliament. The Standing Committee on Social Affairs has reviewed the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management’s Annual Reports 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. The Report highlights the Ministry’s role in coordinating Government efforts during emergencies and in normal times, particularly in the aftermath of TC Winston. Despite challenges, the Ministry showed improvement in budget utilisation and continues to implement programmes for rural and maritime areas. The reconstruction of the Dreketi Health Centre and Dreketi Primary School has already been alluded to by the honourable Minister and the project is completed. As for the relocation of the 18 homes in the red zone areas, the Ministry has stated that the relocation plan has been developed and is currently being implemented. The Ministry assured the Committee that all necessary measures have been taken to ensure the safety and well-being of the affected communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee enquired about the progress of the Rural Electrification Projects in the maritime areas. The Ministry informed the Committee that significant progress has been made in that regards with a total of 32 Rural Electrification Projects completed during the reporting time. These projects have benefitted numerous communities in the maritime areas, providing them with access to electricity for the first time. The Ministry highlighted the challenges faced in implementing these projects including the difficult terrain and the logistical constraints. However, despite these challenges the Ministry remains committed to the electrification of rural and maritime areas and will continue to work towards achieving this goal. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee raised concerns about the availability and accessibility of clean drinking water in rural and maritime areas. The Ministry informed us that they have implemented various water projects including the construction of rainwater harvesting system and the drilling of boreholes, however, there are still challenges in ensuring a sustainable water supply in some areas, particularly those during periods of drought. The Committee recommends that the Ministry continue to prioritise water supply of projects and explore alternative solutions such as desalination plants to address the issue of water scarcity in rural and maritime areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also on that note, I would like to mention few points in regards to the Balevuto water project. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Health and the honourable Minister for Infrastructure for the efforts put in now. I have been advised that water tanks have been placed in the five schools, that is, Nukuloa Primary, Nukuloa Secondary, Nacaci Hindu School, Naruku Primary and Balevuto Public, and Water Authority has moved in to fill in water from Waiwai Catchment. They have also positioned few water tanks in a few communities, but a lot of work is required in other communities. Some of the schools are also providing bottled water or boiling the water to assist the students. Actually, the communities are afraid to drink the water from the catchment. I would urge the honourable Minister for Infrastructure together with the honourable Minister for Health to visit that area.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 1745 A lot of work has been done in that catchment area, there is a brand new treatment plant constructed and sitting there, but there is a drip treatment that is being done to the water that flows down to the communities - a bit of work is required and then the whole project will be completed. I look forward to the support from the honourable Ministers. With those few words, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the discussion on this Report. Disasters are a fact of life in Fiji. This means that there needs to be a lot of preparation. We all know where the rivers that could flood are, and the slopes that could landslide and we have experienced cyclones from Category 1 to Category 5. Each village used to plan and develop their own disaster risk management where they knew how many elders, people living with disabilities, exits and evacuation centres were and how to use them, but unfortunately, this practice lapsed. In 2016 when TC Winston struck Nayavutoka Village in Nakorotubu Ra, an elderly person and a person living with disability were trapped in their homes and died, as most members of the community ran to save their own lives, once the tidal wave covered the village. We found many similar incidents around the area as Category 5 TC Winston smashed the coastal communities. Having a school at a distance, the community struggled without an evacuation centre and TC Winston showed us the urgent need for planning, evacuation and relief as many families struggled. Around this time of relief from TC Winston, cluster system was introduced. That was the first time I came across it and we discussed it with the consultant. This was different from DISMAC, which has now become NDMO. So former DISMAC was coordinated by the Divisional Commissioners who knew their geographical areas and knew their teams well on the ground. With the cluster system, we saw a term of coordination from Suva with cluster leads from UN agencies or co-led by UN agencies. Their multiple assessment forms developed by different agencies. In one village I visited at that time in the interior of Ra, a turaga ni koro told us he had filled the forms from seven different agencies in one day. We also saw multiple agencies delivering various kits. With limited spaces in the tents, many families expressed frustration that through all forms they were filling they were getting the same kind of kits delivered to them and they had no space to keep it. We realised that this was a painful trial and error being done at a time when remote communities needed urgent assistance. I am sure we can only learn from it. We also saw when clusters were bidding for funds in competition, we saw that the wash cluster raised more money generated for water and toilet systems than the housing cluster - when most of the homes in all those villages were completely destroyed. We visited a village where stand alone flush toilets were built and was not connected to sewerage or water system because this cluster was at work, while families were living in tents. We saw economic project like gardening setup with no watering or backup system when villages set on the coast needed boats and fishing gear to kick start their economic life. These came through clusters and partners who did not understand our communities well enough. All these indicated to us that it is important whether there is a cluster coordination or DISMAC that on the ground, relief efforts should be coordinated through existing mechanisms that allow proper distribution of resources where need is. Assessment should be done with one standardised form through local agencies on the ground and coordinated through DISMAC or with the current NDMO, to disseminate it to each cluster relief agency instead of the other way around. Government has its own machinery through Divisional Commissioners and they should be empowered to lead relief. Under the leadership of the honourable</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>1746 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 Ditoka, we saw that has come back and floods were very well managed through Commissioners without and entourage of Ministers. Various disasters have also shown urgency in positioning of stocks when there is a cyclone warning or flood warning because we know where the impact is expected. It is prudent to have stocks in place and can be mobilised for instant relief. During the period of reporting, we saw after each disaster, there were two weeks of assessment and then relief but by then, many families started dealing with the shock. Food, water and dry goods distribution is crucial when people are in need. Clean water mobilisation takes time and sometimes, the clean water does not come for four to five days and that leads our people to drink dirty water leading to waterborne diseases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during disaster relief it is important that leadership and responders provide care and concern without biases. We have seen the entire Vitogo District suffer post TC Evans and TC Winston. Post TC Evans, relief materials were dropped and picked up again. There was any instruction by the then Government not to provide relief to all communities under the district of Vitogo. They were left to suffer because the leadership did not like the opinion of the late Momo na Tui Vitogo. We saw similar sentiments when we visited Vatulele Island to deliver roofing iron and other supplies post TC Yasa - we had to use Uto ni Yalo because the Government does not take relief materials. Disaster is a time when all hands should be on deck and all partners led by Government should be responding to people most in need. There have been many lessons we can learn from to ensure that during the next disaster season, we are better prepared and better positioned to serve those in urgent need. I support the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank you for your time. HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity. Once again, I would like to thank the Committee. It is a dated report but nevertheless, I was not going to speak but I thought I would share a few things after all. I will just talk about a few things that are in this particular report, in terms of the recommendations that we have, particularly item 4.4 which recommends that the Ministry work in partnership with the Fiji Roads Authority, Ministry of Agriculture and Fiji Sugar Corporation to upgrade rural community roads, this is something that is always needed especially out in the rural and maritime areas. The Minister was talking about what he saw on the Island of Gau and the roads that goes up from Qarani to Nacavanadi is overgrown and that has been an issue. Looking at the status of roads – if you look at the roads around Gau and Koro, they are very different. If you look at the roads in Koro - theroadthat goes around the island and the road that crosses from Nasau down to Nabuna - these roads are well kept. But there is a very big difference in the number of vehicles you will see in Koro, compared to Gau. So, one problem that we have in a lot of outer islands is when you build roads and there is not enough vehicles, the roads tend to get overgrown very quickly, and that is what we see in Gau, Matuku and other areas. Another problem that we also have in a lot of rural roads is the lack of access to good aggregates. If you see the roads that are being built in Kadavu and Ovalau, for a lot of them, the aggregates were coming across from Viti Levu. But what FRA has started to do is to look at quarries in each of these areas. If we go down to Gau close to the village of Vione, they are looking at a good</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 1747 new rock quarry there that will address the needs for Gau. The same thing has been done in Koro, close to the village of Tuatua. When you have these aggregates and you are working in tandem with the suppliers, you are able to fix the roads quickly. I think it is also important for us that when we are looking at keeping roads, we need to have enough vehicles on these roads. I think that is one of the major problems we have in Gau, even for the existing roads that you have, that is a particular problem. This concept of opening up quarries in all of these islands, in Kadavu we have opened up the Kiobo Quarry and the one in Yawe. So, having these aggregates around makes sure that you can have a good supply of material that will allow you to look after your roads. There is one thing that I would like to highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to Recommendation 4.5 about water and I am glad to see that the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs is here. If you look at what happened in Dreketi, Qamea Island where the landslide took place, straight after the village - the village is here, the sea is here, and immediately behind the slope, they have cut down all the trees in that area. They have began to plant immediately behind the village and this is where the landslide took place. I think this is something we might need to consider in terms of looking at landslides, in terms of looking at the quality of the water, to have some sort of standards around those areas. That might be something we can look at in iTaukei Affairs. But the other aspect is water catchment management. I think in Taveuni they talk about the blue line, is it? People are encroaching into these areas where if you cut too much of the trees or you change your agriculture practice, it is going to have an impact on your water, on the quality of water and the volume of water that we have. I agree with the recommendations that are made here - boreholes, rainwater harvesting, self- help projects, water tanks, piped water, but it is also important to manage our water catchment areas well. Make sure that we have trees there. During afternoon tea, we were talking about when we used to drink water from the stream before, even if there are frogs there. You chase them and if the water is flowing, you can still drink that water because it is coming from a forest, the water is clean. So, I think this is also an important aspect that we need to manage well. The last thing that I would like to mention, I congratulate the honourable Minister for bringing the National Disaster Management Act. Work has been going on for a long time and I hope that it gets passed. A lot of the issues that were brought up here by the Assistant Minister and the problems that are faced, I know that the NDMO has been working on that through the cluster system, to try to make sure that there is continuous improvements to the process that they use. On that note, I would like to wish NDMO well as we are moving closer to the cyclone season once again, October/November. We will be having a lot of rain and we hope that all the lessons learnt will allow them to manage these disasters when they do happen so that we can look after the people in this country. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse the recommendations in this Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Usamate and thank you for highlighting to us the problems encountered in Gau. You have built roads, half of it is not used, so maybe the animals are using it. That was the problem with the airport they had in Vadravadra as well. The late Ratu Penaia Ganilau went there, and he was fronted by stray animals roaming around the aerodrome there. That became a problem as well but they do eat dogs in Gau so that is no problem there. I am just kidding in here because we have been sitting for long. (Laughter)</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>1748 Review Report – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2018 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to very briefly support the motion at hand in terms of the review of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 Annual Reports. I must admit that the Report is also outdated, Sir, however, firstly, as a key coordinating agency, we look forward to collaborating closely with the Ministry for Rural Development and Maritime as it continues to fulfil its role in leveraging the resources and engaging multi-stakeholder partnerships needed to expand its efforts towards building a more sustainable and economically diverse rural and maritime communities and economies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that the rural and maritime areas in Fiji constitute a significant portion of the country’s total land area of over 90 percent, and over the past decade, important progress has been made but development gains have also been fragile, which are now undermined by new and emerging interconnected threats, including but not limited to climate change, economic and financial sustainability, the COVID-19 pandemic, unsustainable resource, to name a few. Bridging the development gap between rural and urban areas to a greater extent has never been so much of a cross-cutting issue than it is now. In parallel to the table Report, I would like to acknowledge the hardworking efforts of the ground team and Divisional staff and Executive Management for their relief rehabilitation work that was aimed at the TC Winston of 2016 and 2017. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a collaborative effort on empowering sustainable local livelihoods should be emphasised in this case to address any national key priorities and thematic areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has benefitted from partnering with the Ministry through the roll out of our MSME and Cooperative Development Programmes. They assist us in the implementation of the programmes whether it is in the form of distribution of application forms, applications we receive from them, and they are always ready to assist us. We have seen applicants that come through the Provincial Administrator or District Officers to us. One of the other things, Sir, that we have attempted to do as a Ministry this year is try and encourage collaboration amongst all the Ministries, to ensure that we build a more cohesive approach, particularly when we move into the rural and maritime areas. I am pleased to note that we had our first multi-agency meeting earlier last month, and I look forward to continued collaboration in terms of trying to drive the rural and maritime economy. Sir, before I conclude, I just wish to highlight something that is mentioned in the Standing Committee Report about incomplete projects, such as the refurbishment of Government quarters and the relocation of communities in the red zone. I know that the honourable Minister will fix up all these issues, given that they are legacy issues from the previous Government, to a large extent. I hereby support the motion on the review of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Annual Reports which was tabled on 29 th March, 2023. MR.
