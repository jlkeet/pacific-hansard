<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFICECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK SUPPLY CHAIN AGREEMENT HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again in the same vein as the earlier motion, this is a very important agreement for Fiji. It sets the foundation but may be historically extremely important. There are a lot of things that Fiji will benefit from with respect to this particular agreement. What must be realised, and as pointed out by the honourable Attorney-General, is that, this particular band or group of countries is about 40 percent of the GDP of the whole world. What we, as a country, should put into perspective is that, Fiji is the only small country that is a founder member and to be invited to become the founder member on this particular economic framework is a massive achievement. We are in a phenomenal company of 14 different countries as mentioned: Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam. It just goes to show how powerful we are in international forums to be invited to be at that particular table. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is before us is that we need to get ratification on this also and this is with respect to the prosperity and supply chain as part of the agreement. There has been finalisation of the legal scrub on Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), for this prosperity and supply chain agreement. As we all know, this is actually a regional initiative that commenced in 2022, as mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General. One of the basic things is that it promotes cooperation, stability, prosperity, development and peace within the actual region, but this is going to be the cornerstone for many things to come in many years to come. It is very important. This is one of the very reasons why I took the liberty when the honourable Minister for Trade first stepped into the office, I told him and I said, “Please make sure you do not take your foot off the gas on IPEF, it is an important tool for Fiji.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are intensive negotiations and discussions that have taken place with respect to this, and as I have said, now there are four different pillars on this when you are talking about trade, supply chains and clean and fair economy, et cetera. There are a lot of materials on this that people can read if they want to. But, once again, it is a hugely important tool. It is this particular Supply Chain Agreement that is actually unprecedented with respect to our international effort and it is there to enhance our resilience, efficiency or productivity, sustainability, transparency and diversification all of those things. It actually aims to build a collective understanding of the supply chain risk. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must remember that we have just come out of COVID and we had a whole lot of things wrong that we were not able to deal with. So, as a country, we need to deal with that at that particular level and this is why this particular Agreement will aim to ensure that we foster cooperation, mobilise investments is another thing also transparency in sectors and goods crucial for national security and public health. We may just say these words but when you get down to the nitty-gritty, especially when it comes to public health, national security these are important issues and again also the promotion of labour rights, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is a whole lot attached to this particular Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Also for us, it identifies a lot of opportunities for technical assistance, some of which have already been made available. I might add, this is not just the assistance that is being offered and proffered to us, it is not just by way of government, it is private institutions. Some of the large, large companies out of the</p><p>1736 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 12 th Sept., 2023 United States are actually coming on board offering assistance to our MSMEs, offering assistance to our women. There is a lot that Fiji can benefit from with respect to this particular Agreement. As mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General, this Agreement will also establish three new bodies and those three bodies are the Supply Chain Council, the Supply Chain Crisis Response Network and, again, I say this because we have just come out of COVID and great minds think alike and we are being considered as one of the great minds around the world by having a front and centre seat at these particular bodies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that also stands out is the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Labour Rights Advisory Board which will be formed. Again, this is important, bearing in mind today’s issues that need to be addressed with respect to levy. So for example they will be addressing labour rights inconsistencies at the facilities that are operated by enterprises that are not micro-enterprises but are located in the territory of one party when it can actually affect the supply chain of another country. So, you can see that they are leaving no stone unturned and once again Fiji is at the heart of these discussions and I take my hat off to the entire trade crew that has been heavily involved in this with hours and hours of laborious work that actually take place before it comes to us to get these things ratified. With some of the goals Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the proposed Supply Chain Agreement, again, we are on a timeframe, we need to complete this, if I am correct honourable Minister, in November or late October. There are, as mentioned by honourable Attorney-General, trading symposiums that will be organised by the US and I must add here Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the US is at the forefront and is driving this at breakneck speed. I am sure honourable Minister has had sleepless nights already trying to get these things organised. They are driving this at breakneck speed to ensure that it comes to fruition and completion. There is also something else that is of quite importance that is actually called IPEF STEM Exchange Programme. They are launching a science technology, engineering mathematics exchange programme. This is to be connected to early and mid-career professionals from IPEF countries and these are things that are important to us, it furthers our education, it makes us better. As mentioned also by the United States Secretary for Commerce, Mrs Gina Raimondo, a very very high-powered woman who will also be part and parcel of the fact finding missions that need to happen with all around the IPF countries. So, you can see Mr. Speaker, Sir, that with respect to trade missions also, there will be trade missions that are coming in and out of Fiji. You can see that there is a lot that we will benefit from out of this. Again, we go there not only to push our own position, it is also we are Pacific-minded when we do things, so we ensure that it is done properly so that all our Pacific Island neighbours stand to benefit out of this. With the conclusion of the negotiations I understand, Mr. Speaker, describing as I said had been completed. The final text of the agreement has been prepared. They are simply waiting for us to ratify what needs to be done as a way forward to complete this agreement and get there. Again, a very historical moment for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, and once its implemented, we stand to benefit with the numerous benefits and this historic international agreement that unites 14 very powerful nations around the world and across the Indo-Pacific region and basically so that we can focus on creating reliable and secure supply chains. Again, all of these stem from the difficulties that we all faced post-COVID and a lot of</p><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1737 work is going on and I commend the team that had actually done so much work on it already having been part of this from day one. We wholeheartedly support this motion before Parliament. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thank the honourable Koya for his contributions. The IPEF Agreement is let me say is unusual in a lot of respects and I will try and explain why very quickly. Firstly, it has been targeted to be achieved in record type. Ordinarily economic cooperation or trade agreements can take five years sometimes 10 years. This has been done at breakneck speed. We signed as founding member in May last year in 2022 and the expectations are that by November, we would have completed all pillars if not substantively all three, with some sections left. The second thing about this agreement, Sir, which I have noticed is not only the agreement is just about a government multilateral agreement between governments, it is actually trying to reach into the private sectors of each country and then attempting to connect them up as well. So, from that perspective, it is a lot more deeper and a lot more powerful and that is why as you have noticed, there is already what we could consider early harvest benefits that were itemised quite in detail by the honourable Attorney-General and of course, spearheaded by the Secretary for Commerce to President Biden’s Cabinet, Her Excellency Gina Raimondo. She is very committed to work with all parties too IPEF and particularly with Fiji to see how we can harvest the benefits. Another point to share with the Members of this august Parliament is the level of assistance that has been already offered to try and put this together. As we know, a small country like ours is always constrained with resources, but we have certainly had assistance from some of our very close partners, New Zealand has assisted us, UN as well has assisted us as well as Australia that has a budget of $20 million that will assist in building the necessary structures but to ensure that the IPEF once signed by the partners is brought into effect and embedded very well into Fiji. If anything, Sir, the successful conclusion of the second pillar or the Supply Chain Agreement as mentioned by honourable Koya is a significant milestone for Fiji. It represents the strengthening of economic ties across the Indo Pacific Region to no less than 40 percent of global Gross Domestic Product. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement is designed to enable IPEF members to work together collaboratively to make supply chains for resilient, efficient, transparent, diversified, secure, including through information exchange, sharing of best practices, business matchmaking, collective response to disruptions and supporting labour rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this agreement facilitates co-operation amongst IPEF members and fosters an environment that promotes competitiveness while reducing costs for consumers. The Supply Chain Agreement, it goes without saying, holds tremendous potential for the IPEF region and particularly for Fiji. Certainly, our Ministry is motivated to ensure that we extract maximum benefit from this transformative arrangement. A robust and resilient supply chain network will bolster our economy, help our people and build capacity to respond to unforeseen disruptions and challenges. The IPEF supply agreement reflects the spirit of collaboration and shared prosperity amongst IPEF members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPEF members have committed to various initiatives to enhance the supply chain resilience and cooperation amongst the IPEF region such as mentioned before - trainings, symposiums, trade missions, Pacific Focus Reverse Mission and STEM Exchange programme which will be a very great interest to the honourable Minister for Education.</p><p>1738 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 12 th Sept., 2023 The IPEF parties also aim to establish a mutual recognition arrangements, cooperation on digital shipping, feasibility studies, and among other endeavours. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, represents a landmark achievement in our collective pursuit for economic prosperity and regional integration. In this regard, Fiji needs to demonstrate its commitment to IPEF members and capitalise on the multifarious benefits that come from being part of IPEF. Before I sit down Mr. Speaker, Sir, a normal question has always been there. There are four pillars to the agreement, why are we signing only one? That has been collectively agreed by the parties and it is part of this unusual agreement that we are signing pillars individually, but that has been agreed amongst the parties on a multilateral basis. It is certainly not untoward in that manner. Finally, honourable Koya also referred to legal scrubbing. We have been consulting the Solicitor-General’s Office all the way, so in terms of the legal wording, rest assured that that has been taken care of as well. With those few words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to the Parliament and with a great deal of enthusiasm, I look forward to the implementation of the IPEF arrangement for the betterment of the Fiji economy and its people. Vinaka saka vakalevu. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by thanking the honourable Attorney-General, honourable Koya and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications for their contribution and I thank the Opposition for their support to this motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Agreement on supply chain comes at a very important time. Post- COVID, we have both very strong and difficult challenges but also we see a lot of prospects domestically. We can feel the sense of freedom and sense of confidence, and I use the word “exuberance” at times, in what the people want to see and the prosperity for our country so, in a sense, this IPEF economic framework for prosperity comes at an opportune time. We can see this in the broader geopolitical context, the Indo-Pacific Strategy, we can see this as a geoeconomic strategic interest and the fact that Fiji is part of this group which represents both, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications and honourable Koya pointed out that the group represents about 40 percent of GDP, as well as about 60 percent of the world’s population. It does provide Fiji with a lot of opportunity. The challenges we are facing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we can see, we have revised the economic growth forecast from 6 percent to a consecutive 8 percent for 2023 and that is a very, very positive sign. The tourism recovery, as was pointed out by honourable Gavoka, I think his leadership of the tourism industry right now has boosted that confidence in the post-COVID environment about the prospects of tourism in this country. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we faced a lot of challenges. In fact, in the last 18 months, we have lost about 10 percent of our labour force. This point, mentioned this as honourable Sharma said, in 2022, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not 2023, we lost 22,302 people from Fiji, of that 16, 967 went for employment and about 5,335 were basically immigrating. It is a huge challenge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but on the other side we have some very, very positive signals. We are looking at our figures for July in terms of revenue collection, very strong, more than pre-COVID levels, forecast, we are looking at our August revenue collection with very, very strong</p><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Ratification of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement 1739 indications. Remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been holding very strong in the first seven months. We had about $708 million, the forecast for 2023 is about $1.2 billion, it is relevant honourable Kumar I will tell you why it is relevant. The investment lending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been on a very strong trajectory, same with consumption spending and the labour market recovery, while sometimes you might say it is a good problem to have this challenge, the labour market growth has been very strong in terms of employment, wages, employees, employers and job advertisements. Any of the indicators that you look at is very strong. On the financial side, Mr. Speaker, we have healthy foreign reserve, liquidity is very good and as a result, interest rates are low and therefore investment spending is good. The reason why I am saying all these, Mr. Speaker and honourable Kumar was speaking from the other side about relevance is the fact that the IPEF Agreement especially on global trade supply chains are very important because it brings multiple countries. It connects economies in a way that integrates, allows countries to benefit from each other and enhance international trade through better economic interdependence because there is an agreement to deal with these countries. It also provides some sort of economic power in the sense that if you are part of this group of countries, you are able to negotiate things better. It also means good diplomacy. More than that, Mr. Speaker, the timing of the agreement, the timing of this whole geopolitical get together and especially, focusing on trade issues and supply chain issues actually provides confidence. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- The Framework? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The Framework provides confidence to the investors and those looking at countries as part of that group. That is why it is also very important, she knows about trade but she is still making those side remarks. The agreement itself provides confidence. She does not like the good news, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The good news is, the timing of the Agreement is good and it provides confidence to investors, to those looking at Fiji as a destination where people could come and invest. Of course, it also forces us as a country to look at our own ease of doing business, our regulations and our laws, and right now, we are engaged. The honourable Minister for Trade and the whole Government, including the honourable Prime Minister is involved in making sure that we have a group. We have various committees now set up by the Public Service Commission, groups of Permanent Secretaries and Investment Committees. These are groups formed to facilitate, to ensure that we actually benefit from some of these Agreements. There is no point being part of a group if we do not provide the enabling environment in the country. So, in a sense, this allows us to also accelerate and make sure that we remove all the barriers and obstacles for investment. In that sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important Agreement, and I am glad that the Opposition is giving us support for this motion. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the speakers for the meaningful interaction and debate in terms of moving Fiji to another level. It is a new Fiji. We are grateful that both parties can come and speak honestly and passionately about the subject that Fiji right now deserves to activate. I endorse this Agreement, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put.
