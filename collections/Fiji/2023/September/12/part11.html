SPEAKER.- You should have declared your interest there. (Laughter) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the review of the Levuka Town Council Annual Reports for the Years 2012 and 2013. This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), which mandates the Committee to look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media. Mr. Speaker, the Levuka Town Council 2012 and 2013 Annual Reports were referred to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs during the previous Parliament term. In this new term of Parliament, both the Annual Reports were re-introduced and referred to the current Standing Committee through the normal process for report scrutiny. The Committee was mandated by Parliament to review the Annual Reports and report back on its findings. Mr. Speaker, the vision of Levuka Town Council is “to uphold the significance of Levuka’s heritage to derive sustainable livelihoods for all”. The Mission is “to promote economic growth through improved partnerships and efficient service delivery”. Mr. Speaker, during the years 2012 and 2013, the Council highlighted a few events that made it special, for instance, the courtesy visits from the Special Administrator (Rakiraki) for the Levuka and Rakiraki tourism partnership; the Director of Local Government and Chief Executive Officer Nadi; the Ministry of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment; and the Parliament Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Mr. Speaker, further to the above, the Council carried out the following activities, it: 1. 2. 3. launched the Nomination Dossier and later Levuka Town Council was inscribed in the World Heritage Listing; hosted the arrival of Uto ni Yalo; and increased human resource capacity to enhance the services provided by the Council. Mr. Speaker, the Committee acknowledged the work carried out by the Town Council in 2012 and 2013, and it also noted the challenges and opportunities that Levuka can build on to boost its economic viability and its status as a Municipal Council. Therefore, I take this time to acknowledge the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament for their effort and input, which have assisted the current Standing Committee in the completion of this Report. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the current Members of the Standing Committee for their valuable input and support. I extend my gratitude to the Special Administrator and staff of the Levuka Town Council for their timely assistance in this review process. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1688</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>12 th Sept., 2023 and request that all honourable Members of this august Parliament take note of the Report.

BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present another report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the review of the Tavua Town Council Report for the Year Ended 2015. This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), which mandates that the Committee look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media. Mr. Speaker, the Tavua Town Council Annual Report was referred to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs during the 2018–2022 Parliament term. However, in this new term of Parliament, the Annual Report was reintroduced and referred to the current Standing Committee through the normal process for report scrutiny. The Committee was mandated by Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings. It was good to note that in 2015, the Tavua Town Council assisted stakeholders in achieving its ultimate objective by recognising its contribution to socio-economic development which uplifts the standard of Tavua Town. For instance, the Council assisted the Ministry of Agriculture in organising the Agriculture Show in Tavua. This was the first of its kind and it was an advantage for the people of Tavua to witness activities and programmes piloted by the Ministry of Agriculture. Also, the establishment of the Ex-offenders Association and the engagement of offenders in the Council. The Tavua Town Council was awarded the Clean Small Town designation in 2015. This can be seen as boosting the recognition of the town. Inter-agency meeting on child abuse, neglect and abandonment with Government Officials and the Tavua Town Council also organised its first ever New Year Street Party. The Committee commends the work carried out by the Council and would like to recommend that it continues to promote community engagement to achieve a healthy environment and an efficient infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the current Members of the Standing Committee for their valuable input and support. I also extend my gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer and Management of the Tavua Town Council for their timely assistance in this review process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and request that all honourable Members of this august Parliament take note of the Report.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>1689 (Report handed over to Secretary-General) HON.
