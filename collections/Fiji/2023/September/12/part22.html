<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – LAND TRANSPORT AUTHORITY 2014-2017 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – LAND TRANSPORT AUTHORITY 2014-2017 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the review of the Land Transport Authority 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2016-2017 Annual Report which was tabled on 30 th March of this year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Land Transport Authority’s core functions are to: 1. 2. 3. 4. establish standards for registration and licensing of vehicles and drivers; develop and implement effective and efficient enforcement strategies, consistent with road safety and the protection of the environment; develop traffic management strategies in conjunction with relevant authorities to develop and improve customer service levels in all areas of operation; and ensure equitable and affordable fare schedule for all Public Service Vehicles (PSV). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the year in review, the Committee noted the following achievements from the Land Transport Authority (LTA): 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. opening of the new Nausori LTA Office and the implementation of their Risk Management Strategies; nationwide bus and fleet audit was conducted; red light and speed cameras were installed at new sites; Japan Vehicle Export Inspection Centre went live in 2016; LTA introduced e-services; and LTA Offices underwent upgrading and refurbishment works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee is yet to receive substantive response on the Standing Committee Report, according to Standing Order 121(6)(b), which requires the agency to provide a response within 21 days of receiving the report. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate of the motion. I have here before me a list of speakers that have been identified by the honourable Whips. For the Opposition, we have four and for the Government, we have two. We will begin the first two speakers from the Opposition before we will give the floor to the honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services, and Transport and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will round it off for Government. Honourable Hem Chand, the floor is yours, Sir. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to contribute to the Review Report of the Land Transport Authority 2014-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 Annual Report. The Committee Report provides a very comprehensive overview of the LTA’s performance during this period, including its</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>1750 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 achievements and areas for improvement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee identified several areas that need to be strengthened by the Authority including the need for a very comprehensive review of the LTA Act, the need for a more robust regulatory framework, the need for better coordination between the LTA and other government agencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report notes that the LTA has made significant progress in the areas of road safety, customer service and infrastructure development. The year in review saw the opening of the new Nausori LTA office, Risk Management Strategies put into place and Go Green Project were successfully implemented. Nationwide bus and fleet audits were conducted, red light and speed cameras were installed at new sites. The Japan Vehicle Export Inspection Centre was established for the inspection of secondhand imported vehicles. Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, e-services were introduced by LTA. The Committee’s recommendations provide a roadmap for the LTA to improve its performance and better serve the people of Fiji. The Committee recommends that the LTA develop a comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategy that includes regular meetings with stakeholders, public consultations and the use of social media and other communication channels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report also highlights the need for LTA to work in collaboration with mobile service providers, private bus operators and the Ministry of Education. The Committee’s report is an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to improve the transport sector in Fiji and to ensure that it meets the needs of the people. The Report provides valuable insights into the LTA’s performance and identifies areas for improvement. The Committee’s recommendations provide a roadmap for the LTA to improves its performance and better serves the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker Sir, with the collaboration work and initiatives conducted by LTA members of the public also at this time would like to state their disappointment with the road conditions around Fiji. For example, the Princess Road from Dilkusha to the road that leads to Sawani and ACS is in bad condition which we hope the Minister will look into it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Vinaka , improve, improve.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with those words, I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to honourable Tuinaceva because he does a lot of body language as well. I had signalled to the honourable Whip whether there were four speakers so he could confirm, and he said, “yes, four,” and then he went like this. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Probably to me, that means they will speak very short. Earlier on, Honourable Usamate was explaining something in the Chamber, and he did this. (Laughter)</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 1751 MR. SPEAKER.- It is a sign that it was so small. Yes, very interesting, honourable Members. (Laughter) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution on the motion but firstly, let me thank the Committees, both the new and the old, for the preparation and presentation of this good Report. I realize that they have covered a lot of issues that are very sensitive to the public and also that touches the real core and the function of the Land Transport Authority (LTA). Mr Speaker when you closely look into the Land Transport Authority’s core function as stipulated under section 8 of the Land Transport Act 1998, which is also mentioned in this Report we will come to the fact that the 6 functions are rooted in one single word which is “Safety”. Mr Speaker Sir, I noted with interest the Committee’s emphasis on the number of Traffic Infringement Notices (TINs) issued during the period of review. The report shows an increase of 12 to 49 percent of TINs given between the year 2014, 2015 to 2016, I think that covers the early part of 2017 as well. This TIN issuance is part of being a deterrent also used as indicators on the level of effort taken by enforcement officers to clamp down on the traffic offences on our roads as stated under section 86 and 92 of the Act. Mr. Speaker Sir, the downside about TIN issuance is a reactive approach, what is disturbing is when we see an increase in TIN issuance but at the same time …. For this year, there is a spike, an example, Mr Speaker, a report released by police on 3 rd August this year 2023 stated a total of 25,960 TINs were issued for speeding offences only from the period 1 st January to June 2023. Now, the distressing part is that during the period of heavy bookings, there were 56 deaths on our roads compared to 21 in the same period last year, which is about 170 percent increase. Mr. Speaker, for the whole of 2021, there were only 25 deaths on our road, in 2022 there were about 44 deaths but here we are in the first six months of this year, 56 deaths. Mr. Speaker, common sense is telling us something is terribly wrong. Reflecting on these figures, I fully support the Committee’s recommendation in item 4.1 that the institutions responsible for road safety namely the Fiji Police Force and the Land Transport Authority need to be more proactive, acting beyond words, beyond re-active press conferences, beyond post-accident articles and beyond responding to questions from reporters. We need to drive awareness in a consistent manner targeting key stakeholders, drivers, public service vehicles, operators, pedestrians and passengers with clear measurable outcomes. Mr. Speaker, we need to dig deep, invest the funds, commit the manpower, enforce the laws, penalise, criminalise and consistently drive road safety awareness exponentially to critical mass so we are talking about road safety from the community level right up to all echelons of leadership and not sporadic awareness efforts from here and there. Mr. Speaker, I also noted from the Report, the Committee’s remarks for LTA to work in collaboration with various stakeholders to address challenges associated with e-ticketing. One of the e-ticketing objectives when the idea first came in 2011 was to save the 30 percent bus operators income that goes straight to the pocket of drivers. The understanding was that this 30 percent savings will enable bus companies to carry out fleeting especially purchasing of good buses to provide best and safe services for the people of Fiji. From 2017 when the system came into being until to-date, many challenges have been identified and I do support the Committee that a review to</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>1752 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 address the challenges to convene immediately. Mr. Speaker, I would like to give are few suggestions on some solutions LTA can take on board to assist in improving the e-ticketing service: 1. 2. 3. 4. Top up agents accessibility - the lack of agencies in both urban and the rural has become a real problem and is one of the reasons it was hard for the travelling public to get card topped- up. They do have the right to travel, and every avenue must be available in a convenient manner to assist in topping up of e-cards. Whoever the service provider that will be contracted for this particular role should find solutions that can come in many facets to address this particular issue. The connectivity - e-ticketing is internet driven, the lack of connectivity in some areas totally hinders the system and without internet, both administering the fare through e-card and top-up is impossible. If passengers are determined to travel, then their only option is to give cash to drivers. The enforcement – in any law, without proper enforcement is useless. The LTA will need to devise new methods of enforcing the e-ticketing law in a more stringent, consistent manner but only after addressing the accessibility and the connectivity problems. Tap in and the tap out concept - even if full accessibility and connectivity in the e-ticketing system, they still can tamper to benefit both the drivers and passengers illegally. With the current process, drivers can still manipulate the system and undercharge or overcharge fares, the motive is nothing else but to steal funds. Mr. Speaker, my view on the top-up, will leave the system performance and will be able to correct some errors in the current system but must be put on trial on certain routes like the urban areas and the idea is get a feel of the system, correct the fails and put into full operation when everyone is happy about the system. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Report also highlighted the increase in the number of previously registered vehicles coming into our shores. The question on the standard and the integrity of those units since most of the vehicles estimated at around 60 percent coming into our shores are from Japan. In 2016 LTA signed an agreement with the Japan Export Vehicle Inspection Centre abbreviated (JEVIC) to carry out this offshore inspection to ensure that vehicles coming to our country (Fiji) are well checked and pass the standard accepted by the Land Transport Authority. I want to say that the honourable Minister for lands who was Manager Legal at LTA that time was the one who devised all the policies and the regulations that are still being used by the Authority to check on these second-hand or used vehicle. The only sad part about this idea was when we were not able or that time to also apply the same rule into those vehicle coming from New Zealand, Australia and those coming from Singapore and Thailand which makes the young 40 percent of secondhand used vehicles that are coming into the country. Japan is accredited with the ISO1720 to carry out the structural and undercarriage inspection, including the automated and stolen vehicle verifications and even the Euro 4 standard compliance check before their shift over to Fiji. Mr. Speaker, the objective is protecting our shores and markets from what is being known as junk vehicles from Elite that there has been illegally modified and the integrity has been compromised.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 1753 The Report has recommended a close collaboration between LTA and all bus companies to achieve a 100 percent compliance quality assurance maintenance system. The Quality Management System (QMS) within a set time, I do support the recommendation by the Committee. Recently, we have watched and read reports on bus crashes, bus collision, bus fires, bus breakdowns, et cetera. Such incidents raises questions on the status of the Certificate of Fitness that are given to these buses. Mr. Speaker, the quality assurance maintenance system for heavy Public Service Vehicles is a rigorous inspection of all documentations related to bus companies, vehicle check and also the maintenance programme. It includes inspection of facilities and ensuring that bus operators maintain a daily check of all buses, a defect reporting register and a maintenance register. Mr. Speaker, this quality assurance maintenance system inspection is also critical to around 60 bus companies operating in our country when renewing their road route licence which is about 188 (RL) granted for 10 years and allows a particular bus company to operate on the given route. The implementation of the QMS means ensuring everyday safety conditions on buses, this particular scheme will give commuters great confidence in using this mode of transport. Mr. Speaker, a lot of criticisms are levelled against the bus condition within the period of their Certificate of Fitness. People are pointing to poor bus conditions, once Certificate of Fitness in a bus is valid, these QMS reflects the visions of the LTA taking the Certificate of Fitness matter to another level whereby the focus is not only for that date of inspection where the Certificate of Fitness is given but maintaining the fitness condition of these buses 365 days. In my view, LTA will need to monitor and to consistently carry out bus fleet audit to ensure the QMS compliance is at all time if they want the QMS programme to be more effective and meaningful. It is also noted from the Report the need for LTA to work closely with FRA in the construction of the road humps, zebra crossings, speed limit signages and other safety mechanisms especially at school zones. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 80 percent of deaths on our roads are caused by over speeding. It is a behavioral problem that is becoming a huge concern on our roads, and it is getting worse. I mentioned earlier that close to 26,000 bookings for speeding offences only for the first six months of this year. That is how bad the speeding problem is on our roads. Speed limit alone will not do the job. Repeated offenders should be harshly penalised, fines should be severe and license to be suspended or cancelled for those continuing to disrespect the law, otherwise our road continues to be a killing field. I am aware that the LTA is considering putting into full force the merit point system. I do commend the mover. We need to stop these drivers from over speeding and the number of deaths on our roads keep on increasing because of this speeding problem. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I thank the Committee for again bringing up the issue of traffic congestion in their Report. The negative impact of traffic congestion cannot be overstressed as it generates all sorts of problems, like air pollution, noise pollution, mental and emotional stress and economical loss. Traffic congestion is a complex subject and it has to be looked at in a total picture. I want to say that there was a report prepared by the FRA titled, “Greater Suva Transportation Strategies” some years ago which was headed by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs. A great report, Sir, it had the views of some great engineers in the region. They identified great ideas which we can use to solve and address the congestion problems on our roads. The ideas like the dedicated bus lanes, linked</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>1754 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 traffic signals, improve the bus terminals, intersection upgrades and carpooling as the solution for traffic during peak hours. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I thank the Committee for their great work, and I support the motion. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Opposition Members for their contribution. Because we are the largest party here in this Parliament, we will have a lot of speakers from this side. Unfortunately, there are three small parties on the other side, so I can imagine the amount of speech they will make. Today, I stand before you to support the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs regarding the review of the Land Transport Authority for the years 2014 to 2017. This Report shed light on the crucial aspects of our transportation system and provides invariable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I must commend the Standing Committee for its diligent work in scrutinising the LTA’s activities during this period. Their efforts have enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of the issues facing our transportation sector and have laid the foundation for a meaningful change. One of the key findings of this Report that warrants our attention is the significant increase in Traffic Infringement Notices (TINs) issued and vehicles seized between 2014 and 2017. Whilst some may argue that this reflects a heavy-handed approach, we must recognise that this surge is primarily due to the expanding vehicle population on our roads. With more vehicles comes with greater responsibility to ensure road safety. The LTA in collaboration with the Fiji Police Force has been conducting more random checks and enforcement operations to maintain order on our roads. This is a necessary step to protect the lives of our citizens. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the road conditions in our country are deteriorating rapidly. Our infrastructure is crumbling and yet the Land Transport Authority continues to charge vehicle drivers for road levies. This is a matter of grave concern. How can we justify collecting these levies when the very roads they are intended to maintain are in such a dire state? I urge the honourable Minister responsible for transportation and I think the same Minister is responsible for roads as well to take immediate action. It is not enough to charge our citizens for road levies without ensuring that their hard-earned money is invested in road maintenance and improvements. We must address these issues urgently and allocate the necessary funds to repair and upgrade our road infrastructure. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been distressing reports of misconduct by LTA officers during road inspections. Such behaviour not only tarnishes the reputation of the LTA but also erodes the trust of the public. We need transparency and accountability in the actions of our enforcement officers. The Minister must step up to ensure that officers are held accountable for their actions and that proper training and oversight are in place to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we applaud the LTA for its effort to improve the road safety and transportation services in Fiji, there are pressing issues that demand our attention. We must prioritise the maintenance of our roads as highlighted by honourable Hem Chand, the roads that leads to Sawani, Muaniweni and these areas, I had the opportunity to personally visit these areas and the road condition is pathetic. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Where in Naitasiri?</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 1755 HON. K. K. LAL.- If you had listened to me a while ago you would have heard - Muaniweni, Sawani and Viria. If you want, I can give you a tour, do not worry. (Laughter) But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must also hold our LTA officers accountable for their conduct and ensure that such implementation of initiatives like the e-ticketing system as well. I call upon all Members of Parliament to support the Report before us. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion in front of us regarding the LTA Annual Report 2014-2017. As noted, it is quite dated, there are quite a few issues raised there including the improvements. There is emphasis on road safety which is acknowledged. Unfortunately, there used to be a National Road Safety Council, and this had been done away with by the last government. So, again this is one of the areas which we need to improve on as we move forward. There are various issues regarding collaboration. There is a qualified audit opinion which has been mentioned there and LTA is taking the necessary processes. There have been assurance given, also given the dated Annual Reports, when I came into the Ministry that is one of the big weaknesses in terms of monitoring and evaluation and reporting within the Ministry. Again, this is an inheritance from the last government which we will need to rectify and work on. That not only includes the reporting from within the Ministry but also the agencies like LTA. So, if we have had efficient, effective monitoring systems from the previous administration then we might not have been in this situation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Vakarorogo mada:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Big issue on potholes, pot holes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> There is also an issue on Japan Export Vehicle Inspection Centre, that is a very significant and good development as explained by honourable Tuinaceva who is very knowledgeable in the industry as a former CEO and also he is a transport engineer, I believe. I acknowledge the assistance and the exchange we always have which is very critical as we move forward. E-ticketing has been mentioned, and there is a joint committee under the Minister of Communications working on that and we should be working towards a solution. I understand the various challenges faced with e-ticketing. I mentioned road safety awareness but I do not want to repeat that. There are various complex legislations in the LTA Act and the regulations, et cetera. All this is currently being looked at, but it cannot be looked at in isolation - it needs to be looked at holistically. People can still sell their permits and this is one of the major issues that we are looking at reviewing and some permits have been sold for up to nearly $100,000. It has become an industry in itself and again that is an issue which continues to breed unethical practices. Honourable Ketan Lal has specifically asked me to step up – yes, we are stepping up. The taxi lottery that was a methodology for distributing taxi permits which was just a joke. That is something we are working on fixing. We have the open system and the base system – two systems which are essentially contradictory which we will need to resolve.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>1756 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 12 th Sept., 2023 Some other issues have been raised by the opposition on the infrastructure - you have mentioned the roads et cetera. Again, as I have already mentioned, this is an issue which we, as a Government, have inherited, and a lot of those issues were because you guys spent the budget and in December it was done, there was no money - that is why the roads you are going on has a lot of potholes. You are twisting it around. Instead, you should be saying “We are the result of the bad roads, not you.” A lot of the issues raised are symptoms or outcomes of what has been happening in the last few years - it did not just happen now. It is the results of frameworks and systems which have been there for the last 10 or so years and we are in the process of looking at those issues including the roads - I have mentioned it. The reform within FRA, the reform within PWD - a lot of the roads you mention have been neglected because FRA in the past has said that it is a non-FRA road. That is the problem, but now we are working at amalgamating those and ensuring that not only the institutions but also the infrastructure, move forward as one. Thank you. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise in support of the motion and would like to thank the former committee members and the current committee members for the report and also like to thank the LTA Management for the work done during those particular years of the report. Mr. Speaker Sir, my colleagues have already spoken on a lot of points, so once again I support the motion before the Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Thank you, Mr Speaker Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.:</span> When will you fix the potholes, honourable Minister? MR. SPEAKER.- Just try to listen, honourable Member. HON. PROF B. C. PRASAD.- I know the honourable Minister provided the responses very well. He basically destroyed the myth or the lies that keep coming from the other side, especially some of the new honourable Members. I think the older ones probably understand the legacy. Let me just remind them, Mr. Speaker, we are looking at 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 Reports. This itself proves the point that honourable Minister Tuisawau was making about the laxity issues. Honourable Tuinaceva was a Chief Executive Officer in 2015 so I am not sure whether he is also responsible for the delay in getting these Reports. Let me just give you an example. We are looking at the Reports and we cannot understand how an organisation does if the Reports do not come on a timely manner, and if they are not scrutinised by the Office of the Auditor-General or not scrutinised by the Parliament - this was a consistent problem. All of us in the Opposition knew about the previous governments inability to bring Annual Reports on time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Levu na vosa, lailai na cakacaka.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF B. C. PRASAD.- So, we are looking at 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2017-2018, this is the update. They do not like this, but this is the fact. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>12 th Sept., 2023 Review Report – LTA 2014-2017 Annual Reports 1757 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the update of the reports: • • • • • 2017-2018 - the Annual Report design has been completed, this has yet to be finalised and printed. 2018-2019 - this is in progress, the Report will be designed and printed in the 2023-2024 financial year. 2019-2020 - this is in progress. The completion of the Report is dependent on the completion of the audit. 2020-2021 - this is in progress. The completion of the Report is dependent on the completion of the audit. 2021-2022 - this is in progress. The completion of the Report is dependent on the completion of the audit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they talk about the problems that we have. They were the most manipulative government in terms of what was happening in the Land Transport Authority. The whole apparatus and organisation were dysfunctional. That is why we have not been able to get the Reports on time. Here we are talking about these Reports and trying to tell the new Government what it should have done in the last six months.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR - Nine months:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Of course, we are doing it. As the honourable Minister said, they are talking about the road conditions.

Crooks running the organisation and they were not able to fix and spend money and give value for money.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S.

We have a right environment, right process to follow so that we ensure there is value for money. But the point that they need to admit, they need to accept is that we were not able to produce annual reports on time. The Auditor-General was not able to look at the accounts. How can we in this Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the horse has bolted already - audit reports are pending for years. How can you run an organisation based on that? That is the point we are making, and we are now as a Government, we are making sure and we will ensure that there is proper monitoring, evaluation of organisations, statutory organisations, government commercial companies where Government puts in taxpayers funds, that we get timely annual reports. We get timely audits so that we have a proper perspective on how the organisations are running and whether they are performing. That is the most important aspect of the work of this Parliament, the work of various Committees but if the reports are not there, how can we do that, Mr. Speaker? Let me just conclude by saying that the Government in the last Budget has provided adequate funding to LTA and FRA. There are new structures, new processes are being put in place, a lot of work has already been done, and roads are being identified. Of course, we understand there are areas where the roads need urgent attention, there are potholes in some of the roads, but that is going to be fixed and I want to assure the people of Fiji and those who are affected in areas where the roads are not as good as it ought to be - the Fiji Roads Authority as the honourable Minister said, is on track and these issues will be addressed as quickly as possible. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all our honourable Members that contributed to the motion before Parliament.
