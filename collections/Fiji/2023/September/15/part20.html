<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 145/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection (Ref. Page: 1922-1923) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Response to Question No. 145/2023 is as follows: a) In Fiji, we do not have anyone that is regarded as homeless. For the iTaukei men and women on our streets, they all belong to a family, to a village, to a mataqali, to a yavusa, to a province and therefore they cannot say that they are homeless. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot share the number for the last 10 years because this is the first initiative that was taken to actually profile all those that are living on our streets and identify pathways that can give them hope and a new life. Please allow me to highlight that as of Friday, 8 th September, 2023 there has been 178 profiled street dwellers in Suva, Lautoka and Nadi. From the 178 profiled cases, 39 women were profiled and 55 children. We are currently working together with other government stakeholders and NGOs to get them off the streets, identify shelters in which they can be assisted and empowered on a short term basis before they proceed to other programmes like Seed of Success, APTC short courses, joining the Youth Band or part of training schools like Nadave, Tutu and Navuso. b) The Ministry assists single parents including single mothers under its household targeted programmes. Of the Child Protection Allowance and the Family Assistance Scheme, at the moment, we are currently assisting a total of approximately 35,233 households. We are currently in the first phase of Social Protection Reform through our partnership with World Bank and DFAT where all our data will be digitalised. Once our system is up and running, information such as gender, age group and other important details will be readily available as and when the need arises.
