<body><h3>HERITAGE BILL 2023</h3><h4>HERITAGE BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the – (a) Heritage Bill 2023 be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must immediately be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the November Sitting of Parliament upon</p><h4>presentation of Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee; and</h4><p>(e) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament at the November Sitting, and that one hour be given to debate on the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you would have observed, I had tabled a motion in this august Parliament on Tuesday, that the Heritage Bill 2023 be debated and voted upon without delay. We heard the views of our colleagues and views from the other side and found merit in their views. We have the existing Heritage Bill 2023 be referred to the Standing Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we listen and took heed of their views although this Bill has been a subject of many, many discussions over the years since 2016. We considered, we did not ignore and humbly made the decision to withdraw our motion to accommodate request from the other side. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to emphasise the point here because that is how laws in a country are made. We are not ignorant but we are here to work together for the benefit of our people. Therefore, I rise to add to what I have highlighted on Tuesday. The National Heritage is something that is treasured to all of us, a country in the Pacific that is both diverse and strategically placed in the South Pacific. Fiji is rich with culture and diversity while at the same time maintain strong links to our traditions and heritage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Convention concerning the Protection of World Council National Heritage which was adopted at the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference in 1972 on the 21 st November, 1990. It is one such international instrument that specifically identifies or recognises the preservation of fiscal structures and sites. As a member State, Fiji is required to adopt the legislative and administrative provisions to give effect to the World Heritage Convention. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Heritage Bill 2023 provides for the domestic application of the World Heritage Convention in Fiji. No changes have been made to the Bill as tabled on Tuesday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and each honourable Members would have a copy. It is my prayer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that given my motion this morning, this august</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023 Heritage Bill 2023 1935 Parliament will agree to support my motion so there is no further delay in deliberating an important proposed law for us. I, therefore, commend the Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I think there is only just one speaker from this side and I will not be long. Just to assure the Honourable Attorney General that yes, we do support it, I think. We want to thank the government also for listening to what was said the other day with respect to the Heritage Bill. It is important, it is about Fiji, and we understand all the technicalities that actually go on. This is a Bill that was instigated by us in the first place and I think it is important that we do realise that it has to do with Fiji and it has to do with our commitments that we have also made with respect to UNESCO and World Heritage sites, et cetera. Just to give a little background on the two, they were quite a few observations that came out of visits by the previous Standing Committee - Tui Levuka and this is why we intend to take a little bit long nevertheless Sir, as somebody who is also a Member of the Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. I have spoken to my Chair and we will endeavour to have this back as quickly as possible and do the necessary work that needs to be undertaken before the November Session Sir. So, you have our support with respect to getting it done as quickly as possible. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the unanimous decision to support the Bill, I have no right of reply but I commend the Bill. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Heritage Bill 2023 referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights] HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I am sorry, Sir. Can I just raise a Point of Order? Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just raise a Point of Order under Standing Order 74(1) on the practices of Parliament and I hope I can qualify under 80 as well just to make a personal explanation and perhaps on prohibited reference as well on 62. On the Statement made by the honourable Minister for Finance when making his reply to the End of Week Statement, I will be waiting for the Uncorrected Daily Hansard, Sir. He used the term “looted” - This is the government that looted the workers of this country by utilising their FNPF savings. I am concerned about the use of the word “looted” the workers of this country. I find that as improper Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to place it on record before we adjourn this meeting. It is entirely up to you, Sir, on your ruling, so I leave it to you. MR. SPEAKER.- Do you have anything to say to that, honourable Deputy Prime Minister? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- All I said, Mr. Speaker, was in reference to the FNPF Pension Act, that is a fact. That was a Government that made the decision - the Bainimarama Government. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1936</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 HON. J. USAMATE.- Did you use the word “looted”? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Yes, I used the word “looted” it was the Bainimarama government that passed the Decree and terminated the FNPF workers’ contracts and they lost pension and they had no recourse to go back to the court because there was another decree which did not even allow that. (Chorus of interjections) That was what I said, and I stand by that. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will take note of that concern raised by the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Members, I am on the floor, see that leads me to what I was about to say as well after the adjournment motion and that is, if it is possible during this break to November. Honourable Members, please take heed of the difficult task of trying to allow debate to free flow in this august Parliament. At the same time, you should be mindful of the decision that we both make here through the Business Committee, that is the “Timing Element” that presents here how we address the timing of each participant to participate effectively in the debate. I will want to put on record the intention that I have in mind, and this will be brought about in the usual manner through the Business Committee and that is, I will give 30 seconds countdown every time we do debate. This is just like attending an international meeting. You are still on the floor, the speaker will be giving you 30 seconds countdown, when the countdown finishes at the zero time then you are required to sit down even though you still have a lot on your table to present. I think I have been lenient in allowing people to go over on both sides of the Parliament. But we should be mindful of the effects that that will have on the timing of the sitting of the Parliament.</p></body>
