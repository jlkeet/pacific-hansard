<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Processing of Vacancies in the Ministry of Health (Question No. 135/2023) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on how the Ministry is addressing the delay in the processing of vacancies for Health Officers? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the honourable</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1905 Member for his first Oral Question. Sir, the Ministry has in place a recruitment plan based on the approved budget and that will ensure timely filling of funded vacancies. These vacancies include newly created positions, regularised positions, selected vacant unfunded positions from previous Financial Years and vacant positions due to post-holders’ promotion, retirement, death, resignation, deemed resignation and termination. Our HR team had conducted post-Budget awareness consultation sessions with all 13 core centres under the Ministry covering the four Divisional Health Services, three major Hospitals, two Specialized Hospitals, Fiji Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Services, Public Health Programme, Health Protection; and Headquarters, to finalise positions to be filled based on the given budget. In terms of processing of vacancies, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is strengthening its processes, including: 1. Advertisement of open vacancies which will allow for valid merit candidates. 2. 3. 4. Pool for 12 months to fill positions based on the Ministry’s need. Filling of vacant positions from the available valid merit pool Full adoption of recruitment online through Government’s recruitment portal except for medical positions Posting of medical officers, registered nurses, pharmacists and dental officers once their completion of internship is confirmed. Creation of additional HR and corporate positions in all core centres to assist in the vacancies processing activities whenever required. 5. 6. 7. Acting appointment is processed through expression of interest to fill specialized positions while awaiting the permanent filling of positions through the Open Merit and Recruitment Selection process. 8. Opening of citizenship criteria that is not limited to Fijian citizenship for Registered Nurse positions. Mr. Speaker Sir, one of the challenges that the Ministry faced in speeding up the recruitment and appointment of new staff members in the last financial year was the lack of Corporate staff within the Ministry to facilitate the necessary Civil Service-endorsed recruitment processes, because of civil service policies that existed prior to the Coalition Government taking office. We raised our concerns during the budget consultation process and very grateful for Government’s budget approval in the 2023-2024 financial year for the Ministry to recruit essential corporate staff members who are critical in running the human resources management processes for the Ministry. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services continues to align its recruitment processes to all relevant legislations and guidelines during this transitions period awaiting finalization of employment policies. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for a very comprehensive answer. Is the honourable Minister aware that there are 24 vacancies in the Radiology Department? There are graduates coming out of the Fiji National University (FNU) but they tend to enter the private sector because of the good salary offered. Would the honourable Minister consider the plight of X-Ray technicians in the Ministry of Health because of the crucial role that they play? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Ravunawa for his supplementary question. Yes, I agree in terms of graduates coming out from the tertiary institutions.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1906</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 In terms of work needs, there are always vacancies there. The challenge with the Ministry right now is the opening of some of the new private facilities and they take most of the staff within the Ministry. Another challenge within the Ministry is the planning process in terms of requesting tertiary intuitions to increase the number of intakes in terms of those cadre and also on how we can expand ourselves in terms of services for recruitment. Extension to the Agreement of Cooperation (Question No. 136/2023) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the Extension to the Agreement of Cooperation with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question raised before this august Parliament this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Agreement of Cooperation is a collaboration established in 2018 between the Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Local Government and UN Habitat. The collaboration was made after identifying the need for a programme that addresses the need tackle the frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as flooding, droughts, cyclones and long-term sea-level rise that negatively impact informal settlements around the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Habitat and Ministry of Housing had prepared a proposal, increasing the resilience of informal urban settlements in Fiji that were highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks - the Adaptation Fund initially provided funding of US $299,000 for one year from 2018 to 2019. In 2019 Mr. Speaker, Sir, additional activities were included to this Agreement of Corporation, that included the engagement of 2 consultants; supported the finalisation of community action plans and identified community capacity needs. This resulted in the extension of the Agreement of Corporation for another year from 2019 to 2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, the Agreement was further extended until 2021 to cover delays in implementation of activities due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. With extension to the Agreement, funding was also increased to US$365,000. In 2021, the Agreement was extended until 2022 as capital projects were included for 16 targeted settlement-based action plans. Funding was also increased to US $3.1 million to implement the project. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of the project was affected again because of the second wave of COVID-19 in Fiji. The delay in capital works led to the extension of the Agreement until 2023 which was endorsed by Cabinet in January 2023. The delay in endorsement of the Agreement, Sir, lessened the duration to complete the capital project works, coupled with the recovery from the global pandemic, hence the Agreement has been further extended until 2024 to complete the planned capital works. The Ministry will, firstly, be commencing capital works on three sites out of the 16 settlements that have been initially identified. These sites are located in the Central Division and situated on State land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had conducted the tender process for consultancy works on the</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1907 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had conducted the tender process for consultancy works on the pilot projects. However, due to high tender bid amounts received, the Ministry had to seek alternatives within Government. The Ministry has, therefore, engaged the services of Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Metrological Services, for the designing of engineering plans for the three sites. The upgrading works have been prioritised according to the needs of the communities, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This was done through consultation between the sitting tenants and UN Habitat. These upgrading works are expected to be implemented once engineering plans are finalised. Upon completion of the project works, a total 223 households will benefit from improvements made in the settlements to increase the resilience to impacts of climate change and disaster risks. Provision of Sales Data (Question No.137/2023) HON. S. S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament on the reasons for not providing the Sales Data to the Valuers and Financial Institutes since April 2023, which is essential to Valuers in determining the Fair Market Value of properties when carrying out valuation? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide the answer to honourable Kirpal’s question. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Lands, through the Office of the Chief Valuer, is responsible for the collection and recording of all property data. That is the Sales Data that we are discussing here, and monthly reports which are disseminated for the purposes of the public and also for those who might want to privately gather that information at a minimum fee. The data, Sir, is used by those who are experts in interpreting the property market throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, historically, Sales Data is meant for registered Valuers and is critical for them when they undertake valuation work in Fiji. The data is an integral part of the valuation process, and it is required for valuation reports for mortgages, transfers, property matters, as well as used for sales and purchase. Mr. Speaker, prior to the repealing of the Stamp Duties Act 1920 that provided the focal point for the collection of such information, there was at the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS), Stamp Duty’s Office here in Suva. The Ministry was allowed under an MOU to collect property data or instruments that were bought for stamp duty or transfer of any land to FRCS. In exchange, the Ministry of Lands would assist FRCS in determining the market value of such properties under the Stamp Duties Act 1920 and carry out valuation of such property at a minimum applicable rate under the Valuation Registration Act 1986. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the repealing of the Stamp Duties Act 1920 through the repealing legislation in 2020, as a result, the FRCS no longer collects stamp duties. So, consequently, from 2020, the Ministry had to collect data from the Capital Gains Tax Section and not from the Stamp Duty’s Section. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 3 rd March, 2022, FRCS decided to withhold access to the Sales Data to the Ministry and as at from that date, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources do not have access to the daily Sales Data that we used to have from FRCS.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1908</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, a few months later in September, the then CEO of FRCS terminated the MOU that we had with FRCS because it appears to disclose information which are confidential to the taxpayer. So, pursuant to Regulation 51(3b) of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (Information Sharing) Regulations 2019, the MOU that we had enjoyed with FRCS for many years that allowed us to have access to information so that we can upgrade our data at the Chief Valuer’s Office was repealed or terminated by FRCS, so we have gone for more than two years now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, without the essential upgrade of that database. The way forward, Mr. Speaker, is that now, the Ministry of Lands is seeking to access the same data from two agencies and that is through the Registrar of Titles Office via the Ministry of Justice, and also with the Ministry of Information through ITC Services. The Ministry is currently working with the Solicitor General’s Office in finalising the draft MOU with the Ministry of Justice. This MOU, when it is finalised and executed, will allow the daily connection, as well as recording of relevant property sales information or transfer documents that have been lodged by parties at the Registrar of Titles Office. Considering that there will be a lapse in Sales Data from April 2023 to the day in which we ultimately intend to sign this MOU once it clears all the legal hurdles, we have tried to engage with ITC through the Ministry of Information and we have consulted with them just to be ensure that we are being provided with an alternative source of data upgrade that we can access from the Registrar of Titles Office. Now, if that happens, it will allow us to retrieve information that have been lodged with the Registrar of Titles Office as from April 2023 to ultimately the date we soon hope we are going to put signatures on the MOU with the Ministry of Justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, being proactive as of 1 st August this year, the Ministry, through the Office of THE Chief Valuer, has commenced with the collection and the recording of the all the property sales information of transfer documents that have been lodged with the Registrar of Titles Office. We would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Attorney General in facilitating and ensuring that we are able to commence with the collection of this important data whilst the MOU is being finalised. We are collecting the information and it will ultimately be available to the public and to the Valuers once we sign off on the MOU. Since the information collected from the Registrar of Titles Office is confidential until the registration of the documents on the different titles, public search, the Ministry will be drafting individual agreements with registered Valuers and their respective companies to safeguard the disseminated sales data information. I wish to conclude that we are currently working towards having the people of Fiji with a relevant and right information on the database for leverage and for their own empowerment including all registered Valuers and I hope that we are going to be putting signature, as I said, top aper in the next month or so, so that we can upgrade all of the information that is needed from 2020 and up until real time and that information will soon be available to the registered valuers as well as to the rest of the public. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, if memory serves me correct, there is physically a person that actually goes across from the Ministry of Lands to the Registrar of Titles Office on a daily basis to collect the raw data. The data is actually given by the Registrar of Titles Office to the Ministry of Lands and that should be sufficient to give the actual raw Sales Data to the institutions that require it. I am just wondering whether that is actually continuing and I think that was still being done</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1909 because there was a digitisation process that was to take place at the Registrar of Titles Office, which I think is not quite completed but until it is digitised, it would be simple to just have digital access to each department or each government has access to it. But that particular information was being lifted from the Registrar of Titles Office on a daily basis physically to be provided to the Ministry of Lands to update their data, to say that these sales took place. Is that still happening? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure Parliament that the uplifting of daily Sales Data just commenced. We have picked up on a draft MOU that was sent to the Office of the Attorney-General in the first part of this year. They are currently looking through the MOU to get through all the legal issues that we need to deal with. However, at this moment, we are picking up the information on a daily basis. We are not making them available because what we wanted to do is to pull all the information that we needed to do to upgrade the database from 2020 up until this time. So, I am sure that when we sit again in the month of November, I would have a better update for Parliament on where we are. But certainly, we are working hard to ensure that all the Valuers are made available with the right information on time. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, consumers also need Sales Data to make an informed decision when they are buying a property and for that reason, the Real Estate Board has started to create a database online so that people can hook up and find out if a property is being sold in a particular area, the price of the property say one year ago or two years ago or three years ago. My question to you honourable Minister is, how is the Real Estate Board working with the Ministry of Lands to also support the general public who are being often ripped off for not knowing the price in a particular area and end up paying a lot more? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can say that I am not privy to whether the Real Estate Board and the Ministry of Lands worked together on the upgrade of the database. What I am sure about is, under statute, the Chief Valuer is supposed to be the ‘go to’ person when someone requires information such as valuation of properties. But I can assure the honourable Member that if there is a database with the Real Estate Board, that is something that we can have. I can advise the Ministry to try and figure out a way of working with the Real Estate Board so that we can together provide the public with the best platform of information from which they can draw their decisions from. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very thankful to the honourable Minister for the explanation. However, like in our valuation, we pay a very heavy amount of Professional Indemnity (PI) cover, so I kindly request the honourable Minister if that can be done quickly so that no liability comes to us because now we are carrying out our valuation, not only me but all the companies of Fiji. We are relying on the data that we have. We do not take the data which the Real Estate tells us, because most of the time their data is incorrect because the sale has not taken place, the data comes here, I think. So, I really appreciate the honourable Minister’s explanation that the data is coming, and I will really appreciate if the data can be made available as soon as possible for all the registered Valuers of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply to that honourable Minister, I would like to declare my interest here as a registered Valuer as well. He keeps mentioning this every time he speaks on the issue of valuation, but I think that data is very critical for Valuers so as to get a proper valuation, when we analyse the sales, the members of the public as referred to by honourable Premila Kumar, is protected here. At the same time, the Valuer is answerable for his analysis of the sales of similar kind of properties that the client wishes to purchase, so to speak. The data is quite important for the basis</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1910</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 that they will have the Valuer deduce whatever value by whatever method he/she applies so that makes it transparent as well to members of the public. You may have heard, as alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar, there are certain kinds of sales done by dubious means of getting a sale through and there are so many ways. When we analyse the sale, we can reduce that, it is a ‘for sale’. It is unrealistic and because you may imagine, honourable Members, the sale price of properties that we have in Fiji is almost a million or well over a million dollars now, what makes that happen could be anyone’s guess - a pure sale that has taken through where a willing buyer and a willing seller concept applies at the same time, it can be all inflated as well. How do we take care of that? Data is quite important for us because we no longer pay stamp duties but we still have the Capital Gains Tax. We used to get data through the Stamp Duties Office but now when it has changed through the change of law, that is quite difficult to get as well, but data is vital for every Valuer’s work in this country. I now give you the opportunity to reply to that statement if you want to, honourable Minister. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have provided the answer and more that I was going to reply to honourable Kirpals’ question. Thank you very much, Sir. Exchange of Notes on Japan’s Grant Aid (Question No. 138/2023) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the Exchange of Notes on Japan’s Grant Aid to the Ministry under the Economic and Social Development Programme? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Bainivalu for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Exchange of Notes on Japan’s Grant Aid to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services under the Economic and Social Development Programme was undertaken on Monday, 21 st August, 2023 at the Ministry of Health and Medical Services Headquarters. Sir, Exchange of Notes formalises mechanisms of cooperation between the Government of Japan and the Government of Fiji to promote economic and social development in Fiji through the Grand Aid Support Project with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. In November 2022, the Ministry had approached the Embassy of Japan in Fiji, for them to support the strengthening of primary healthcare in Fiji through an integrated model of primary healthcare delivery. The Government of Japan responded through the Embassy of Japan in Fiji, approving a grant of JPY¥150 million which is equivalent to FJ$2.4 million to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to purchase two medical containers and vital medical equipment and products. The medical containers are fully fitted mobile health clinics that have the appropriate type of bio- medical equipment that will allow our health staff to conduct primary healthcare services and activities wherever in Fiji the container is sited at. The Grant Aid Project will also facilitate the proper installation of biomedical equipment inside the medical container clinics and once the fully fitted medical container clinics are in the country, the project will facilitate the training of local health staff on the use and upkeep of the medical container clinics.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1911 Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the endorsement of the Exchange of Note, the parties are progressing to process and to facilitate the release of funds from the Government of Japan and the engaging of the Japan International Co-operation System (JICS) which is the Japan based agents that deal directly with the Government of Japan on Grant Aid Projects. Sir, JICS will facilitate on our behalf the purchase of the medical container and biomedical equipment. Sir, the Grant Aid Project has a two years’ timeline from the date of signing of the Agreement and the Ministry looks forward to the full implementation and completion of the project which will add further capacity to our Primary Healthcare approach to Fiji. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- A supplementary question. Honourable Minister, forgive me, there will be two parts to my question. We receive a lot of assistance from friends and partners, rotary clubs and a lot of medical equipment are also included. But one thing that I noted, Sir, is particularly having worked in the rural areas is the lack of Biomedical Technicians/Engineers to fix equipment when they have problems with it. My question is: 1. 2. In the Ministry of Health in terms of availability of Biomedical Engineers and Technicians, do we have them only at the Divisional Hospitals or Sub-Divisional Hospitals, or how far down do you have them? I know that there is serious shortage of this skill. A cousin of mine is now with Sai Prema Foundation Fiji. He has retired for the last few years, but they are looking for this. What is the Ministry doing about having more of such skills so that they can add effectiveness to your services, honourable Minister? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his supplementary question and I fully concur and agree with his comments that our Biomedical staff are important in the delivery of quality healthcare. At the moment, Sir, the Biomedical cadre on its own is a small group of specialists. They are available at the Divisional level for now but moreso, located in the Fiji Pharmaceutical &amp; Biomedical Services (FPBS). We are in the process of planning for more capacity building within this cadre. We have recognised that in the field of medicine and health, if we move forward in the future, there will be more need for biomedical services. We have discussed with the Ministry that it should be a cadre on its own within the Ministry. There is an ongoing plan on building capacity within our Biomedical Specialist people. I believe one of our Biomedical Heads right now is honourable Bulitavu’s sister. They are an important part of the Ministerial of Health, and we will look after them in terms of training, especially to make it a cadre on its own because there is a need for them moving forward into the future. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to hear the assistance that Japan has been providing to the Ministry of Health over the years. I think in areas like NCD Programme, 5S and this particular programme. And also, I am glad as we are getting these containers, I think they will complement the service that is provide by MV Veivueti which gets people around the country. I am interested in the actual services, the kind of services that will be provided from these containers in terms of primary health and the importance also of primary health in terms of preventative health. A lot of time we talk about doing things after the cat has run away already, but the range of services that have been provided from these containers, I assume that there will be people involved with them and whether they are just to be used in Viti Levu or across to other islands; will</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1912</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 the containers be carried around? HON. DR. RATU. A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Usamate for his supplementary question. Honourable Member, the containers are the mobile clinics, therefore, there are two that I have been briefed on. There will be one in Viti Levu and one in the North for now. It is kind of a pilot project for now and for those containers to be moved around, we need proper preparatory work done so that when we move the containers, all the connections are readily available like electricity, water, et cetera. In terms of the services, the primary healthcare services like the normal GOPD work plus laboratory as well. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Bainivalu for asking this question. I know that the comprehensive economic and social development programme had begun operations since 2016. May I sound it here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that His Excellency our President is now the champion for oral health in the country. Oral Health is the state of mouth, teeth and our facial structure which perform essential functions such as eating, breathing, speaking and also our psychological dimensions. My short question to the honourable Minister, will he consider oral health in this container that is custom-made for the purpose of primary healthcare delivery in our country? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Ravunawa for the supplementary question. Yes, I forgot oral health will also be included in it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Vinaka:</span></p><p>Increase in Roads Accidents and Deaths (Question No. 139/2023) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the measures being undertaken by the Ministry and the Land Transport Authority to address the dramatic increase on the number of road accidents and deaths which has set a shocking record of 53 fatalities between January to June 2023 compared to 21 deaths for the same period in 2022? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. As I had mentioned earlier this week, road safety is everyone’s responsibility. It is vital because many lives are at stake and it just takes a couple of seconds looking away for an accident to occur. Sir, poor driving behaviour on Fiji’s roads has led to a spike in road fatalities as mentioned. To address this alarming spike, Land Transport Authority (LTA) is considering increase in traffic fines as a deterrent moving forward. In terms of the figures as mentioned, the current death toll stands at 60 as of 24 th August, 2023 compared to 21. In assessing the alarming trend, there was a spike in Group 2 driving licence holders involved in accidents or road fatalities from the statistics provided. From January 2023 to May 2023, the LTA did a driver profiling analysis and noted that 53 percent of fatal crashes involved private Class 2 vehicles. The enforcement by LTA, Police and stakeholders continues to curb illegal activities and also preventative measures. From August 2022 to the end of July 2023, 98,918 camera Traffic</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1913 Infringement Notices (TINs) were issued by LTA and in the same period 133,664 vehicles were intercepted and 6,389 defect orders issued. To address issues of driver behaviour, LTA and relevant stakeholders have enhanced measures, apart from the existing driver knowledge test system and practical driving test in place, there are other measures which have been looked into and currently followed. We are looking into measures to introduce two categories of Provisional Licence before they qualify for a full licence. We are also looking at demerit points to be issued by LTA and incentives such as gold cards for complying drivers who will be entitled to privileged services and, of course, mandatory Defensive Driving Courses Training for Group 2 licence holders on a six-yearly basis. We continue to conduct show-cause hearings and counselling sessions for drivers in the three regions. In 2022-2023, 2,508 driver licence holders were summoned for either show-cause or counsellling. At regional office, 2,173 warning letters and 28 licence holders were issued with final warnings. In addition, LTA is also reviving the Hands-on Wheels Programme and Driver assessment exercise, participants are taken through driving lessons, undergoing what they have been taught in Mandatory Defence Driving Courses before individual assessments. We are working closely with employers and agencies in conducting driver-assessments of employee drivers and through public consultations. We are also working with the Ministry of Education for the introduction of road safety education in the curriculum from an early age right up to secondary school as there is quite an increase in the number of young drivers holding Provisional Licences. There is a need for inclusion of Road Safety Awareness through various stakeholders and we will continue to advocate for that, also working with other relevant agencies in the process of reconvening the technical working group on road safety. To end, I believe with all road users; drivers, passengers and pedestrians to observe and adhere to road laws and also in terms of road safety which is everyone’s responsibility. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, thank very much indeed for that response. I really agree with you. Sir, road safety is everyone's responsibility. Just a question to the honourable Minister, about 70 percent of deaths on our roads are caused by overspeeding. You are saying that about 15 percent are caused by road condition. Now, 10 percent of those are said to be because of poor road markings and traffic signs. I know because I travel the Sawani/Colo-i-Suva road everyday, the road has been like that for sometimes now without proper road markings. There are no centre lines, no centre meridian, not even the side marking lines as that will tell the drivers what to do. On these road sign programmes plus the traffic signage restoration, is there a programme undertaken by FRA to see into these kinds of issues and problems? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, I have already briefed Parliament on the programme of FRA regarding the Princess Road and Sawani, Serea. The roads are currently affected by the Rewa Water Project because it would be illogical to do the resealing now, but we are nearing completion of that project and the road resealing is budgeted for and we will be working on that in the current budget to upgrade that road. But on the other hand, the bad roads also slow down the speeding drivers. (Laughter) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank you and the Business</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1914</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 Committee for allowing this question to be asked in Parliament, an important subject on the carnage on our roads. When we talk about road safety and road fatalities, the bottom line is, it is trying to save lives on our roads. It is like when we say, “Search and Rescue at Sea”, it is really trying to save lives at sea. I see that there are two sides to it, one is prevention and the other side is for us to be able to save lives when an accident happens on our road. Before I ask the question, just as an example, last week a big club of wives and mothers in the RFMF of 800 or almost 1,000 had their sporting event at Black Rock. They were told that all the buses wherever they are leaving from, must leave between 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock in the morning. That is to allow the Military to pre-position an ambulance along the way. So as the buses were going down, you can shift the ambulances so that if there is an accident that happens, the ambulance is quite close- by to respond. So, the response time to an accident is faster and hopefully, saves lives if there is an accident. Hopefully we do not go there for accident. My question to the honourable Minister is, will you consider or are you considering setting up a taskforce with relevant agencies specifically to target the reduction of road fatalities? We question the police on this issue when we dealt with the two Annual Reports that we tabled yesterday. They told us that they have 18 speeding cameras only for the whole of Fiji. Speaking of speeding cameras, the speeding detection devices, a special task force set up by the relevant agencies and you give them and say, “seek the reduction of this” maybe a better way, rather than just dealing it with business as usual. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, that was a lengthy supplementary question or is it a statement? HON. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The short answer is, yes. As I had mentioned, the working group is currently in place and they are all working together to address those. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Forgive me, Sir, I might need a minute extra on my supplementary. It is not an explanation, it is an offering. MR. SPEAKER.- You are giving an explanation followed by a question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is an offering to the honourable Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Offer, that is great.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> In my capacity as Patron of the Fiji Motorcycle Association, Sir, I just received a message from the Association. We have previously assisted the LTA with road safety awareness. MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the wild group? (Laughter) HON. F. S. KOYA.- That is in the words of honourable Tikoduadua. We are a good bunch, Sir. We are offering our assistance in any way we can. We have done so previously to raise awareness for it, please, just contact me, just message me and we will absolutely and greatly help because the carnage is too much. Just to put it into perspective, Sir, if you travelling on a motorcycle at 80 kilometres an hour and you hit a pothole, you are in for a serious ride. So, it is quite bad and I am happy to hear that the</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1915 honourable Minister has agreed with respect to what was just mentioned regarding a taskforce. Please, include us in the taskforce. My question, honourable Minister, is there a specific reason at the moment why we do not have enough going out in the media with respect to road safety? I ask you to think about what New Zealand does., there are quite some really hard hitting messages that go out at the movies, on TV and even our billboards. It really does help, is there a specific reason why we are not seeing that at the moment or is there something in the pipeline that will happen shortly, Sir? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, I think the issue goes back in terms of what happened to the National Road Safety Council (NRSC). This was established in 1994, however, due to unplanned and cost saving measures, this was merged into LTA and also increased the functions of LTA to incorporate that of the National Road Safety Council. I believe this has diluted the work of NRSC and this is why we are relooking at that to re-establish it. There is no point in pointing at each other, but the point is to look at solutions. That is why we are relooking at that. The main function of LTA is registration and licensing, so there is a need to re-focus road safety specifically to an institution which is empowered and also funded as mentioned to the specific function of road safety which is very important. That is another thing we are looking at in terms of NRSC to move us forward. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for about 40 minutes to 50 minutes so you may enjoy your tea. I have been given to understand that some honourable Members have come directly here without having a proper breakfast. We have been raising questions about accountability and we worry about what have we done, so the Secretariat and I are worried too.</p><h4>We are adjourning Parliament for about 40 minutes to 50 minutes and will resume when the</h4><p>bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.51 a.m.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1916</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 11.25 a.m. Price Control on Items by FCCC (Question No. 140/2023) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament on the steps being undertaken by the Fijian competition and Consumer Commission to ensure fair price marking for basic food items and other goods and services as a result of the change of VAT as announced in the 2023-2024 National Budget? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I would like to thank the honourable Member for raising the question on behalf of honourable Qereqeretabua. Mr. Speaker, we, obviously, inherited a very challenging fiscal position and the complicated VAT regime where we had zero percent, nine percent and 15 percent VAT rates. Of course, we have reduced it to two rates - zero and 15 percent. But we also, Mr. Speaker, ensured that the zero-rated VAT on the existing 21 items, including the addition of prescribed medicine, making it 22 items, despite the advice of the World Bank and Fiscal Review Committee where the suggestion was that we should have a single rate of VAT which would be more efficient and simpler. But as are Government, we decided that we will have two rates and so all those rates of goods and services at 9 percent were raised to 15 percent. Compared to the three rates. this change, Mr. Speaker, made the VAT simpler, eliminated issues of ambiguity around VAT rate application and assisted businesses to better administer and reduce the risk of non-compliance with additional revenues to Government. Mr. Speaker, when we introduced these changes, most of the businesses actually complied well in a very honest manner, but there were some unscrupulous ones that tried to take advantage of the situation. Some of it almost appeared that there was deliberate attempt to make the Government look bad by disproportionately increasing their markups significantly and much more than they increase in the VAT rate. When that happened, we responded very quickly with the help of the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) and the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) and immediately got things under control. Mr. Speaker, the role of FCCC is to ensure that there is a fair price marking for basic food items and other goods and services, and the Act provides for that assessment and determination of prices for controlled goods as well. Many of the assessments and the determination of prices for controlled goods and services are actually contingent upon procurement procedures, landing cost and there are many other factors that determine this. The FCCC will then determine and announce the retail price before the product actually reaches the market. After the prices are declared, Sir, the allowable markup for wholesale and retail trade is specified under the Price Control Order. Sir, several factors contribute to price fluctuations, including but not limited to supplier procurement cost, international freight expenses, duty rates, exchange rates and local clearance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just also point out here that during COVID-19 and even post-COVID, freight costs had gone up significantly, sometimes by three or four times, so a lot of the increases in</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1917 the cost of goods, especially imported goods, were a direct result of the increase in freight cost. So, in the context of the 2023-2024 Budget, the price review was prompted by the increase in the VAT rate which rose from 9 percent to 15 percent, and based on those changes, Sir, the FCCC reviewed and issued determinations for a total of about 5,496 products, with these changes taking effect from 1 st August, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the implementation period, the FCCC corroborated with the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (FRCS), Green Growth Association and businesses to ensure a smooth transition to the new VAT rate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to facilitate the replacement of price stickers on retailers’ shelves, a notice was issued on 27 th July, 2023 for businesses and on 28 th July, 2023 for Government Ministries and Departments. This notice allowed businesses until 14 th August, 2023 to update their product price levels to reflect the revised VAT rates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, importantly, this notice did not affect the implementation of the VAT amendments as of 1 st, August 2023. All businesses were required to accurately apply the new VAT rate. The FCCC, under the Act, Mr. Speaker, conducted surveys to ensure that the enforcement was properly done and that the businesses were compliant and that they were not making undue increases in prices. There were some items or services which already had a VAT rate of 15 percent. We have had complaints that restaurants suddenly increased their prices and they put out notices to say, ‘we are increasing it because the VAT rate is now increased to 15 percent’. But it was already 15 percent, so they were actually increasing it on top of the 15 percent that was already there. The survey that was conducted in the Central Division was 452, Western Division was 595 and Northern Division was 38. There were 364 inspections in the Central Division, 297 in the Western Division and 256 in the Northern Division. Sir, during the inspections (this was a joint, sort of, operation between FRCS and FCCC), it was found that 62 traders were found in breach of these breaches. The FCCC has proceeded for prosecution against two traders and, of course, others are under investigation. As part of phase two, Mr. Speaker, Sir, greater scrutiny will be applied to pharmacies as well, the licensing of which already falls under the FCCC’s responsibility because with the addition of prescribed medication to zero VAT-rated medicine, we want to make sure that it is reflected also in the price that people get when they take the prescribed medication to the Pharmacies. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we noticed from the discussions that we were having, for example, the chicken prices, when we talked to the suppliers, they said, “No, we did not change anything”. The traders who were found to just increasing it in an exorbitant manner were saying, “Oh, somehow, this was directed by the suppliers.” So, there was contradiction in terms of what we were being told. Sir, I would like to reiterate the fact that all those items, as I have said earlier, 15 percent VAT was already there. In fact, as I have said, we have three VAT rates - we had zero VAT, 9 percent and 15 percent. So, the example of restaurants is something that we also found and think some of the traders in the way they increased the prices was not only unethical, but it was also wrong and it almost amounted to deliberate cheating. These traders, Mr. Speaker, will be taken to task by the FCCC. In addition, Sir, we have formed a price surveillance task force comprising of FCCC, FRCS and the Ministry of Finance, to monitor the prices and what we are noticing is that there are traders</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1918</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 who have been very honest. In fact, the FCCC has identified that the prices of almost 230 items have actually down, even after the increase of VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent because freight costs have come down significantly and some of them have quite honestly reflected that in the prices that they had put out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is an update on what the Ministry of Finance, FRCS and FCCC are doing to ensure that there is proper compliance. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Through you, Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister of Finance for that comprehensive answer. My supplementary question would be, while he has actually mentioned that traders would be taken to task, can he provide some clarity with respect to products that are not under price control and the prices are going high and how can that be actually managed? If the prices are not price-controlled, there is no jurisdiction to indicate the percentage margin that a trader can place on a particular product. So, how is the Ministry and FCCC dealing with that? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question. In fact, that is a question that we need to address. The FCCC is looking at its own determinations and what sort of signals they can provide to the traders. Also, I think, Mr. Speaker, there is a need to make sure that there is an appropriate awareness and discussion with the major suppliers to ensure that the price that they put out into the market is reflective, and that they are not making undue profit. For example, in the case of the chicken suppliers - the local producers, they get duty protection of almost 42 percent. And we are saying to the suppliers, “Look, that has been the policy previously as well, so we have not changed any of those”, because we realise the importance of production. If we put together all three of them, they employ about 2,400 people, but they cannot use that to hold 800,000 people to ransom by increasing the price of chicken in an unscrupulous manner when they do not have to. So, that is the signal that we are providing. In my discussion with all of them, they actually said that those prices should not have been increased by that much, and since then, Sir, it has all come down. There are also things happening, for example, powdered milk prices have gone down from between 6 percent to 8 percent, as announced. There is 6 percent and then the maximum increase is about 8 percent, so it is 6 percent to 8 percent of different products. Mr. Speaker, the FCCC, as I have said, said that the actual price of about 230 items went down because post COVID-19, freight costs were coming down. For example, with chicken products, even with the protection of 42 percent, some traders who were importing chicken portions, wings and other products with the payment of 42 percent duty, were able to sell it at a lower price than what was being supplied by the local producers. So that is the kind of situation that happens every now and then, However, what we have said from the Ministry to FRCS is that the effect of the budget should be closely monitored, and I call upon all the traders and retailers. I think by and large, Sir, majority of them are honest players. They do the right thing, and we see that kind of dialogue and campaign in bringing the prices down and making sure that they do it in an ethical manner. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is in light of the fact on how you have explained it that quite a substantial amount of odd numbers in terms of people who went through this fair price exercise and were in breach of it, are actually going to get prosecuted. The question relates to the actual penalty that is going to be imposed on them. Do you intend to have a relook at the penalties imposed?</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1919 I know most businesses are compliant. Those who actually do that are even more of a deterrent with respect to this. In every budget in every year, we do something or another, and they fall foul of it. Is there an avenue for you with respect to deterrence to these operators who are actually doing that? I say this, Mr. Speaker, because at the end of the day, when you have a serious deterrent, it is like the taxi driver in Singapore where he will not cross an orange light because he knows tomorrow morning, he will lose his taxi licence. That is true. So, if the deterrent is there, you will get traders making sure that they are compliant. This is for the benefit of the consumers. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Koya is absolutely right. We probably have to look at the FCCC Act. I think on the deterrent, there has to be some penalty, and I agree with him. At the moment, it seems to me that it is not as clear, and some of it is not there - things like prices, as honourable Maharaj had pointed out, which are not under price control, some traders feel that they can just do whatever they want to do. What we are saying is, if we find that there are certain products where the traders are deliberately making sure that they make big margins, we will have no option but to bring it under price control. But the point that honourable Koya has raised about penalties is very important because there are some who distort the market in a big way. One big supermarket decides to do something funny, then it, sort of, distorts everything else and sometimes people complain that they go to one supermarket, as opposed to another, but there is a big difference. It is also the timing. Sometimes, traders play their games which is alright, but they should not be unscrupulous and unethical by increasing the margin in a big way. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plight of our people in the rural and outer islands. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, you have talked about freight costs coming down, but this is one of the areas that, I would say, is a big contributing factor to the predicament and the extra burden on our people in the rural and outer islands. The two parts to my question, and forgive me for that, are freight costs and the effectiveness of monitoring. We do a good job in urban areas - the municipalities, but it is the monitoring in the rural and outer islands. How are you looking at fixing these issues, honourable Minister? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition. I think that is a very important and critical question and as you know and pointed out quite correctly, in Vanua Levu and some of the maritime islands, it has always been an issue. The freight costs is something that we can look at. When we were discussing the budget in Vanua Levu, there were calls about certain amount of rebates on goods that are shipped from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu. There are also, on the other side, a lot of the producers from Vanua Levu who were complaining about the fact that the freight cost is so high when sending products to Viti Levu, to Suva and to the Western Division where they can fetch better prices. But freight costs sometimes can be quite prohibitive in terms of what they could do. So, I think as part of the next Budget, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we can look at some of the areas or the flashpoints that we can deal with. If there is a requirement for certain policy intervention, Sir, then we would be looking at that as well. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. In fact, our market is so small, there is always the danger of collusion within the business community. We have seen it time and again over the years and it is extremely hard to deal with that matter.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1920</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that countries use different strategies to deal with such situation. A good example is India with such a big market, with a lot of competition, yet they introduced four levels of GST. They introduced 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent. In Fiji’s situation, we had zero percent, 9 percent and 15 percent. The 15 percent was mainly for luxury items, like alcohol, tobacco, white goods, et cetera; 9 percent was purely for food and services such as electricity, water bill, Telecom, so it was 9 percent. That is one way of providing relief to consumers, particularly when we have such challenges. As the honourable Minister has highlighted, I mean, really every government whether you sit this side or that side or we are on either side, it does not matter because we have to make sure that consumers benefit and they are the ones who are struggling. So, honourable Minister, one way of dealing with this issue would be, like as you have mentioned about the marked prices which are displayed in the supermarkets, but if FCCC can also run more programmes or even through their social media just to alert the public what the real price is. That is all, thank you. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Thank you. I mean, I could not agree more with the explanation, except that, in a situation such as Fiji, honourable Kumar, is right, there is a lot of collusion that takes place. It is very hard to deal with it but the fact that when we did the Budget, we assessed the situation. In fact, Mr. Speaker, some of the prices for some of the items as a result of the decrease in the freight cost have come down by as much as about 40 percent. I mean, I have a list that has been provided by FCCC on the various traders. As I have said, for 230 items, some prices have actually gone down and I know people are telling me that the prices have actually come down on basic food products, things like onions, potatoes, tinned fish, and others. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are things happening in the market and we are, sort of, studying that carefully and some of the traders have done that. So, in a sense, the measures that we put into the Budget, we have made it simpler, but we made sure that we also get enough revenue and as a result of that, we have been able to provide increases in social welfare and other areas where we have been able to help those who we feel will be most vulnerable and most significantly affected as a result of the rise in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent. MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move on and before I give the floor to the next question to be raised, I would like to welcome those in the gallery. Thank you for taking an interest in your Parliament and to be here. We welcome you warmly. (Acclamation) Illegal PSV Activities (Question No. 141/2023) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament how the Ministry intends to stop or regularise those private vehicles involved in illegal PSV activities in order to make their business legal, lawful and safe to the public? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. Sir, the answer to the question is with them…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer:</span></p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1921 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- …because the question will also be responded to with this question, what were you doing in the last term? (Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Just answer the question! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of illegal vehicles has been there for a very long time - 16 years. I mean, we have gone through various Ministers of Transport, CEOs of LTA, one was paid more than half a million dollars, and that is why we have brought in the Higher Salaries Commission to control that. (Laughter) So, you know when I saw the question I am asking myself we cannot answer it because you have the answer. What were you doing? (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I mean a lot of us know the story about illegal passenger vehicles and all that. They do satisfy a need. For example, some of the taxis do not run after hours and they are there. People call them from the communities, neighbourhoods … (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Wait, wait! I am still explaining.</p><p>(Laughter) Currently we are going through and you have also gone through the public consultation on that in which we are continuing and there is definitely a need to regularise but the freeze is still there so we are looking at those regulations relating to that but it needs to be look at holistically. I know it is taking a bit of time but when it is done then it is better to do it holistically rather than in a piecemeal. So, just to answer the honourable Member, yes, we definitely need to look at because they are satisfying the certain sector of the public demand but of course we need to put in place measures such as the standards, state of the vehicles, age and of course the training of the drivers, the standards which they need to adhere to. So those are issues we are looking into so we will address one of the problems that you passed on to me. (Laughter) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister said the very right thing here. These pirate taxis are running because they are serving a market. There is a need there but there is a new ball game altogether now. Most of these demands are coming from those that are operating from villages, so I think in order for the Ministry or LTA to do this, probably this is going to be a new re-look into the law that covers the PSV areas but based from villages, from rural. The question now is probably about how we are going to really get the conditions in, just to stop these pirate operators that are coming into town. I think they are already flooding the market in town but there is a need, of course, in the rural or villages. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1922</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 of the situations that we will need to look into. Currently, when we look at the mix system which is the base and the open, we will need to work out whether the base system needs to be adjusted to cater for those who are coming to drop but not to operate near those bases. Somehow, that needs to be rationalised to have that option and not to crowd out those who are based in the municipal bases. We might need to have two separate areas there but the urban or the town area the priority is those who have the bases there but not to deny the public the service if those who are at the base are not there especially during busy periods, Christmas, even Fridays and paydays. That is something we are looking into. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the original answer of the honourable Minister was giving to the other question, I thought if he wanted to give up on the post, he can give it up. I appreciate the answer by the honourable Minister that he is looking into regularising people who drive these private taxis provided they meet the requirements. One of the things I have noticed Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have had on occasion that I have to tell taxi drivers off because sometimes the way they are dressed, sometimes they start playing with their phone while they are driving. It seems to me that once they get their PSVs, they become formal taxi and they get this sense of entitlement. I am just wondering, if you are going to regularise people that are privately pirate taxis, once they get the formalisation, how do you make sure that the problem does not perpetuate? For instance, if you can go to Makoi at night and you find these taxis there. Once they get that taxi permit et cetera, they probably operate during the day, they disappear again at night. I know it is not a hard problem to solve but I am just thinking maybe there should be some sorts of things that LTA might consider on imposing on current PSV holders. I have had a case when I had my grandchildren when the bus stopped at a bus stop, he stopped in the road, not in the bus stop. I had to tell him off, you cannot do that, I have got grandchildren here. He said, no you just get off, we had a big argument. In this sense of entitlement for people that have PSVs or commercial taxis, I hope you might have some idea of how they might try to address this issue. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, thank you. I acknowledge that it is an ongoing problem and as an institution, that is where the PSV training comes, in terms of public service. That is a component which is currently being looked into in terms of the provision of licence, the responsibility which needs to go within the compliance and the standards of dress and Code of Behaviour in terms of PSV not only that but also having a framework to monitor that and also have in place measures to pull up those who are not abiding with that Code of Behaviour.
