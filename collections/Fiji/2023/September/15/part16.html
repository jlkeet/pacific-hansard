<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE END OF WEEK STATEMENTS HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are seeing an economy that has rebounded strongly and the momentum is expected to continue.... (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-...the labour market has recovered strongly and the tight market is naturally pushing up wages which is benefiting our workers.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very slow:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> We are looking at more reforms to entice new investments and new sectors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that will create more and better paying jobs. The Government has generally provided a renewed sense of optimism and confidence to our investor community. We can see that quiet evidently, we are in the process of reversing some of the policies, for example just this week we have reversed the policy on retirement age of local government workers from 55 years to 60 years and in the next calendar year, the people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will know about the review process with respect to the National Living Minimum Wage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion let me say that honourable Sharma’s statement was based on generalisation without any evidence, he linked crime rate to this and that... (Chorus interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-...so it was all over the place. The Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is firmly focused on looking after our most vulnerable, the policies announced in the 2023-2024 Budget and as I said earlier the Government is firmly in control of the situation. We want to assure the people of this country that no one is going to be left behind in terms of the policies that the Government has pursued as part of our Budget and what we will pursue in the future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Labour Mobility HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you, for giving me the opportunity to talk on the important topic of labour mobility. A lot of us have been talking about it for some time now. I think during the end of last year and at the beginning of this year, there were lots of concerns about the issue of labour mobility. Labour mobility, as we all know, is just about geographical movement of labour, or people working and moving from one area to another, or occupational movement, where people move from one occupation to another. We know that it is always a function of supply and demand. If a certain area in a country or a certain type of business want certain people, there is a lot of demand, then people will move towards that type of occupation. So that happens all over.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023 End of Week Statements 1931 Sometimes that supply and demand, people are prepared to move to one country or one place to another because there is a demand from the other side, and sometimes, some people under the lower scale might be thinking, “I should move because last year, before I voted, I was promised $5 per hour and all of a sudden when the Government comes in, the people who said they are going to raise the minimum wage rate to $5, did not do it, and that does not happen.” Then they will realise, that is hypocrisy. “I am promised something, as soon they get into Government, they talk about hypocrisy, but they do not deliver it after nine months in office. Maybe I should pack up my bags and go.” Maybe those are some of the ways that people have been thinking. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those sorts of supply and demand issues are something that compel or push labour mobility. Also, in other countries there are aging societies, where a lot more people are older and they are not producing enough people to replace their labour supply. We have all these things happening, the growth of globalisation and in some of these countries a lot of their workers have become lazy. One of the things we see now is that, a lot of our workers who are going to Australia, are going into the areas where Australians themselves do not want to go - the rural areas. That may be because, they have a lot of welfare, so to assist the people who are unemployed, which means they still earn money that makes them lazy to go and do the work, they need people to come from other countries, and this is something you will find all over the world. People go from one country to another to do a particular kind of employment, it is a flow, and other people come in to replace them from somewhere else. So there is a constant movement of people in this whole issue of labour mobility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour mobility is not something new in Fiji. Over the past few decades, and past few 100 years, we might say that even within Fiji, we have seen mobility. People are moving from rural areas to urban areas, around different parts of Fiji. People changing jobs from one job to another in Suva or moving from Lautoka to Suva or Labasa to Suva. The mass migration from Labasa to Suva is an example of labour mobility over the years, and people are beginning to change occupations. We have seen, for instance, these past few years, people who are formally qualified to become teachers or professionals have been moving out leaving one occupation to another. This morning when I came into the office, I met one of my good friends here, who was vacuum cleaning, because, as you have mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of people in this Parliament, your staff are doing three jobs at once, because people have moved out of Parliament. Those are the kinds of things that we are finding in Fiji. These are some of the trends that we have seen. Labour mobility has been exacerbated over the past few years to a large extent by people with lower-level types of jobs, especially, with the surge in this seasonal employment programmes, particularly, in Australia and New Zealand. Over the past few years, we have seen the development of Recognise Seasonal Employment Programme, the Seasonal Workers Programme, the Pacific Labour Scheme and now we have the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme, coupled with the eHub Programme in which Australia allows people to come and study and work at the same time. The vast numbers of our people have gone onto this particular programme. So, it has been exacerbated over the past few years. So, you have this internal mobility within the country and then you have the mobility offshore. A lot of our people have been moving for a long time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think honourable Ravunawa came back from Mongolia and he met about 30 teachers, people who teach English in Mongolia, interesting. I know that we have our people in Japan who are teaching English and other things, we know that all over the Pacific, our professionals are taking up a lot of jobs all over the Pacific so there is a demand for these skills from Fiji. Fiji has become what the Australians used to be in the Pacific - we have sort of taken over that role. We are providing the specialist people as</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1932 End of Week Statements 15 th Sept., 2023 experts in different fields to various countries all over the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have been listening to the debates and what we have been talking about in Parliament this week, there was a comment I think earlier when we were talking about something on those airports in Nadi or Civil Aviation, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka and Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica highlighted the loss of our aviation experts in CAAF because of their abilities and capabilities. There have been demands for their service, so they have moved out over the years. There was earlier this week a question on the loss of nurses in the health sector. The nurses are not only moving within the country one of the reason is because we are saying our growing private sector health establishment especially around Nadi and parts of Suva. So you can see there are more opportunities for these nurses and they begin to move around. It gives opportunities for them but it also creates problems from the places that they are leaving, to their initial places of employment. There was a question on the loss of nurses and I think if I am not mistaken honourable Deputy Prime Minister Prof. Biman Prasad mentioned earlier this week that we have lost 10 percent of our workforce on Tuesday but I am not too sure what that timeline is. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Last 18 months HON. J. USAMATE.- Last 18 months which is a big number, so it is a big number of people that are moving from one part of Fiji to the next and I also saw the written question that was done by honourable Pio Tikoduadua about the number of people that have left from 1 st January to 31 st August this year - 3,650 left for education and training, 5,552 for employment and 1,946 for migrating. So, the numbers are quite substantive in terms of people moving around all over the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not totally a bad thing, there are a lot of good benefits that will come out of this. Remittances have really grown, remittances if my figures are correct here, I was looking at a report from the UN World Food Programme where they are telling us that in 2022 the remittances had reached about $1.04 billion which amounts to about 9.4 percent of nominal GDP. Almost one-tenth of the total wealth that we have in this country comes from the work of people that are offshore, one-tenth that is a significant amount. They have noticed also in that programme that in the first months of this year once again I think the amount of money that is coming from remittances if I am not mistaken for the month of March was more than it was the previous year. So, it is increasing, the trend is increasing which is a reflection maybe that there are more leaving. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- $700 million… HON. J. USAMATE.- So, these are the kinds of things that are happening and that I think is one of the positive effects of labour mobility. There are some countries in the world who actually target labour mobility. If you go all over the world you will find people in the Philippines they have a national setup where they get people trained specifically to go and work overseas and I think you have seen that from Kiribati we have our sailors all over the world. They have these setups. They go for each; they push for it. I think maybe one of the reason for that is the level of unemployment they might be having in their own countries. That is one way we can look at labour mobility because we can see the actual benefit from it. I think in Fiji we have not really decided to pursue this kind of overseas labour mobility like they have done in the Philippines, and I think there is going to be a key question for government to ponder about our reaction and our approach to this because we also are aware of the negative impacts</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023 End of Week Statements 1933 of labour mobility. Of course, the money that comes in has an impact on the families, has an impact on the people that live here but there are also negative impacts. I heard some of our friends talking about this side of the Parliament we are talking about the fact that now it is becoming increasingly hard to get people who are sales reps, merchandisers, customers officers who are customer service officers. So, when there is shortage of these people we are beginning to see wage inflation in some of these occupations. If you want a certain person with a certain skill you have to increase the amount of money that you pay that can have an impact on our society - wage inflation, shortage of skills so there is a need for us to be able to address the negative impacts of this labour mobility. So, on the one hand you have the benefits and on the other hand you have the negative impacts of it and of course, sometimes you have the social problems that come with it. There is something that we need to ponder in Fiji. We must have ways (Government and us combined) that we can benefit from the positive impacts and at the same time, minimise the negative impacts - the shortage of skills, the social issues that come with it. I think the question for us in Fiji is to decide how we are going to work with this labour mobility issue. Labour mobility is like a river, and you cannot stop it. We cannot say that we pull out of it because it is peoples’ right - if they want to work somewhere else for them to go but as a country, as a nation and as a Government, we need to be able to manage it so that we can benefit from its benefits and minimise the negative impacts that it has on our country. I look forward to the Government coming forward to suggest ways we can work together to try to answer these questions and address these issues. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the honourable Usamate for answering half of the contribution I was supposed to make - he has already covered half of it. We all know, there are two sides to a coin - the negatives and the positives. He has described the positive, and he also described the negative, but the thing is planning and doing things better. When we say this in any country is very important to have a Human Resources Development Plan (HRDP). A Human Resources Development Plan is done by getting the stakeholders together. When the stakeholders come together, the employers’ federation, the education providers, the training providers all come together - we look at our needs, plan our needs and then we train our people. I must say that our problem in past years has been (and I will just look at one sector - education) through the Loan Scheme people got all sorts of qualifications which were already flooded in the job market. And then there were subject areas where there were no teachers so there was hardly any planning done, people just went, chose their course, and did it. What we are doing now through our scholarship scheme is to make sure that there are categories of people entering the tertiary institutions including the skills, trades and then going up to engineering and the rest of it. That is the way to go inasfar as planning and preparing your human capital is concerned. The second issue of course, the positive side of labour mobility as honourable Usamate has alluded to, is that it has been there for hundreds of years ever since we can remember, and it will continue to be there. Some countries have gained a lot through exporting labour, and we are in that business now. Our people are going, we are getting remittances. It is important for us to make sure that our people who go out there and get jobs especially on work permits, are treated fairly; and are given minimum terms and conditions equal to the people of the country that they are working in - the locals), that is very important. Also, we want to see that when they come back, they come back with some added skills, and they are able to better contribute. We have seen these examples where our people have gone, work and come back - they have improved their standard of living for their families and that is a very positive move.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1934 Heritage Bill 2023 15 th Sept., 2023 Those who migrate, of course, they leave those gaps I have alluded to how we must fill those gaps and the honourable Minister for Education has yesterday very aptly described how the Ministry is planning to develop the Education sector to make sure that the tertiary institutions are providing the right type of education, right from skills to professionals. The Education Summit is going to address those issues, so these are the plans we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we will continue with this conversation as we go along.</p></body>
