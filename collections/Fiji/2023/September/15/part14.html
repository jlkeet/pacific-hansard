<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with a 10-minute response time by the Minister or Ministers responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech. No seconder is required and there will be no further debate. Honourable Members, I now call on honourable Rinesh Sharma to deliver his End of the Week Statement. Increase of National Minimum Wage HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I start, last night when I left Parliament, my vehicle had an issue. I would like to sincerely thank those Police Officers who approached and helped me out and I safely got home. I would like to sincerely thank them, there were 10 of them who came up last night. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the End of Week Statements on the matter of increasing of minimum wage rate, this to be reviewed. The Statement would highlight the increase in cost of living and why there is a need to increase the National Minimum Wage Rate for our people as it is a very pressing issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thousands of Fijians will agree with me, I can keep my hand on my heart and confidently say, that this Coalition Government is like a sinking Titanic in radioactive waters. The wage rate in Fiji, Fiji’s first ever National Minimum Wage Rate was introduced in 2014 for unskilled workers at $2 an hour. Since then, the rate has been increased twice, first to $2.32 an hour in 2015 and then again at $2.68 an hour in 2017. Following a national wide consultation process, the National Minimum Wage Rate will now be increased to $4 per hour in four trenches. The subsequent or gradual increase is taking a realistic approach. Effective from 1 st April, 2022, the National Minimum Wage Rate increased from $2.68 to $3.01 an hour and further increased to $3.34 per hour in July 2022, and then to $3.67 per hour. Finally, $4 per hour by January 2023; subsequent and gradual increase. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen some honourable Members on the other side, they have said previously about $5 wages immediately as a package that will be done for the people of this country, but then 15 percent VAT was imposed on our people. We have a very historic Coalition Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring our attention to the honourable Minister of Finance because we have him on record saying that the cost of living is too high, and VAT is high as well. He also said that businesses are compliant and freight cost is coming down, but our goal is to provide 2 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 145/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and and Social Protection under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure II.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023 End of Week Statements 1925 for the people and that is our loyalty. But the businesses’ loyalty is their profits. Businesses will still, most of them actually will still keep the prices same or even increase their profits, despite the VAT increase, and that is why cost of living is very high. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 24 th March, 2022, again, the honourable Minister of Finance said that he estimates that 50 percent of the Fijians are struggling to put food on the table. Coming to this year, the Coalition Government speaks about the importance of public consultations. Of course, it is very important, but I ask the people of this country if the cost of living is high and an increase in VAT is what you wanted? We have seen the outcomes of the National Economic Summit, there were various consultations and what was the outcome? The cost of living is high, because this is a collective issue. Thousands of Fijians are having difficulties to meet basic necessities, and thousands of Fijians are struggling to buy food, water, clothes, health and sanitation items. The struggle of the Fijian people is real under the Coalition Government, knowing that we have just come out of a pandemic. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farmers are struggling. Some students who were on TELS have messaged me and shared their pressing concerns. To my surprise, some have left their studies and are working. Some are studying and working till late at night. Some said that they can afford only one or two light meals per day. I encourage academic challenges for the youth of this country, but here, the students are in a survival challenge. How do we survive and still move on in life and build life? This is the state that our young people are living in right now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people are also concerned and worried, they cannot afford food and neither can they get food from the ocean. What do they eat? Where do they go? And like I said previously, na idhar ke, na udhar ke - this is where the people are left to be. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijian families are being pushed into a pool of poverty with a high cost of living. Poverty has many dimensions, but its cause include unemployment, social exclusion, high vulnerability of certain population or communities to disasters, diseases which is another phenomena which prevents them from being productive. We are very grateful we have not seen a natural disaster. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many reasons but in short because as human beings, our wellbeing is linked to each other and growing in equality is detrimental to the economic growth and undermine social cohesion, increasingly political and social tension and in some circumstances driving instability and conflict. The high cost of living has obviously and realistically increased the crime rate. In the pursuit to steal and feed yourself, people have ended up in a battle with the person they are trying to rob and actually an act of violence and some people have lost their lives. If I can remember, a senior citizen in Vuda was stabbed by the person trying to rob a house and yesterday I heard in Koronivia that someone has been murdered. These are the real issues our people are facing. Sir, EFL and Water Authority have put in submissions to FCCC to review the tariff rate. This will be an added burden with the VAT increase. Parents are struggling to feed their children especially their babies. Sir, SMA milk is $31.50, S26 (Step 1) is $50, S26 (Step 2) is around $52.95; extremely expensive conditions we are living in and not all babies can drink Red Cow Milk because most end up vomiting and get sick. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Fijians are forced to be living on products like tinned tuna, high number of sodium and loaves of bread. If you go for white bread, that is bleached flour; when you go for white sugar that is bleached sugar. This contributes to the NCDs which will put pressure on our</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1926 End of Week Statements 15 th Sept., 2023 health system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this raises the question that when our health is in danger and if one cannot feed themselves with the high cost of living under this Coalition Government, in what capacity will the Fijian people be able to afford medication? A broken heart, an empty stomach and an empty wallet teaches you a lot in life. It can make one do unimaginable things but here our Coalition Government has achieved all three. People said, “change is here” - all right. Your government, but they have increased the cost of living, and this has broken people’s hearts and hopes. The high cost of living, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has caused people not being able to afford meals, here you end up with an empty stomach and the high cost of living is where Fijians have to drain and empty their wallets. The primary purpose of reviewing the increase of minimum wage as soon as possible is to provide our hard-working Fijian workers with a level of income that allows them to meet their essential needs. It acts as a safeguard against the high cost of living and helps reduce poverty and income inequality within our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is moving forward, but they are moving forward just like a person running on a treadmill. They are running but they are at the same place. On behalf of our thousands of struggling Fijians and Fijian families, I sincere ask the Coalition Government to stop focusing on fulfilling the Coalition Agreement and focus on the people of Fiji by reviewing the National Minimum Wages. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the concerns of our people matter, the voices of our people matter, the livelihoods of our people matter. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government does not move the economy, it is the Fijian people, and this will only happen if they are given the buying power. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I would like to urge the Government to review the National Minimum Wage because it is an achievement both sides of Parliament will celebrate because the people of this country will be the ones winning. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his statement. As I have said during my Budget Response, there is a very well-fitting Hindi saying that describes the Opposition strategy or maybe should I say Opposition hypocrisy in Parliament for the last seven months especially on the issue of minimum wage and the saying, Mr. Speaker, is ulta chor kotwal ko daante or the thief blaming the Police. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- One of the worst examples of hypocrisy, coming from a Member of a party that was in Government, eroded workers’ rights and nullified collective agreements between the unions that represented them and the employers which the Coalition Government is and will restore, and give true meaning to collective bargaining and not minimum wage but a living wage. Mr. Speaker, honourable Sharma needs to be reminded that it took the Bainimarama government eight years to just even introduce a National Minimum Wage and that of only $2 just prior to the 2014 elections. Then, Mr. Speaker, it took another eight long years for the FijiFirst Government to gradually raise the minimum wage to $4 per hour. Again, not surprisingly it was an election year…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> 2012 we started.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023 End of Week Statements 1927</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> … and that is where we are right now.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, we have an Opposition in Parliament which in government until last December ruled with an iron fist in respect of trampling upon workers’ rights and just wages. Now, Mr. Speaker, they are shedding crocodile tears trying to be the champion of workers. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- One wonders whether an Opposition Member of Parliament who engages workers who are unskilled, work on casual basis and even pays the basic minimum wage rate of $4 an hour. In fact, we are verifying this information.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, these are the same people who deprived our workers off their fundamental rights, the same people who destroyed the successful tripartite arrangement that we have had in Fiji for many years, the same group who terrorised our workers representatives and leaders and the same people, Mr. Speaker, they looted the workers by forcing them to use their FNPF funds during the pandemic.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Yet, they now want to come here and lecture us about just and fair minimum wages. This is hypocrisy of the highest order that I am talking about. Mr. Speaker, it is us who have in fact advocated for a just and fair living wage for our people. In fact, it was our endless pressure on them when they were in government that led to the FijiFirst finally raising the minimum wage rate in 2022 in four tranches to $4. During the 2018 election campaign, the NFP as well as SODEPLA at that time, we advocated for a living wage of $5 and hour. However, Mr. Speaker, this is a truth, we were ridiculed throughout the country by then FijiFirst government with the charge led by the former Attorney-General and Minister for Economy who accused us of trying to bankrupt the economy and forced the closure of large businesses. Meetings were organised in garment factories by the textile and footwear industries where the former Attorney-General campaigned amongst workers and threatened that if they vote for NFP, if they vote for Biman Prasad or SODELPA, and if the NFP and SODELPA came into government and implemented the living wage of $5 an hour, everyone will lose their jobs. We were also accused of playing politics when we stated that the NFP would increase the list of zero-rated items and lower duties on the food products. That was always our policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to increase the minimum and to zero rate VAT on a much larger list of essential items than the six items that they had in the past. HON. K. K. LAL.- How about the 15 percent VAT, people are suffering. Shame on you! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You will see that in the NFP Manifesto in 2018, we had campaigned for that. HON. K. K. LAL.- People are suffering honourable Biman! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Fear mongering, crusade to scare workers of job losses,</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1928 End of Week Statements 15 th Sept., 2023 spreading fear that businesses will close and economy would be destroyed, with hyper inflation and unemployment worked for them in 2018. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Tell them, tell them! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just prior to 2022 election, when they realised that they were about to lose the elections, suddenly they announced an increase in minimum wage to $4 and zero- rated 21 items.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> You are there because of SODELPA, do not fly high.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they picked up the whole list that we had provided in our manifesto without even changing it. We definitely liked that, they copied our policy but we definitely have no time for such hypocrisy that is coming from the other side. We know that they are on the other side, but in fact, honourable Sharma should realise that he is part of a party that actually betrayed the nation, our people and workers in this country. Soon, we are systematically since we have come into Government in the last seven months… HON. K. K. LAL.- Where is the $5 minimum wage, when will you introduce it? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- …we have restored the workers’ rights, there is optimism, there is freedom… HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen, listen! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … and unions and employers are working together. We have always championed workers’ rights and the tripartite approach to dealing with labour issues. In the 2023-2024 Budget, the Coalition Government clearly announced the review of the current minimum wage of $4, we clearly announced it. We want our workers to receive a fair and just living wage through a proper consultative process. Let me repeat this, the Coalition Government is determined to ensure our workers receive a fair and just living wage that is agreed to by all stakeholders through a proper and genuine consultative process, not in an haphazard manner or imposed on the workers or just before the election. I have frequently elaborated on our grave economic woes resulting from the recklessness of the previous government. It is because of their gross economic mismanagement that we have inherited a large public debt which had to be dealt with immediately. (Honourable Members interject) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- A crippled infrastructure requiring urgent attention and a divided society that has to be reunited. The Government basically had very limited choice because of the mess we inherited. We acted quickly and decisively to tackle the debt problem. We had no choice but to increase taxes. Otherwise, the consequences of running into a debt crisis would have collapsed our economy and people would have suffered more badly for a much longer time. We had to take the bitter pill to cure the disease, otherwise surgery at a later stage would have been more difficult than painful. While we try to address the debt problem, we made sure that our vulnerable are protected. Let me point this out, we increased our social welfare payments by 25 percent for those above the age of 70 years and by 15 percent for those between 60 years and 69 years. The budget for the</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>15 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>1929 Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection was increased from $147.7 million to $200.2 million; an increase of $52.5 million which benefitted more than 90,000 people who are now getting increased monthly allowances. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our first few weeks in Government, the honourable Prime Minister and the Government delivered a $200 Back-to-School payment per child from households with an income of less than $50,000 benefitting over 223,000 children at a cost of $45 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have again provided $45 million to continue with this initiative for the 2024 school year. We have written $650 million in TELS, thanks to our Coalition partner, SODELPA, in bringing this policy. For over 53,000 students this means their families, the students will have more income, Sir, because it is not going to... (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-..that is another measure in the Budget. We gave justice to FNPF workers which had their contracts terminated unilaterally and their pensions reduced. So what we have done effective from August 2023, these FNPF Pensioners are now able to access the Government Social Pension Allowance of $125 if they are above the age of 70... MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, would I ask that you pause for a while, while we try and address this housekeeping issue. Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with Standing Order with respect to the sitting time and I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move her suspension motion.</p></body>
