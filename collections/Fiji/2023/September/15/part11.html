<body><h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3><h4>SPEAKER’S RULING</h4><p>Honourable Members, on Thursday 30 th July, 2023, I informed Parliament of two things, that: 1. 2. I had approved honourable Bala’s request to present his evidence on Monday. 11 th September, 2023; and I had received official communication from honourable Sashi Kiran on a matter of prima facie breach of Parliamentary Privilege by the honourable Member, that is, honourable Parveen Bala, and that I would address the matter at a later date. Honourable Members, I will now address Parliament on my: 1. 2. 3. Ruling on the evidence submitted by honourable Bala; Instruction on the matter raised by honourable Sashi Kiran; and Ruling on the official communication from honourable Ketan Lal with respect to the alleged breach of privilege by honourable Charan J. Singh. Submission of Evidence – Hon. P. K. Bala Honourable Members, having reviewed and assessed the evidence submitted by the honourable Bala, I am satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to support the statement he made in the Parliament. Therefore, I hereby rule that the matter will not be referred to the Privileges Committee and this is the end of this matter. Matter of Privilege - Hon. S. Kiran Honourable Members, the official communication from honourable Sashi Kiran on a matter of prima facie breach of Parliamentary Privilege by honourable Parveen Bala, please, kindly take note that I have instructed for legal opinion and, therefore, I will deliver my Ruling on the matter at a later date. Honourable Members, for your information and I seek your forbearance on this, it takes a while to get an opinion because of the so many cases that are before the Solicitor-General’s Office. I hope you will bear with that because it is quite a prolonged case, just to await for legal opinion to come through so as to ensure that we are always transparent in what we do. Breach of Privilege - Hon. C. J. Singh On another matter, honourable Members, I have received official notification on Tuesday, 12 th September, 2023 from honourable Ketan Lal, raising a matter of privilege pursuant to Standing Order 134. The matter of privilege is against the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry with respect to his comment when responding to a question on Monday, 11 th September, 2023, where he referred to honourable Lal as a “bloody small kid”. Honourable Members, I have duly perused the Uncorrected Daily Hansard of Monday, 11 th September, 2023, specifically on page 1631 and on the face of the uncorrected transcript, I am satisfied that honourable Singh uttered those words.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1904</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th Sept., 2023 In that respect, I hereby rule that honourable Singh must withdraw the words, “bloody small kid”, and I further rule that the matter will not be referred to the Privileges Committee. I now call on the honourable Singh to withdraw the words, “bloody small kid”.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I withdraw that comment.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you:</span> That statement is withdrawn, honourable Lal, and honourable Members of the Opposition. Please take note that, that is the end of the matter.</p></body>
