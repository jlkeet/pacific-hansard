LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move: Under Standing Order 6 that so much of Standing Orders 23(1) be suspended so as to allow the Parliament to sit beyond 12.30 p.m. today so we can complete the remaining items on todayâ€™s Order Paper.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I do not anticipate we will be sitting much longer as we have only one more item on the Order Paper and that is the Consideration of Bills which I believe has been supported by both side of Parliament. I beg the indulgence of honourable Members to stay on a little bit longer, understand there are those that need to leave and travel back home or to other commitments but I ask Parliament to support this motion so that we can complete the last remaining item on the Order Paper. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion, if any. Since there is none, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply if any as well. HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing further. Thank you.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1930 End of Week Statements 15 th Sept., 2023 Question put.
