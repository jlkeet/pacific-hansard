<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to the final sitting for today. I also welcome all who are joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. International Day of Democracy Honourable Members, today we celebrate the International Day of Democracy - a momentous occasion that invites us to contemplate the bedrock principles of democracy and their enduring significance. This important day was established through a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007 and has been observed annually on 15 th September since 2008. This year’s International Day of Democracy theme, “Empowering the Next Generation”, focusses on the essential role of children and young people in safeguarding democracy today and in the future. As we celebrate this day, let us be resolute in our commitment to democracy. My appeal to all Fijians is to engage with Parliament and take advantage of the opportunities that are available, so as to participate meaningfully in decision-making. Back to Office Reports For the information of honourable Members, the Back to Office Report for the Parliamentary Whip’s Workshop which was held at the Victorian Parliament will be made available in the Library for your perusal and reference. On that note, I just wanted to add this yellow and red card. That is something that is being</p><p>15 th Sept., 2023 Speaker’s Ruling 1903 practised in the State Parliament of Victoria, so you can always fall on that should there be differences in interpretation or meaning for the impact that it may have on some, if they want to ask where do we pull this from. We did not pull it from the rugby field, it is from a similar State Government of Victoria.</p></body>
