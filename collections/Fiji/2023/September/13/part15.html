<body><h3>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</h3><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, I move: That Parliament agrees to the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission by the Government to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling and confront fears in view of conflicting statements and utterances regarding motives behind the political upheavals so that closure and healing for Fiji is achieved and permanently put to rest this unfortunate and turbulent chapter of our independent history.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of this august Parliament and people of our beloved nation; ni sa bula vinaka saka, sab ko mera pranam. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is long awaited. Our honourable Prime Minister has promised the setting up of this all-important Commission for very good reasons as I tried to articulate this in this motion. I am grateful and honoured that I have been asked by the honourable Prime Minister and the Coalition Government to move this motion in the hope that it may become a significant step towards our national building. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it is our hope that the Coalition Government’s task of rebuilding Fiji together for our future will reach greater heights after the work of this Commission. National Prayer and Reconciliation Programme initiated by the President of the Methodist Church during the Girmit Commemoration and participation of leaders and various faith groups in the event indicate that our people are ready for a healing process. Mr. Speaker, all three Parties in the Coalition Government are firm in their commitment to see to their establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It is long overdue, Sir, but it is better late than never. Some may ask whether this is the time for it. Some may say we should focus on cost of living and on better public services, and I understand that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know from many long years of personal engagement with our people, there are a lot of people that are hurting. There are many unresolved issues that need closure. Can we be a prosperous society if we live in fear and insecurity, if we do not trust our neighbours and carry wounded hearts, Mr. Speaker? Our nation has been plagued by political upheaval since 1987. Officially, we have had four coups including that of 2000 and 2006. But other events have also caused pain and misery to many. Each time we recovered and tried to move forward with the hope that political upheaval should become a thing of the past, sometimes we seem to make progress. The creation of the 1997 Constitution was a time when all sides of this House came together under the leadership of the man who was then and is</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1799 again now our Prime Minister together with the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy. The House voted unanimously for a new form of government and new ways of leadership. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, this was not to last but this is not a time to dwell on that issue. Mr. Speaker, the sad events which have plagued our history themselves pass into history and after then, each time our economy has recovered. Sometimes we create new legal regime and we all try to move forward but we are also avoiding some hard truths, we are not looking deep inside ourselves to learn the lessons of the past. It is easier to look away from the painful events and perhaps pretend that they did not happen but constant echoes of divide, narratives of the past remind us that there are deep rooted wounds in many hearts unable to heal. Some of us can look away and pretend but when we do this, we forget the pain and suffering of those who cannot. The destruction of lives and careers, displacement from homes and physical and mental trauma and these are passed down generations through painful narratives, keeping us trapped in inter- generational trauma; not all of us can move on. We need to come together as a nation to give true meaning to truth telling and achieving genuine reconciliation, helping our current, past and future generations to heal. Reconciliation is a process of healing of relationships that require public truth sharing, apology and commemoration that acknowledges and redresses past harms and violations. Its focus is to replace fear with a sense of security and peaceful coexistence, to build confidence and trust and to develop empathy. Co-existence, trust and empathy has to develop between the individuals who are connected as victims, beneficiaries and perpetrators. We have to create safe spaces for sharing our stories, we have to ensure all sections of our society are engaged including our women, young and elders and there is continuity to ensure healing and closure and narratives that help us move forward as a nation. Reconciliation requires political will, joint leadership, trust building, accountability and transparency. We, in this House were entrusted less than one year ago with the votes of people exercising their democratic rights, the right to choose their leaders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether we are in the government or opposition, here we are all leaders. We are here because others put their trust in us. That is why I hope that we will see our way unanimously to bring into being this Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This is not easy, it requires us to become vulnerable, to tell our truth, to engage in dialogue with people we are not comfortable with, to be able to listen to them with an open mind and open heart without judgement, with humility and with empathy. We have to give to those who have hurt us an honest chance to engage with us, to share honestly with them the impact of their actions on us. We also need to explore how we have dealt with our hurts; hurt people, hurt people. We need to acknowledge and reflect on our own words and actions, engage honestly and allow time and process to heal. This will not be easy but healing and growth is never easy. We must do this, we cannot pass the pain and resentment of the present generation to those of the future. We cannot burden their innocence with our past. There are many lessons to learn from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, Canada, Sri Lanka and closer to home, Solomon Islands. Our Commission will have to take into account our cultural context and may have to have Fijian flavour. But let us be clear about one thing. This is not about one community forgiving or seeking forgiveness from another, this is not about divisions of race, religion or province even though those elements play a strong part in it, this is about each of us as human beings with all honesty to look deep into our hearts and confront the things that we have done which may have caused deep loss or hurt to others, people of other ethnic groups but also of our own. Race is not the only fault lying in our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the civil unrest in 2000, I was part of a trauma healing and peaceful</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>1800 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 initiative lead by Father Frank Hoare, an outstanding Columbian priest who has now been in Fiji for 50 years. Through this process I was trained to be a peace facilitator. I joined the team for trauma healing in the Northern Division. Our first facilitation was held in Savusavu. Our workshop created a space for many factions to come together. There were rebels, members of the security forces and villagers. They were all angry with the other; all angry and hurt. I did not facilitate that session but what observed taught me new realities. For the first time I saw that indigenous people considered themselves victims of the crisis while many of us Indo-Fijians saw them as perpetrators. After a week long process, raw emotions and many tears, we realised that we were scratching the surface and there was a need for a deeper process. As we travelled to Dreketi, Bua, Macuata and Wainikoro, we saw many indigenous people in confusion. Some had lost their Indo-Fijian tenants and wanted them back. They had lost, not just economic relationships but personal friendships. We met Indo-Fijian tenants who felt they had no sense of security and were packing to leave. We also met indigenous youth who were embroiled in the civil unrest, taken to task by security forces, confused because they said they only had done what the elders told them to do. We met chiefs who said they thought they were fighting for a cause and were suddenly left high and dry to face the consequences on their own. I saw similar sentiments in Ra and Tailevu, making me an Indo-Fijian realise there are a lot of unresolved issues within the indigenous community also. When we had sessions with our armed forces, I realised that those who served as trusted peacekeepers carry many burdens of trauma from their assignments and personal losses that go unacknowledged. I have listened to soldiers deeply affected by the 2000 mutiny. These emotions remain raw more than two decades later and needs a process enclosure. Mr. Speaker, there is much more I can talk about here. I have not talked about the divisions within the Indo-Fijian community. The minority communities such as the Melanesians, some of whom still struggle with their sense of place and identity. But these are the things that do not belong here. They belong to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that I hope we will all endorse and support. Mr. Speaker, this is such a beautiful nation in every way. Despite the differences, our people standby each other, not only during sports and festivals and joyous times but through every disaster we go through. Our own identities are inter-twined. As Fijians, we are incomplete without the presence of the others. Only when we are able to heal and genuinely accept and love the other, we will truly have Fiji the way the world should be. We owe it to our future generations, Mr. Speaker, and I commend the motion. May God bless Fiji with peace and prosperity. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Right now, I have a list of three speakers from the Government side and I have not received a list of speakers from the Opposition. So, honourable Prime Minister then followed by the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor Biman Prasad and rounded off by Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Viliame Gavoka. Whilst we will begin, we will begin with the Government whilst we are waiting for your list, honourable Opposition Whip. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute and support the motion for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission moved by the honourable Sashi Kiran, the motion that is before Parliament at this time. Sir, the motion is probably going to be one of the most important in our parliamentary history. The debate that is now going to unfold will similarly make its mark in the</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 1801 annals of history of this Parliament and of this nation. The motion calls on us to lead Fiji into a national crusade of healing and reconciliation, to take our homeland, take our home into a new era of unity. Earlier on this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in Papua New Guinea. Also present was the Prime Minister of India, the honourable Narendra Modi and also representing His Excellency the President of the United States was Mr. Antony Blinken. In our discussion in which they were both very intently listening to what I was going to say, they were both looking at me and I knew, they knew who I was at that meeting, who I am, who I was some years ago. I proposed an idea for the Leaders of the Pacific that we should strive to make the Pacific a “zone of peace”. That call is still being talked about in leadership circles in the Pacific and it is gaining traction in other parts of the world. This motion as I said, leads Fiji into a national crusade of healing and reconciliation, to take our homeland into a new era of unity. In the last Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Leader of the Opposition, I had proposed to bring a motion, this same motion. It was opposed in the Business Committee and defeated. On 15 th March that year, I had a dream and in my contribution to the Business Committee, I quoted the soothsayer in Julius Caesar because of the date. Earlier on, the soothsayer had warned Julius Caesar, “Caesar, beware the Ides of March” and they were passing through the city on the Ides of March; 15 th March. When Julius Caesar saw the soothsayer on the side of the road, he called out to him, “Behold the Ides of March are come”. The soothsayer spoke to Julius Caesar and said “Aye, Caesar, but not gone” and on that day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world heard of the massacre in Sri Lanka. I thought that to me, it was a call; a call not only to try and find out what happened before 1987, what happened before 2000, what happened before 2006? But why did it happen? Why did those three events happen and appear in the calendar of unfortunate events in our country? When we were talking about the motion, I thought, I should not move it because in this Parliament, I am the only one guilty of any activity that we would like to find out the background of. You should all support it because you want to know what happened, why we should not have it, why we should move away from those emotions and from those feelings. I believe I was given this opportunity to be able to be part of the discussion of this motion, hopefully we will agree and contribute to the deliberations of the Commission. We must face the realities that we have. Someone had even said that Fiji is now going through the most turbulent chapter in our independent history as mentioned by the honourable mover. What do we do about it? Do we just move away from it, and hope will heal the wounds or heal the sources of those ill-will that give rise to hostile activities and malicious thoughts that created those situations, Mr. Speaker, Sir? When South Africa went through their Truth and Reconciliation conferences and meetings, the Great Desmond Tutu said, “At times such as this, it is not enough to look for compromise. It calls on all of us to make sacrifice.” Through this motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and driven by our combined resolve, we should aim to remove the division between our two main communities that have co- existed since well before Independence. In fact, I was reminded recently that a commentator once described Fiji as probably one of the most divided countries in the world, as I mentioned and as mentioned also by the honourable mover. But also, we are reminded of what His Holiness Pope John Paul II mentioned when he came to visit Fiji only a few years before 1987. He said, “Fiji the way the world should be”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable mover mentioned the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that was held in the Solomon Islands to try and resolve their inter-ethnic violence. I was called by His Excellency the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth to try and broker peace among the</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>1802 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 warring factions of the Solomon Islands. At the end, I made a recommendation, recommending a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I do not know why His Excellency Mr. Jitoko (now Justice Titoko) had recommended me to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth knowing of my own history in Fiji. But during that time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I asked to go to the heart of the rebel camp. The people of Guadalcanal were the ones who were trying to drive the Malaitans off Guadalcanal. I asked the Commissioner of Police, he said, “No it is unsafe, I cannot provide you any escort.” So, I asked the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church. He also told me that we could only go as far as the Balisuna Bridge and beyond that was not safe. I went and I walked with my Deputy, Professor Adebowale Adefuye of Nigeria, who was sent by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku. We were walking through the palm plantation, and I could see that the grass on both sides of the track had been disturbed. I knew there were people probably hiding in the grass, under the grass or behind the grass. All of a sudden, there was a whistle, and everyone stood up with their old World War II weapons and machete, and bows and arrows. Up to that time, Adefuye was asking me, “What is that in your hands?” I said, “Do not worry, you will find it useful.” When they all got up, I sat down in the middle of the road and brought out a bundle of waka. I clapped my hands (cobo) and presented the yaqona to the rebels and their commanders in Fijian. Everything in Fijian up to “ Soso ratu! ” and out of the group someone called out “E!”. He moved forward, took up the waka from my hands, gave it to the Commander who gave it back to him and he received it in the language of Sawakasa, people of Tailevu or the dialect which he had picked up during his time at Fulton. But that simple presentation, he went on and explained everything to his commanders and to the fighters, who accepted that they should come into the next village hall to talk. I asked if I could bring the Commissioner of Police, and they said no, not yet. “Can I bring the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church.” They said yes. So we continued the discussion until they agreed to speak to some politicians. They also asked for someone who was to represent them. That was the beginning of the talks that gave rise to my report which was the foundation of the establishment of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Some of you may have participated when you were in the Forces at the time. We again took a chartered flight later on when things did not get off the ground. A group of friends from Congress and the Senate in the United States flew down to Australia, and called me to join them in Brisbane, where they had hired an aircraft which flew us to Port Moresby. I was allowed to see the Governor General and the Prime Minister. As we walked into the Prime Minister’s office, I saw our own Minister for Foreign Affairs sitting there waiting for an appointment, or an opening to go and see the Prime Minister. I said to him, “ Tu Inoke, e vakacava? Au wara’a ji’o me dua noqu appointment. Oi, o kemudou? Sega neitou appointment, ‘eitou sa la’o madaga yani iloma ”. So we went to see the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea without an appointment, spoke to him and what we said was “maintain harmonious co-existence among the people of Papua New Guinea”. We came to the Solomon Islands, everyone was in their bunkers. The Governor-General was the only one that could see us, Sir Peter Kenilorea. No-one was serving him, only the ADC. We spoke to him, we asked for his cooperation. We looked for cigar that night Mr. Speaker, Sir, because one of our friends could not sleep without smoking cigar so I said, who knows Honiara? He said I know. At this time the only place open would probably be a Mess but they do not have a Mess or the Yacht Club, they have a Yacht Club. They managed to open the Yacht Club and brought a cigar out for my friend.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>1803 We went to Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa all without an appointment but we were received. I think something had preceded us. I think it was the spirit for peace or the strive for reconciliation among the people. We managed to get everyone to come and talk even when we did not have an appointment and when they asked me at the end, what do you think of the Solomons? Solomons is like driving along and you see someone that has been hit by a hit and run driver and you pick him up and take him to the hospital. The doctor looks at him and they say we have to administer blood transfusion. They save the life and when the comes to, he is strong and he sees blood flowing to his veins, “I cannot have this, I am not allowed to have this” why not? In my belief I am not allowed to receive anyone else’s blood. The doctors had to do what they had to do, but he had to sign and then he signs but he was alright. He had already received how many pints of blood but he was alright. That was the story I checked - Solomon needed that. Solomon needed that injection of people to work for Solomon Island’s peace. In this case we are fortunate, we are moving our own motion. We are going to be debating this motion for our own peace, for our own harmonious co-existence with one another and I challenge you all. You do not have any reason to oppose this, I have but I am opening it up. I would probably want to hide a lot of things I know, none of you has anything to hide so we should cooperate and work for this because I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to develop the idea of the Pacific being a zone of peace and also the Commonwealth of the Pacific, to be one that can be enjoyed by everyone in the Pacific and the world. We have so much to offer the world but how can we go and offer something that we do not have? If we can do that here, I am encouraged by the language in Parliament; by the way we are interacting with one another and I hope that we can take that out of Parliament and spread it amongst the people and also find out for ourselves what we can do better for the future generations. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Prime Minister for leading the batting and honourable Members for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders and with respect to the sitting times.</p></body>
