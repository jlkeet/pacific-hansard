BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, as all</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 1795 honourable Members would know that Parliament had already passed the Sitting Calendar for 2023 during the Sitting of Parliament earlier in the year, as well as an amendment during the July Sitting of Parliament after deliberations at the Business Committee. As has been the practice that the Business Committee had agreed that should there be a dire need to re-adjust some of the sittings that this would be subsequently tabled in Parliament for endorsement. So, in essence, Mr. Speaker, this motion is seeking Parliament’s approval to allow flexibilities for two requests: 1. 2. The first is for a deferment of the second week of Sitting for this September Sitting to another time to be decided later. The request needs the endorsement of the House to enable the Honourable Prime Minister to attend and participate at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The second amendment to the Sitting Calendar, Mr. Speaker is in the November Sitting and that is to bring the second week of sitting of Parliament that was earlier scheduled for the week of 27 th November to the 1 st December to be brought forward to the week of the 14 th November to 17 th November. The reason for that, Mr. Speaker, is to allow the honourable Prime Minister and the Fiji Government delegation upon the invite of the honourable Prime Minister to attend the invitation of the COP Meeting in Dubai. This is an important meeting, Mr. Speaker as you would know, Climate Change affects the Pacific Island States, especially our vulnerability as small Island States to the devastating power of natural disasters, tropical cyclones, floods, etc and we are amongst the most susceptible and expose to Climate Change impacts. In this regard, Mr Speaker Sir, given the salient points that I have put to the floor of this House, I do seek the indulgence of the Members to support this motion and I commend this motion before Parliament to prove the proposed amendments to the sitting week as per the new calendar that is in front of all Members today. I thank you for the support of the Members of the Business Committee that have agreed to it so we hope that Parliament will do the same. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor I have a list of speakers that have been identified by the honourable Whips and for the Government, it is the honourable Prime Minister that would like to take the floor. For the Opposition, it is the honourable Hem Chand, honourable Ketan Lal and to be rounded off by honourable Koya so I will now offer the floor to the honourable Prime Minister. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to support this motion to amend the Sitting Calendar that have been circulated to us because of some obligations that particularly in my case, I did not plan on the United Nations General Assembly that had come up later in our term and after the original sitting plan had been formulated. Secondly, in a later sitting where both I and the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be away for the COP Conference and we have also had to ask for those changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament for responding to some of these urgent calls from the Cabinet, particularly, from me as the Prime Minister. I also thank Parliament, honourable Members and you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for favourably considering these late requests. With those, I support the motion before Parliament.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>1796 2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 13 th Sept., 2023 HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to share my views on the motion before Parliament. It is imperative to highlight the potential consequences of reducing the number of sitting weeks in a parliamentary calendar. While certain benefits may be sought through this approach, it is crucial to carefully assess the negative impacts that such measures may have on democratic processes, representation and effective governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the beginning of each year, before the commencement of the new Parliament session, the Government releases the sitting calendar, which is done after careful planning. The Parliament Sitting Calendar guides the honourable Members of Parliament to develop their own personal calendar so that Members of Parliament can also attend to their delegated duties. The parliamentary sitting calendar is a great tool, not just for Members of Parliament, but also for anyone who interacts with the honourable Members of Parliament and those who take interest in politics. People look forward to Parliament Sitting. A reduced number of sitting weeks in the parliamentary calendar can impede the vital democratic principle of accountability. We were supposed to have two weeks of Parliament sitting in July and September, but it had been reduced to one week. The total sitting days, which was planned at the beginning of the year, was 49 days and now it has been reduced to 33 days. That means, the sitting days have been reduced by 6 days, which is equivalent to more than three weeks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the motives behind the reduction in the sitting days. I suggest that honourable Ministers give priority to Parliament sitting, and where possible, delegate technical staff from the Ministry to attend overseas meetings and engagements. Parliament siting days should not be compromised because Parliament has very important roles where important issues are debated, Government spending is discussed, laws are made and amended and Opposition examines and challenges the work of the Government through questioning and debating. With these words, I do not support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Hem Chand?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, my apologies, I support the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> After having heard you in your first comment, I wanted to state clearly in this august Parliament that it took a lot of us in the Business Committee to agree to the very issues that you have raised here. It is lucky that we have the honourable Leader of the Opposition, together with honourable Koya and honourable Usamate, who had been in the Cabinet Office for a very long time. They gave their superb advice that the month of September is a definite for the UN. If we take this to the members of our staff, we will just be passing the buck here. It stops with us here and when a request comes from the honourable Prime Minister, we have to accommodate that. In so doing, we reluctantly agreed to this change of the timetable because we are also used to something that we have agreed that sticks but, again, nothing is set in stone here. It is not a blueprint calendar because it is subject to change. When issue arises to make changes, we will just have to address it head-on and what I would like to share with you, honourable Members, was the very thing that we discussed in the Business Committee. It took a while to get an agreement, especially with your Whip. Honourable Maharaj is always sounding out the very thing that you said honourable Chand - 2 weeks, the number of sittings in a year - is all part of the plan from January when this comes out, but we have changed this. This has been changing and we bear your indulgence in that, but we have been guided by the Leader of the Opposition just to ensure, through his advice, that we have taken on board the Leader of the Government in Parliament to advise the honourable Prime Minister that September is a “no</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 2023 Parliament Sitting Calendar – Amendment of 1797 go” area for us because that is when the United Nations sits. Now, we have heard from the honourable Prime Minister that he will be going to Dubai again, that has just been finalised too and apart from that, the other meetings together with the honourable Leader of the Opposition. Please, bear with us on that, honourable Member. HON. K. K. LAL.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wish to withdraw my opportunity to speak as you have already explained the reasons behind these things. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir, a very short contribution. Honourable Prime Minister, we do understand very well with respect the commitments that you have and also with respect to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). What the Parliament must also know is that the UNGA meeting is actually set for a particular time always is the last week in September. I urge the honourable Members of the other side of Parliament to ask their staff to pull up their socks because I think the honourable Leader of the Opposition had actually warned everyone earlier that that week is dedicated for UNGA and nothing was done about it. It came at a later stage, we understand that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why we are agreeing to it. But I think sometimes we do not (speaking for both sides) listen and at times when you are offered good advice from us, please, listen because that is important. It is about Fiji at the UNGA, it is about Fiji at the Climate Conference and I think that is very, very important. I think someone dropped their lunchbox, obviously, at the Ministry and that is not anything bad with respect to the honourable Prime Minister, it is someone at the office that did not actually do their job properly. Having said that, Sir, I think enough has been said with respect to the number of days but just the last point, Sir, next time, I think the request was made from the government with respect to having two weeks, et cetera, we have canvased all of that at the Business Committee. It is a good idea that we have the two weeks, maybe for the next year’s Calendar which might come up sooner rather than later. At end of the day, we need to ensure that we get our calendar right because travelling is important. We have lost quite a number of days in Parliament. I know Mr. Speaker, Sir has said, look, utilise it well, the Committee has considered et cetera, all of that is there. Please, Sir, ask the staff to ensure that the honourable Prime Minister’s calendar is correct right at the start of the year. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Members for your contribution and I especially thank our Members from the Opposition for supporting this motion and also for withdrawing contributions upon what you have shared, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Thank you for that. We take note of the improvements that need to be made in terms of setting the next Parliamentary Calendar. I will look forward to the Business Committee of having certainly a more robust and mutual exchanges for the next Sitting Calendar whether two weeks is suited or whether one week and more frequently that is something we are certainly always open to and we look forward to that in the setting of the next Calendar. I want to thank honourable Members for supporting the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, in addition to what has been said, I forgot to mention what was raised by the honourable Leader of Opposition in the Business Committee and that is for us to do a late booking in that month at the United Nations in New York. The hotel rates are really sky high. I think the previous Government paid a price for that when they summoned him to attend</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>1798 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 and the rate that they paid was about $14,000 or something just for those few days of meeting at the United Nations, so it is a very costly and expensive thing. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
