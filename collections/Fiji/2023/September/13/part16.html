SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for tea but before doing so, I seek your indulgence. I have two more speakers from the Government side and I have seven from the Opposition side that have been listed. So, I will perhaps ask that since the honourable Prime Minister has taken the lead in the batting order, I would like to strongly suggest that I will be naming the five or six honourable Opposition Members to bat as well without any alternate Member from the Government accept after the fifth and that is where I will call the name of the Deputy Prime Minister honourable Biman Prasad, honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Koya I will then ask Deputy Prime Minister honourable Gavoka to be last speaker on the motion. I hope that speaks well with each and every one of you, honourable Members. I now adjourn Parliament for tea. The Parliament adjourned at 4.03 p.m.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1805 The Parliament resumed at 4.42 p.m.</p></body>
