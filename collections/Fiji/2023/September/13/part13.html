<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Sugar Cane Growers Election (Question No. 115/2023) HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament as to when the Sugar Cane Growers election will be conducted as promised to our</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1775 cane sector by the Government? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, I must congratulate the honourable Prime Minister on his birthday and I wish him well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had prepared a six-page answer and since honourable Bala is not here, I will be very short and sweet. Yes, the election is going to take place as Cabinet has endorsed that Sugar Cane Growers Election and we are now proceeding to hold the Election. Our target is to hold the Election probably on the first quarter of next year. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Sugar and the very Minister who said that the Fijian farmers are lazy... HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Question! HON. R. R. SHARMA.- …who made that statement and he is here, after the election of the District Directors and will be members of the Sugar Cane Growers Council, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament who is going to fund the operation of the Council?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a new question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- It is part of the Council:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I have answered the question which was specific on whether the election will take place, and that it is. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister for Sugar; what measures does the Government have in place to address the concerns and grievances of cane sector stakeholders, if the promised Sugarcane Growers Council Election faces further delay or complications?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, again, it is a new question, but there will be no delay.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, my question is, how is this Election going to take place? We know it is going to be sector-wise and we know that the number of farmers in each sector has reduced, so are we going to merge the sectors or how are we going to have this Election? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we are currently looking at the entire formula on all the sectors. Once we determine how many farmers are left, then we will put up the roll. So, let us wait for the Elections Office to help us out. EFL Grid Extension Work Programme (Question No. 116/2023) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on the EFL Grid Extension work programme for the current financial year? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question and I thank the honourable Member.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1776</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, the Ministry has allocated $4.1 million. This will include grid extension and house wiring, in addition to the $12.4 million that has been paid in 2022- 2023 financial year. This will cater for 111 projects with a total of 1,545 households to benefit from these projects. It is a reduction from the $12.4 million to $4.1 million but this will enable the Department of Energy and Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) to catch up on the backlog from 2018. This will be in addition to the 29 projects that are currently under construction by EFL, which benefits about 1,966 households with a value of $16.38 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for grid extension, normally communities apply to EFL, EFL does a survey and determines a budget, the Department of Energy proposes this budget which is then paid to EFL to progress the work. As I have mentioned, there is a backlog and this includes ongoing projects for grid extension with a total of 140 projects from 2018 to 2019 which is worth about $12.1 million; from 2021-2022 which is worth $2.05 million; and from 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 which is worth $15.9 million. For the information of Parliament, some of the constraints or causes of delays include projects crossing leased areas, for example, Fiji Pine lands with the Navatusila Grid, the limitations in terms of the number of contractors and also their capacities; there have also been issues regarding material shortages - transformers, poles, et cetera; of course, high staff turnover, not only in EFL but also in the Department of Energy; we faced the issue of COVID-19; there have been issues with the revised tenders and costs; global supply chain issues in terms of such technical equipment; inclement weather; and finally also the challenges of our rural roads in terms of access. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the information that has been provided on the continuation of grid extensions. It is good to see that the work is continuing. Now, we can see that the grid has been extended right up to the upper reaches of Naitasiri, across to Tavua and up Namosi. We are glad to see that that work is continuing, and that money has been set aside. The honourable Minister mentioned that there was also backlog of projects, initially way back to 2017 but now it is from 2018 to 2022. So, the funds for this year will be from 2023 to 2024. I would like to request if the honourable Minister might just give us an update on those backlog where money has already been paid to EFL, I believe now it is only back from 2018 up to 2022, and when is it likely that these projects will be completed?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, yes, those backlogs are nearing completion.</p><p>Below are the details: 1. Nukulau Village, Yawe, Vuniyasi, Korolevu, Keiyasi, Sigatoka Stage 3 worth $1.7 million - this has been paid. 2. Navatusila District, Navosa, Sigatoka Stage 1 including Nabutautau Village, Drokadroka, Natoka worth $5.05 million - this has also been paid. 3. Nalawa District, Nasau, Rakiraki Stage 2 worth $2.3 million - this has been paid to EFL. 4. Naikelikoso, Wainikoro, Labasa worth $2.5 million - this has been paid. 5. Welagi, Naselesele, Taveuni Stages 1 and 2 worth $3.9 million - also conveyed to EFL. From the information I have been provided with, this will progress significantly this year and, definitely, we will be working towards their completion next year.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1777 HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to thank the honourable Minister for that feedback. I know the people of Uluisavudua, Sawani, will be celebrating after hearing this news from the honourable Minister. The question is, whether the backlogs cover those who already have the grid, but the power is yet to be released - from the Nacavanadi Junction to Navakaka and those from Nacavanadi Junction to Kasavu, who have been waiting for quite some time now for that. The line is there or grid, but there is no power. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I note that, but as mentioned, what is in the programme is what I have mentioned. But we have also received requests and also there are some in the pipeline which will be factored into the annual budget as we move forward into 2024 to 2025 and onwards. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mission of EFL is to transition into clean energy in the future. Instead of transitioning to net zero emission, clean energy and zero carbon footprints, how do you justify that these operations are running mostly on diesel operation and causing a lot of air pollution? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a new question. A major percentage of our energy in the country is renewable energy, through hydro. Even in Taveuni, that is hybrid both hydro and also diesel, so that is the target we are working towards. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question to the honourable Minister would be as he has mentioned that there has been a decrease in the budget from $12.5 million to $4.5 million and he has actually mentioned some of the projects that will be undertaken in this financial year. There were two projects earmarked for this financial year, one was for 21 families in Tabia, Labasa and I would like to declare my interest for the second one which is for 15 to 18 families in Bulileka, Labasa. Can the honourable Minister confirm if these projects are still on the lists or have they been removed because of the decrease in the budget? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you honourable Member, I do not have that information with me but I can convey it to you later. You can send me an email on that. Thank you. Support Systems for Single Mothers (Question No. 117/2023) HON. F. S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection explain what specific provisions or support systems the Government intends to implement to assist single mothers who might be financially impacted by the recent tax adjustments, especially given their increased responsibility as sole breadwinners? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Yes, the increase in VAT has been acknowledged and is seen in the increase in prices. Certainly, in anticipation of this, honourable Member, you have seen an increase accordingly in terms of our Social Protection Allowance which increased by 25 percent in this year’s Budget. The Government, through the Ministry, especially for single mothers who are sole breadwinners, we have seen an increase in their allowances in terms of the Family Assistance Scheme which used to be called the Poverty Benefit Scheme, as well as Child Protection Allowance, so any children they have they can claim also the Child Protection Allowance which has seen an increase from $177 to $196. There is also, of course, the Food Voucher which was only limited to Max Value Supermarket now has been turned to cash so that they have the liberty and the freedom to shop</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1778</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 wherever they want - a cheaper supermarket or to buy fresh produce outside of the supermarket. Before they were limited only to the prices that Max Value is imposing. Further to our Social Protection Assistance, we have been working with our development partners and our line Ministries to create opportunities for our single mothers as well as our young people who we can train and put to work. One such initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is our partnership with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and APTC and they are piloting this programme which actually began yesterday - 12 th September, 2023, so we have 10 participants who have been given full scholarships to undertake an entry level Engineering Certificate Level II. So, no experience required, and it runs for 10 weeks until 1 st December, 2023 where there will be employment-ready and placed in employment. From the 10 participants who were identified from the HART community and other organisations like Homes of Hope, two are single mothers and there are two from the Nasinu Women’s Rugby Club - their names were put up, one participant is from the Veilomani Boys Home in Ba and I wish to thank the Australian Government and APTC for that initiative. While it is a small number, we hope to increase this engagement through APTC and other colleges where we are seeking the support of the Australian Government and other development partners to provide these scholarships for our people. Mr. Speaker, another initiative is by TVET Pasifika. The advertisement has gone out at the Fiji National University which just started with free courses for our street dwellers, street kids and our people, including single mothers in informal and squatter settlements. This training programme is in domestic electrical installation, basic screen printing, basic cookery, small engine repairs, household and sanitary plumbing. I wish to thank the honourable Minister for Education and FNU for partnering with our Ministry to provide the scholarships, to deal with our unemployed men, women and youth living in settlements and streets, to have a pathway, to move our people from poverty to productivity. Mr. Speaker, while our Labour Mobility Programmes are taking a majority of our men, we have a huge opportunity to put our women to work, including our single mums, so we are working with our development partners - Australia and New Zealand, to help us mitigate the loss of labour we are experiencing. I think we, as a Government, and we in this Parliament should demand more from our development partners to come to the table to train our people and incentivise them to stay and not to move overseas. Mr. Speaker, I am also in negotiation with the honourable Minister for Housing in terms of our single mothers and single parents living in the Public Rental Board flats. I have approached the Ministry and hopefully they are reviewing to see what they can do for our single parents and single mums especially for the huge debts that had been incurred during COVID in terms of rentals because they had lost jobs during that time. This is something I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Housing for considering this proposal in terms of looking at a way to either reduce or forgive that debt of what was owed from COVID period because of the loss of jobs. I am talking about single parents because there are quite a number of fathers living in Public Rental Board with a number of children who are on Social Welfare that struggling to pay that debt from during the COVID period, but the rentals kept accumulating at PRB so, we hope that we can finalise that soon enough. Like I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, in mitigating the loss of labour that we are experiencing, we do want to put our women to work. We want to encourage our employers to have childcare in their</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1779 places of employment to support our women, because one of the main reasons of absenteeism and other issues that our women face, especially our single mums, is a need for childcare and they are struggling to have this kind of care in their own homes or support from the communities. We are very grateful for the HART community coming forward in terms the APTC Course because they have agreed to look after the children of the single mums and single parents from the HART community, while these single mums and parents attend to the course for the next 10 weeks. The HART community now providing the childcare to look after their children, so I want to acknowledge the HART community for coming forward. Companies like Mark One Apparel already has a Child Care facility in their place of employment. Vinod Patel has come forward. Fiji Airways is exploring it. I know I have been speaking with honourable Kamikamica in terms of these BPOs coming into the country that will employ thousands of people, to see to it that there are childcare facilities for our mums or parents to be able to place their children in there. I know there is a question coming later about Early Childhood Care Centres but working in conjunction with our Ministries also includes our Ministry for Agriculture, Ministry for Fisheries so that we can see to our rural women to have some form of employment. It is on us to come up with project proposals to put our women to work and they do want to work. So, while the Government is assisting to provide welfare payments, it is a vision and mission of the Coalition Government that we need to move our able-bodied men and women. We are about to complete our database in terms of our able-bodied men and women who are on family assistance Scheme, including our single mums to put them to work. I wish to just quickly address this issue about the EBayShop. Many are defending it, many are opposing it, but it is time for our people to stop falling for these schemes where they can make a quick buck, make money without having to work for it. We, as Members of Parliament, need to condemn these schemes and we need to encourage our people to apply for jobs. There are so many vacancies, if we are giving money to our young people simply to make them go away or simply to make a quick buck. Let us get our young people, our mums and dads and also young families to apply for employment and to go for training. Now, being available for free and on scholarships, it is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we move our people from poverty to productivity and from a life of welfare to well-being. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the answer which is quite comprehensive. Sir, if I may just have a little extra minute just to add something to it. There is a phenomenal opportunity, and my question is coming with respect to not just single mums. You said that DFAT and FNU offer training, but there is a phenomenal opportunity for a training exercise and it could be jointly done between the Minister for Trade and yourself because they have a lot of training facilities; financial literacy et cetera to get these people to them. Have you been able to maybe form a committee to do that? I also concur with the honourable Minister’s comments with respect to the EBayShop issue. We should condemn it outright now. Unfortunately, Sir, we, as Fijians, are quite gullible when these things happen and I know for a fact that civil servants, the Police Force, military people and educated people have actually been stunned with this and the number is quite large. Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I still think that it needs to be a whole lot more education on it, but the question is, will you or have you already put something in place with respect to getting the</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1780</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 financial literacy and training that is needed for these people to get out in the workforce? I know the Ministry of Trade has a lot of avenues with respect to that. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member. As the former Minister for Trade, I know you would have had collaborations with the Ministry. We are continuing with that good work. I am grateful to the Trade Officers at the Ministry of Trade who come to all our activities that they work with our Department of Women on exactly that. But having said that, honourable Member, this is something that we, as Ministers or as Government or as Members, need to perhaps increase our capacity in terms of project proposals, engaging the private sector, working together through the Ministry for Trade and getting their skills (I know they have met with Investment Fiji and trade officers where they can increase the capacity of our people; women especially to be able to put together project proposals, so that we as the Ministry can then take it to our development partners. That is a skill in itself and I am hopeful that we will continue that work and I am very grateful for the Ministry for Trade for working with us. HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for her reply to that question. Just a suggestion before I ask my supplementary question in terms of doing your scoping for various trainings and courses that are available for single mums, in terms of focusing on HART and various homes and various women organisation, can I suggest that you just increase your scoping to the various communities and settlements that are available because there are more that live within these communities and settlements within the urban areas and the rural areas as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are focusing on women and I thank the honourable Minister for focusing on single mums. Just to ask whether there are avenues as well out there for single dads in terms of social protection? MR. SPEAKER.- That was a lengthy one, honourable Bia. First of all, you began with that suggestion, then you went to the women, and now you end up with single men. The question is directed towards the Ministry of Women. Your question is on single men.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. BIA.:</span> Single dads, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the suggestion about working with the communities widely. As I have said, this is a pilot project, Why the HART community was approached, even though we consulted widely, was because of their ability to provide child care for the mums so that they can attend the course. That was the very big part of our scoping. I would then hope to appeal to settlements where the mums or the community will come together and be able to provide that help so that they can attend courses. But I thank you and I note your suggestion. In terms of the single men, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Single dads:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> Single dads, yes, same thing? MR. SPEAKER.- That goes to another Ministry. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Social protection:</span></p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1781 HON. L. D. TABUYA.- So, single dads, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact the suggestion to approach it was an appeal from a single dad at the PRB flat in Nabua, that triggered discussions with the PRB and the honourable Minister for Housing. He has five children, he was on his own and he had to leave his work to look after his children during COVID. It wrapped up in a thousand of dollars in terms of PRB rental arrears. But this is something we look at all of them, they are entitled of course to apply for the Family Assistance Scheme, just as single mothers do. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Social Welfare increment of 25 percent that the honourable Minister is talking about is not fully reflected in the payments. Those who are supposed to receive $125 some of them are receiving only $115. I have received some complaints from the senior citizens, we have registered the complaint with the Nasinu Welfare Office. I understand because the Budget was implemented on 1 st August, 2023 but then again this month, Sir, some of them who were supposed to receive $125 have just received $115. While I am speaking on that, Sir, just to let the honourable Minister know that those who are getting $115 are only able to withdraw $110 and those are receiving $125 are only able to receive $120 due to this ATM provisions where they cannot receive the $5. My question, Sir, when is this going to be rectified? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I will ask the honourable Member to, please, write in formally so that we can act on it. Thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There are cases:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not think that is correct:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Women for the answer she has given. I would like to ask something with regards to the nutrition bit of babies if we are talking about single mothers and working mothers, though we are actually promote from Ministry of Health that breastfeeding is best for the babies but most of the time we are not able to do so, especially with working mothers and even single mothers who are working. If you look at the price even though on the price control, a tin of SMA is around S22, S26 is ranging from $38 to $45 which is quite massive. Is the Ministry actually looking at subsiding these formula somehow or the other, or are there any talks in place to give some tax incentive to one of the companies in Fiji who can actually manufacture so that this cost can go down because nutrition for babies at a very tender age is very important? MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply honourable Minister, you look at the rest of the questions has changed, a single mother to single dad and now we are talking about breast feeding. This is all... HON. F. S. KOYA.- All connected!! MR. SPEAKER.- All connected?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a new question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I think we need to address the issues that were raised earlier on, which is the thrust of the question, it is do with single mothers. Let us keep it at that.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1782</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister provided a comprehensive answer, which is why a lot of questions developed around it. My question will be very brief. Will the Government consider the review of national minimum wage? It is good that you are encouraging single mums and women to be educated and come back to the employment sector. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an advocate for the national minimum wage, I think there is always room for improvement and certainly we will consider that. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, my plea is, please confine the question to the thrust of the first question and let us keep it at that, otherwise we are going around in circles here. We are even going to men breastfeeding the children or something. Update – 4 th Review of Fiji’s Trade Policy (Question No. 118/2023) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Trade, Co- operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications provide an update on the 4 th Review of Fiji’s Trade Policy at the World Trade Organization that took place from 19th July to 21st July, 2023 in Geneva? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps just very briefly before I begin my answer, I hope the other side of Parliament starts getting what we have been talking on this side of Parliament, which is, that there is new democracy in this country now. In the old Parliament, they would never have the opportunity and you had been so tolerant, and I think they owe you … (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- … some gratitude. On behalf of this side of Parliament and for the people of Fiji, the other side of Parliament will agree with us that there is new democracy in this country, real democracy in this country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to answer the question. I rise to provide an update on the Fiji’s recent engagement in the fourth review of our trade policy at the World Trade Organization (WTO). I wish to extend my gratitude to the former Minister, who was part of the process from the beginning, and it shows what we were able to achieve in Geneva this year. From 19 th July to 21 st July, 2023, Fiji actively participated in the fourth review of our Trade Policy at the WTO. The review process played a pivotal role in enabling us to thoroughly assess the impact of our trade policies, engage in constructive dialogue with our trading partners and deliberate on the necessary adjustments to enhance our trade strategy further. The trade reviews are mandated as an exercise stemming from the Marrakesh Agreement that established the WTO. This review serves to enhance transparency and understanding of countries’ trade policies and practices and enable multilateral assessments of how the WTO member policies affect the world trading system. It is crucial to clarify that this is not an illegal scrutiny, but rather, a constructive stocktake aimed at fostering a better understanding and providing recommendations for improvement.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1783 The frequency of this review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, varies according to country size and for Fiji our trade policies undergo review every six years at the WTO. Trade Policy Reviews process involves two essential documents - our policy statement by the Government under review and a detailed independent report authored by the WTO Secretariat. The journey towards Fiji’s 4 th Trade Policy Review began in July 2022. To prepare the WTO Secretariat Report, we work diligently to provide timely information to the Secretariat, with assistance of our stakeholders. Additionally, a scoping mission to Fiji was conducted by the Secretariat in March 2023 to finalise the report. The Ministry also coordinated consultations with relevant agencies and stakeholders to prepare Fiji’s policy statement. Once these reports were compiled, they were circulated to all WTO members for submission or written questions. Fiji then had to respond to the questions in advance of the Trade Policy Review at the WTO headquarters in July. Fiji received over 169 written advance questions from various WTO members demonstrating the global communities’ keen interest in our trade policies. We are pleased to have provided comprehensive and well considered answers to these questions both in writing and during the Trade Policy Review session. I have to say Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we did answer all the questions and I would just like to thank the Ministry officials who worked very hard to ensure that we projected a very good image of our country at the WTO. During the Trade Review Policy session Fiji received overwhelming support and recommendations from numerous WTO countries such as Barbados, Vanuatu, Ecuador, Timor-Leste, Samoa, Indonesia, Kenya, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Mauritius, Japan, Canada, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, United States, Singapore, European Union, China, Costa Rica, Brazil and South Korea. These wide-ranging support underscores Fiji’s small but robust presence on the global trade stage. Fiji’s significant contributions to the WTO did not go unnoticed Mr. Speaker, Sir. The contributions on the Fisheries Agreement were particularly highlighted and acknowledged by all members underscoring our commitment to the Blue Pacific Ocean, blue oceans, the conservation of oceans and sustainable fisheries management. In this regard the ratification of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies yesterday will actually do a lot to confirm our stature as a leader in this area. In the realm of environmental sustainability Fiji’s role as co-chair of the plastics dialogue received high praise as we facilitated discussions on plastic pollution and promoted environmentally sustainable plastic trading. Furthermore, Fiji’s decision to lower tariffs on meat imports was warmly welcomed by WTO members demonstrating our commitments to open and accessible trade environments. Given Fiji’s active role in the WTO Fiji was also invited to join a number of plurilateral negotiations taking place in the margins of the WTO. These include services, domestic regulations and e-commerce. Australia has also invited Fiji to join the Care and Needs Scale (CANS) group which lobbies against agricultural subsidy. Trade has long been the lifeblood of Fiji’s development Mr. Speaker, Sir, deeply engrained in the very fabric of our society. It is through trade that we have expanded our horizon, open new opportunities and fostered innovation. Our journey towards economic progress has been fundamentally linked to our ability to connect with the world and showcase the richness of our culture and its produce or products. The WTO plays a critical role in this endeavour providing a platform for a rules based, transparent and equitable global trading system. As a small island nation, Fiji acknowledges the</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1784</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 importance of the WTO in ensuring that all nations regardless of their size, but can participate in international trade on fair and just terms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the WTO Secretariat for their tireless efforts in producing the comprehensive report that served as a cornerstone of our trade policy review in Geneva. I would also like to thank His Excellency, Mr. George Mina of Australia who is the WTO Ambassador for Australia who served in his role as the Discussant for Fiji’s Trade Policy Review. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji remains committed to the principles of fair and open trade and we will continue to work closely with our global partners through the WTO to strengthen our trade policies for the benefit of Fiji and its people. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the honourable Deputy Prime Minister that we are also seeing contradicting scenarios of the so-called new democracy. In his answer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the question he stated about Conservation of Oceans something that is in the heart of the Marrakesh Agreement, Conservation of Oceans. On 5 th April, he moved the motion in here about the protection of our oceans. So, if the honourable Deputy Prime Minister can tell us and tell the House where is Fiji’s official position on the Conservation of Oceans?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N.

SPEAKER.- No running commentary. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I commend the honourable Minister because I know that the review was some 111 odd pages of report. So, trying to condense it into a 10 minute answer was actually quite difficult. I have like a 111 questions to ask but something that I can speak to him about. Just one question, honourable Minister, in light of the review that has taken place this is obviously guided by the fact that Marrakesh Agreement has asked that periodically your trade policy be reviewed. The Initial Fijian Trade Policy Framework was set up in 2015 sort of had a 10 year lifespan. We are about almost less than 24 months may be away from that expiry. Will you be going through another exercise to come up with the new Trade Policy Framework bearing in mind the recommendations that have come out of the actual Trade Policy Review by the WTO? There are quite a few things that we need to do in terms of intellectual property rights and we are talking about trips and trips waiver, et cetera and all of those things. There are many new things that have been made available to Fijians and are now part of our landscape. So, my question really is that to incorporate all of that will we be doing another exercise in terms of getting a newer Trade Policy Framework sooner rather than later, Sir? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thank honourable Koya for that question. Yes, absolutely when I first came in, I saw the documents from the last Trade Framework and one of my first questions was, why can we not update it now when there are suggestions from the technocrats which is a wise one? Let us focus first on delivering on the TPR in Geneva and after all the comments are received, we can then progress on the framework reviewing and issuing a new document. That is in the pipeline, we will be starting work on that soon. Construction/Extension of Nayavu Health Centre (Question No. 119/2023) HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on the Ministry’s plans for the construction and extension of Nayavu Health Centre? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his Oral Question. Sir, the Nayavu Health Centre in Wainibuka is one few of the health facilities around the country that the Ministry is working on for infrastructural improvement. The current clinic has aged through the years and its ongoing renovations together with the current structures needed. Sir, in 2020, Government then, through the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) constructed a building beside the current health clinic at a cost of $576,580. The brand new building was intended to be staff quarters and has been occupied recently by clinical staff working at the health centre. However, upon reviewing the priorities for the health services at Nayavu, we were given that there are adequate housing still in place and the Ministry is planning to repurpose the new building to house some health services that are currently provided from the health clinic. Those health services will be:</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1786</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 • General Outpatients Department (GOPD); • Specialist Outpatients Department (SOPD); • Doctor’s Consultation Room; and • Holding beds for short term patient observation. Prior to this, we will re-house the staff living in the new building and the nearby staff quarters and we will duly inform the general public whilst we have finalised the new arrangements for the health services from the health centre. In addition to this, I would like to also acknowledge the continuous support from our development partners, both multi-lateral, unilateral in assisting the Ministry in terms of improving the infrastructure. One in particular that is assisting the Nayavu Health Centre facility is under KOICA funded SHAPE Projects (Strengthening Health Adaptation Project). Under the SHAPE Project, we have identified to do extension of the waiting area, polarisation of the facility and other improvements in the wash facilities as well. Those are earmarked for Nayavu Health Centre and not only that, the Ministry is also looking at other facilities. Just to add on to that, the KOICA is looking also into 19 other facilities, a total of 20 with Nayavu being one of them. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for Health for what he had mentioned of Nayavu Health Centre. I think the people from Wainibuka and parts of Ra will benefit from the new standard of health service in Nayavu in years to come. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with relation to the extension of the Nayavu Health Centre, will that also mean that the scope or the status of the health centre will be increased because I know in some of these health centres they always have a problem? Whenever there is a problem at Korovou, the staff get pulled out and they are put into Korovou. I am just wondering about the staffing structure, will that also be improved and also the level of service that will be provided there. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the extension is for the scope of the infrastructure, but the Health Centre level itself is standard to cater for that amount of population. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nayavu Health Centre looks after Rokovuaka on the border of Ra, Naveicovatu on the border of Wainibuka and Nakida in Naitasiri and also Soa. So the population has grown over the years and also with the infrastructure development in terms of road, electricity and connectivity. There is also a lot of accidents along that road. My question to the honourable Minister, will the Ministry consider the introduction of the new medical services like laboratory, dental, x-ray and mortuary at the Nayavu Health Centre due to the increase in population? Will the honourable Minister consider the introduction of new services together with the expansion of the infrastructure at Nayavu Health Centre? MR. SPEAKER.- That is an interesting request coming now. They asked for the scope, the extension, now they went four mortuaries. It is a great expectation. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Ravunawa for his supplementary question. As I had mentioned, one of the new buildings done in 2020 are repurposing it to cater for clinical services. For the new building if you have been there, the road goes straight in front of it and there is a small round about in front. We are trying to utilise that space for clinical services and as you mentioned, it is along the highway at a accident prone area, we can utilise that area for emergency as well. However, at the moment the standard is, as I had</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1787 mentioned before, if we are to increase that, then we have to involve other speciality in that area, then we have to improve and raise the standard of that health facility. In terms of the mortuary, as I was talking with honourable Rokomatu, it has been raised a couple of times from that area in Wainibuka. We have also identified the need that between Rakiraki and Korovou, there is nothing in between those areas. So, we will be taking that into consideration probably in the next financial year. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.33 p.m.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1788</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members just before we continue, I would like to show you the yellow and red cards, for some have been calling for the yellow card. It is good that the Secretariat has prepared this, and it is now ready. (Laughter) I hope I would not be like the referee that ref the game against our team, but I hope to be impartial. It is just get some sense of direction in how we conduct ourselves honourably in this House. This will be the intermediary between the Privileges Committee so at least you have some process in between as the yellow and if that continues then it becomes red and then the Privileges Committee can sit in and decide. I think it will make it easy for them because right now I have been getting a few letters of complaints and it is quite hard. And for that respect we had long meetings with the Secretariat and we even sought the views of the Solicitor-General to help us because everything has to be seen to be transparent and legally done as well. Progress of Land Development for Informal Settlements (Question No. 120/2023) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament on the status of land development works in progress to formalise informal settlements? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question placed before the august Parliament this afternoon. Before I provide my Parliamentary response this afternoon, please, allow me to express my wishes. First, I would like to join the former speakers as well as honourable Members who have expressed their best wishes to our humble Prime Minister on his special day today as well as the honourable Bulitavu on his birthday today. MR. SPEAKER.- Are they getting younger? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to congratulate and express my best wishes to the Fiji Water Flying Fijians Rugby Team. The Captain of the team is from the province of Serua so as a neighbouring province, I congratulate them for a job well done in their last game against Wales, even though they fell short. But I think they really warmed our hearts after that game and also wish them the best in their next game against Australia. I know they are going to beat Australia in their second game. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- I also thank the honourable Members who have also shown their support placing the Fiji Rugby Union pins as well as from the Municipal Councils throughout the country, they also showed their support by putting up the national flag just to support our national rugby team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formalisation of informal settlements is a crucial endeavour towards achieving sustainable outcomes. It involves improving the living conditions, infrastructure and services in these settlements to provide their residents with secure and dignified living conditions.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1789 Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the Ministry of Housing and Informal Settlement Upgrade Programme is an in situ capital programme focused on improving livelihoods for people living in informal settlements across our nation. It comes to the Ministry as a total of 48 development leases, out of which 44 are located on iTaukei land and four on State land. These development leases are spread throughout Fiji with 13 settlements located in the Central Division, 14 settlements in the Northern Division and 21 settlements in the Western Division. The acquisition of these development leases started from 2012 and I thank my predecessors for this great initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, three out of 48 informal settlements, they are Cuvu in Nadroga, Ledrusasa in Nadi and Waidamudamu in Nausori have had their upgrades completed in 2022. These settlements are now in the process for lot allocation. Additionally, four informal settlements are presently in construction phase and these are in Sakoca in Nasinu which comprise of 174 households, Tavela in Nadi with 68 households and recently Field 4 of Lautoka which is around 77 households as well as Tore in Lautoka too with 59 households. The total estimated cost of upgrade in these settlements is around $20.1 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, completion of preparatory work includes topographic surveys, preparation of scheme plans, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), geotech surveys and engineering plans are completed allowing the commencement of constructions works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, engineering plans for five informal settlements have recently been approved and these are Lovu Seaside, Nabare and Delaisaweni informal settlements in Lautoka, Valewaquyaya Settlement in Ba and Vunika in Labasa. Additionally, Caubati and Wakanisila Settlements in Nasinu, Sasawira Settlement in Nausori and Nadonumai in Lami are earmarked to complete their engineering plans by end of this financial year. The total estimated cost for the upgrade of these settlements is around $75 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, four settlements are currently in scheme plan phase which is planned to be also completed in this financial year. The first one is Tukutora in Lautoka, Vunivau A and Vunivau B in Labasa and Qauia in Lami. There are five settlements that will be commencing preparation phase with consultants recently awarded, these includes River Road in Nasinu, Veivauceva in Nasinu, Vatia settlement in Siberia, Delaimasimasi in Lautoka and Uluisila in Sigatoka. Hence, all these 25 Settlements are earmarked to be formalised for the next six years subject to budget allocation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the remaining 23 informal settlements out of the 48 are in preliminary phases to begin preparatory works by 2026. The preliminary phase includes preparation of bidding documents for the tender to select a Consultant to undertake the preparation work. Furthermore, the Ministry also pays the lease premiums and yearly rentals for the 44 development leases in iTaukei. A total of $4.1 million in premium have been paid in addition to $0.9 million in yearly rentals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also highlight that the Ministry of Housing is also working in exploring options to include the improvement of housing conditions such as ways in which existing homes can be renovated, construction of new housing units and providing financial support to residents who are not eligible for home loan to upgrade their homes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Coalition Government is ensuring that the formalising work is not completed after upgrading but guaranteed homes are also improved to meet the appropriate standards for families and that is safe and resilient. HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, through you, I would like to ask the honourable Minister if he can also update Parliament on any programmes that complement the informal settlements upgrade programme?</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1790</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, parallel to the informal settlements upgrading project that is undertaken by the Ministry, we also has two on-going partner pilot projects that will assist to identify new approaches and best practices for the upgrade and development of informal settlements in Fiji. These two projects are the Fiji Resilient Informal Settlements (FRIS) as well as Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments commonly known as RISE. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also thankful to our development partners, the New Zealand Government as well as UN-Habitat for supporting these projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, RISE in Fiji involves 12 informal settlement sites. The project will be carried out in two phases with six sites in each phase. The successful implementation of the RISE programme will enable approximately 3,600 Fijians living in these 12 project sites to recycle their wastewater, harvest rain water, create green space for food cultivation, water cleansing, restore waterways to reduce vulnerability to flooding and strengthen climate resilience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, concurrently the Fiji Resilient Informal Settlement Programme is underway with 16 vulnerable families in informal settlements across four urban areas in Lautoka, Sigatoka, Nadi and Lami have been identified. The initial capital works under this project is expected to commence around November to December this year. Upon completion of these projects, it is going to benefit a total of 8,231 families with improved resilience to climate change effects. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his detailed response which I truly appreciate. In new Fiji, the cost of living has skyrocketed, even the cost of doing business has increased. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament whether the cost of land development has increased as a result of 15 percent VAT? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, even though it is not directed to the question but I will try and provide some response. The cost of land development is an issue that is not only related to VAT, it has other components that lead to the increase in development costs, especially in land development. It would not be right to say that it is only related to VAT. There are other factors apart from VAT that can lead to development costs. For example, if subdivision is held and if you look at the cost of consultancy, it has escalated over the past 10 years, as well as development costs associated to the consultancy fees is a good example, and these factors actually lead up to increased development costs around the country. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for providing an update on the formalisation of informal settlements. My question is, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament whether the Government will provide assistance to tenants if the current tenants are displaced from their settlements? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, may I respond to the question. For the last three weeks, I have been visited by two families who have been evicted from a settlement in Vatuwaqa and it is fortunate that we have been able to assist these families. I can assure them now that they are going to relocate them to two sites that we have already identified for them. We have a system in place to assist families that have been evicted or have been asked to relocate. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, honourable Kirpal has spoken and also written to say that the statement by the honourable Minister for Agriculture in the morning, right down to the details of the big bulls that he brought from Australia, has satisfied him, so his question will now be omitted from the Order Paper. We will now move on to the next Oral Question.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1791 (Question No. 121/2023 withdrawn) Promotion of Digital Literacy (Question No.122/2023) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the initiatives that the Ministry has undertaken to promote digital literacy and ensure that students have access to technology for remote learning, especially in light of recent disruptions to traditional education due to the pandemic? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker Sir, may I, first of all, seek your indulgence to unreservedly correct a statement I made yesterday, that was rebutted by honourable Hem Chand. Sir, my good friend, honourable Hem Chand, took up the acting head of HR in the Ministry of Education from January 2020. Prior to that promotional appointment, he held the position of Director Primary Education. He may have knowledge of all the appointments including Head of School and I leave it to his conscience of all the appointments that was made during his term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this time to sincerely apologise to his good wife if my statement yesterday may have brought harm upon her or her professional reputation. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of that, I promise to be more careful in the future with the information provided by staff of the Ministry of Education to be uttered in this august Parliament. Preferably, I would like to stay away from personal attack and for that, I sincerely regret any lowering of standards according to this august Parliament. Vinaka vakalevu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members of this Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for that brave position you have taken. Really, honourable Members, you do not have to personalise things. I want to implore that to each and every one of you. You may argue as hard as you like in the Chambers, but do not personalise anything and when you leave the Chambers, that is the end of it. You go as colleagues down to the tea room or where we have our meals and then we share the same table and discuss issues that we can play a part in solving. I thank you for that brave effort, honourable Minister. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question by the honourable Member, the COVID-19 pandemic has, indeed, disrupted traditional education for our children. This causes a shift towards remote learning and to ensure that students have access to technology and promote digital literacy. There were several initiatives that should have been taken, which have not been done and the Ministry of Education is now working hard to get this platform off the ground for all schools in Fiji. It is a huge target, given the intent to provide equitable learning for all our children and the challenges of our geographical locations especially for schools in the rural and maritime zones. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is engaged in various initiatives aimed to ensure that students have access to online learning, through technology which will allow them to engage in effective remote learning. By promoting digital literacy, educators and policy makers strive to equip students with essential skills for the future while minimizing educational disruptions during crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The future will demand that our learning platforms are ready for any evolving demands.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1792</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the lessons learnt so far, the Ministry of Education has engaged a number of platforms to boost e-learning and these include: 1. The “I am digital” initiative that educates students on online safety and this is being carried out in partnership with Save the Children Fiji, engaging student leadership bodies which has been piloted in 10 schools so far. 2. Another exciting platform is the "Girls in ICT training project”, which was conducted this year in collaboration with the Ministry of Trade and Communications. 3. Another initiative that is being undertaken by the Ministry of Education (MOE) with the University of the South Pacific is the development of 1500 Open Education Resources (OER) for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects. This is a government initiative in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 4. MOE is also developing an audio-visual studio with relevant stakeholders. We thank the Ministry of Finance for the budget of $100,000 in this financial year which has been allocated for this project. The studio will include six recording rooms for the following: (a) school broadcasting programmes; (b) production of education channel content; (c) airing of education channel lessons; (d) live lessons (distance learning) for our rural, remote and maritime schools; and (e) airing of recorded lessons. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Government is working to improve the Learning Management System which is currently in place and available through the Government ITC Services, and this will support the existing digital learning platforms being used in Early Childhood Education (ECE) up to Year 13 level for all schools in Fiji, to become more interactive. On support services made available through device learning, MOE is currently having discussions with stakeholders in having an end to end solution for this initiative. Students will be able to have devices with educational resources and platforms for their personal learning. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry to date has increased E-learning connectivity to schools, on an average of 57 percent throughout Fiji. Following the Ministry’s continued audits to access the current status in Fiji, the MOE is pushing for an increase in budget in the next financial year, so we can reach 100 percent connectivity so those children from rural, remote and maritime areas will be able to browse the web and use technology very different from what most of us had back in the early days. This requires a collaboration with internet service providers and it is something that the Ministry of Education is pushing to ensure that we are able to address the E-learning shortfalls currently existing, due to internet connectivity issues. HON. S. KIRAN.- Could you please update on education via the Walesi platform? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of Education is progressively working on available existing platforms like the - • Web-based learning hub in partnership with Telecom Fiji limited. • School broadcast programs. • Education Channel (Walesi). For this term external examination revision lessons will be aired from 5pm to 10pm in the afternoon and evening.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1793 Also, we have the Ministry of Education Moodle for Heads of Schools and teacher online training. This is an MOE talanoa forum for teachers and sharing of resources. We also have the web-based learning hub. This is a Fiji Open Education Resource done in partnership with the Commonwealth of Learning (COL) and provides an open web learning hub where specific subjects can be accessed for learning purposes. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir. Honourable Minister, you spoke about handing over the possibility or you forecasted to hand over devices to the students. Now that mitigates inequality, but to access devices you need data connection as well, so how would you monitor data misuse, and the misuse of these digital learning devices. If this would just be temporary for the period they would be in the schools and after that they probably would have to return, how would you monitor the misuse of data provided or the devices provided to the students and if it is given until that timeframe when they are in school. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, probably the question is asking about the challenges that we are confronted with as a Ministry of Education. One of the challenges that has been identified is the lack of resources with students, and also the connectivity to power supply. We also have lack of training with teachers and students and even parents who are necessary for the support system and ensuring such platforms are in workable arrangements. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to thank the honourable Minister for apologising for what he said yesterday. In fact, my wife was very disturbed yesterday, so thank you honourable Minister for that. My question to you is, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament whether teacher training institutions have incorporated digital training in their course? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his supplementary question. This is part of the items that will be dealt with in the National Education Summit that will be convened next week. MR. SPEAKER.- That brings us to the end of the Oral Questions. Before you proceed to the Written Question, honourable Members may I remind each and every one of us about the line of sight. When the honourable Minister for Education was on the floor, hopefully honourable Minister for Sugar, could have gone the other way around to take your seat rather than trying to come across this line sight from the Mr. Speaker, to whoever is on the floor. I say this out of respect because that is the kind of decorum that we observe and that we nurture very much in this Parliament. It might affect you as you stand and wait but that is the rule of Parliament and I hope this reminder will serve us well.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Labour Recruitment Firms (Question No.123/2023) HON.
