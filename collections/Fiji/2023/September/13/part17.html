<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this motion that is before the Parliament. At the outset Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will say that I am mindful of Standing Order 62(4)(d) where the words that you utter may incite racial violence or racial “ill-feelings” is the word. I have no intention at all and I ask honourable Members even on this side if you hear me saying something that is close to violating that rule, please raise a Point of Order so that I can withdraw. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all want a country that is united. A country that is prosperous, peaceful, the foundation for that country is stability, security and safety. And to be in a country that is totally united, very prosperous, totally peaceful, where the citizens are safe and secure and there is stability all around, is a dream; perhaps a utopian dream. Because if we look around the world, there is none. The closest, in my view, is the definition of heaven in the Christian Bible where everything is good. But it is a dream that we carry as the Government, as a Prime Minister, I am sure as the Speaker of the Parliament, as members of the Opposition; a dream that we carry as a father, grandfather, mother, grandmother. It is a dream that we carry even though utopian, but we carry it all the same. I would suggest that it is a dream that we should never ever discard. It has to be there because by it being there, we worked towards it. As we all know, modern nations are born out of some difficult circumstances, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The modern America was born out of the civil war, very much flavours their political landscape right now, and very much coming to the fore (left and right). We also had the circumstances where the modern Fiji was born and Mr. Speaker, people can take it as far back as to the myth that we migrated from Africa, we had this period where we were colonised, we were offered to be colonised. There was this period where we became independent and dominant of the Commonwealth, we were declared a Republic out of a coup and this is how the events that have saved us and that is the nation that we are today. But as we navigate through and every nation navigates through, through the circumstances and the events that come, problems begin to surface. This morning we heard the problem that we are facing about child abuse, problem that we should deal with, there is this problem of drugs, yesterday I heard honourable Tuinaceva talking about the carnage on our roads. These are problems that surface as we build this nation, utopian idea that it is the best nation surfaces any risk and these are the problems that Government deal with. But in all nations and almost all societies, there are deep-rooted problems that exist and regardless even of those deep-rooted problems, we still have that utopian dream that our country is peaceful, safe and secure, good for me now, good for my children and good for my grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before us defines the problem as, and I quote: “conflicting statements and utterances regarding motives behind the political upheaval”. That is the way the motion is worded and the end state that it desires is that closer and healing for Fiji is achieved and permanently put to rest. The way the motion is structured does not show a big problem, it is conflicting statements of events, how do you solve it? Deconflict the conflicting statements but I think we all know, what the problem is.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>1806 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a Western concept. We have our own and you understand it very well. For us the way we forgive begins from a perpetrator, he goes to the person that he hurt and asks for forgiveness, matanigasau, bulubulu and ours in the iTaukei is a ritual. It is a ritual when we go and ask for forgiveness, never starts from the person that was victimised to use the word, it always starts from the perpetrator, I know that I did wrong and then I go and do what I have to do according to our tradition and customs. In our culture when that is done you forgive and forget. An amazing part of our Fijian culture is the ability, after all is said and when that ritual is performed, we forgive and we forget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we talk about reconciliation, we talk about forgiveness. I will tell you a very quick story and my reaction. I know and I was watching the live church service that was done spearheaded by the Methodist Church where the Church sought forgiveness from the descendants of the Girmitiya, and I think, Qaselevu honourable Penioni Ravunawa was also there. I watched that and the exchanges and the words that were said. I am a member of the Methodist Church, I am the iVakatawa in the Church, and when the Methodist Church had their Conference lately, when they had the elections, and then when the Secretary General was elected, and they overlooked the descendant of the Girmitiya, I told myself “no”, what a wonderful opportunity to show that forgiveness that you sought from them, because all these years, the Deputy Secretary General has always been the next Secretary General and the optics to me was so wrong. I told myself, “Man, you just lost a wonderful opportunity to really show that forgiveness.” It is up to them, I will say, and I have no say in it, but I am just talking about the optics and my reaction to it. I am talking about the optics for me and I know that they have their own way of doing that. I am not saying that the election is wrong, I am just saying that that optics knowing that they had done that forgiveness church service before. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem we have is the divide that exists in our society, the divide along racial lines, and now there is even a bigger divide along political lines. There is that divide and I think the big task that we have is to try and narrow the gap as much as we can and we keep working on it and pull it together. In 2000, it was the first time I heard this word ‘ethnonationalism’, said to me by an officer, who is now doing the review of the GCC, Colonel Baledrokadroka. We were talking about why that is happening and he was sharing with me his thoughts along this idea of ethnonationalism, and why he thought that it was a big root cause of what was happening. That word stuck with me and I studied and read in to those that know things about ethnonationalism. I think that if you want our nation to come together as one, and we have proved, as mentioned by the honourable Kiran, the times when we can show that we unite when there is a rugby game on, we breathe as one and our heart beat beats as one; when a big disaster hits, we breathe as one and our heart beat beats as one. We can and it can be done, but it was only in those circumstances that just happened in Fiji, and this nation that utopian dream that we are dreaming about this nation is happening. We are getting there. We had three Olympic gold medals, this tiny nation of Fiji: one in the Paralympics, two in the main Olympics. I think the honourable Prime Minister wears one of the highest medal decorations from the French Foreign Legion, and that is because of the work that we do in the peacekeeping arena, we are considered one of the best in the world, this tiny nation best in the world when it comes to peacekeeping. We are getting there, we are building but I think that we need to tackle the deep- rooted problems that we have. We are equal and for me equal in the eyes of God starts from there, equality because we are</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1807 equal in the eyes of God. If that is the start point of our wanting to continue to build and working on that very utopian dream I think we will get there and I have no doubt that we will get there. I was amazed at the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he refers to him, “I am a British Hindu” not a Indo-British or a British of Indian decent. That is just the way he introduced himself - I am a British Hindu. It is equality Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we have the truth and reconciliation Commission you are opening up wounds of the past, it needs to be opened up, it needs to be treated so that it can heal. I would like to caution Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as we try and open the wounds of the past, treat it and get it healed and we must make sure that we are not creating wounds now. Equality that we strive for can be dealt with policies, policies that unite, policies that bring us together, policies that leave no person behind regardless of who he or she is. It can be dealt with laws that deal with us equally. I dream of a country not for me really, that utopian dream is not for me, this is mine, it is for my grandchildren, my children. I am grateful enough to see their faces and God has been favourable to me to allow me to live this long to see my grandchildren’s faces but I can only dream of the country of the Fiji that we live in right now and I have a dream of that country that I talked about where it does not matter where they come from, it does not matter that they come from the smallest island in Vatoa, it is closer to Tonga than to Suva. It does not matter that he is a Lauan, he lives or she lives in that country and on merit and the only thing that is important for him or her is to work hard and live your life. We can build that country, one day it will happen. We have to be tough, I think we have to be brave enough to face those deep rooted problems that plague our society, we have to be brave enough, it might cost us our political career but be brave enough to tackle it and put in place those policies, those laws that bring us together. I talked about political divide and I mentioned that it is widening, this is why I say it, when we see that most of the things that were put in place by the government of the past has been dismantled, it means also that the 200,000 people that voted for us you know I am feeling bad also because that is the reason why they voted and so our divide widens now. So, I plead that if you want and work on that utopian dream of this country that is prosperous, peaceful and stable, good for my grandchildren, good for your grandchildren we have to be tough and face those deep-rooted problems that we have. MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to honourable Tuicolo. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a short contribution towards the motion that is before Parliament. Mr. Speaker, why is there an urgency in the establishment of such Commission in the face of a socially cultural sick society? Mr. Speaker, are you aware that around 80 percent of deaths in Fiji this year alone are caused by Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and those numbers are still growing? Mr. Speaker, according to the Fiji Sun Editorial on 20 th July, 2023 the number of new HIV infections has surged by a staggering 260 percent since 2010 making Fiji the second fastest country in the Asia Pacific with the HIV epidemic. Mr. Speaker, teenage pregnancy has totalled to 1,279 from 2018 to 2021 between the ages of</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>1808 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 13 and 19. According to the Women Crisis Centre, children both boys and girls under 11 years old are indulging in sexual activities. Mr. Speaker, sexual offences numbers from the DPP’s office is very shocking with 768 cases in the year 2022. The youngest accused being a 12-year-old boy and the youngest victim being a 3 year old girl. Mr. Speaker, on 27 th February, 2015 Fiji was ranked fourth in percentage for searches of the word ‘porn’ and ninth for searchers of the word ‘pornography’. Mr. Speaker, I cannot blame children and youth alone. The parent must bear a bigger responsibility of what is happening in Fiji. The Bible clearly states in Proverbs 22:6 for parents to train their children while they are young. Mr. Speaker, we need to educate our adult population. We need to spend money in educating our adult population on parenting. According to the Signs of the Times monthly magazine dated on 24 th November, 1889: “If parents decide to teach their children self-control they must form the habit themselves. The scolding and fault finding of parents encourage a hasty passionate temper in the child”. Mr. Speaker, how far back should we go on this reconciliation agenda? The reconciliation must not be limited only to one event or period. Mr. Speaker, let us go back to the Girmit era when the last ship S. S. Sutlej carrying 888 labourers arrived on November, 1916. Some 42 ships made 87 voyages and carried about 60,000 labourers destined for the Colony of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, we all know when they were in the sugarcane plantation, they were treated like animals, beaten, poorly housed, meagre pay and long hours of work, poor medical facilities and poor educational arrangements for their children, shortage of women amongst labourers created a huge social problem, being confined like sardine in the ship laid to the breaking of the caste system and emergence of the Jahaji Bhai System. Mr. Speaker, after all those sacrifices and suffering the event of 14 th May, 1987 Fiji’s first military coup the Indo-Fijians were badly brutalised. This pain has traumatised the lives and minds of Indo-Fijians. This shattered the economy of Fiji. Many fled the shores of Fiji to settle in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America. This began the flights of capital and skills from Fiji. Mr. Speaker, sincere thanks to the FijiFirst Government which has given all Fijians a common name and sense of belonging and respect. Fijians of Indian descent are no longer treated as vulagi under the 2013 Constitution, they continue to play a vital role in the economy of this country. We must also consider the unfair treatment done to our people in Navosa during the little war in 1876 where many of our people and chiefs were either killed or exiled to the other parts of Fiji. A good example are the people of Colo-West who are in Koro, perhaps this is one of the areas where the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should start from.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1809 Mr. Speaker, we must also remember that in 1944 there were 13 provinces in mainland Viti Levu. During the reorganisation of that year Nadi, Lautoka, Colo-North, Colo-East and Colo-West Provinces were scrapped and dropped. This is one of the biggest blunders and injustices done to the iTaukei administration in the Western part of Viti Levu. Why combine the Nadi Province, Lautoka Province and Ba Province together with vast land and natural resources and keeping Rewa and Tailevu intact? Perhaps, it was purposely done to undermine or weaken the West. While the Eastern bloc are unaffected, the ill- conceived westerners continue to be satisfied with the present arrangement. Mr. Speaker, we in Navosa are still asking whatever government to come into power to release us from Nadroga. More than 20 tabua have been used since 1987 to request for the separation. On Thursday, 27 th May, 1999, Navosa Province have been granted to become a separate and fifteenth province of Fiji. The Permanent Secretary of Fijian Affairs that time, the late Ratu Meli Bainimarama assured in Navosa chiefs that he would work on other aspects and requirements before the declaration of Navosa as the fifteenth province. Mr. Speaker, we are now still eagerly waiting for the Emancipation Day. That is where the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should focus on. It appears that this motion is geared towards a camouflage of a sinister agenda of an iTaukei utranationalist propaganda. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Come on! HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, we should not regard this proposed Reconciliation Commission as relevant for Fiji just because it has been used in other countries with very different settings. Do we really need to establish this Truth and Reconciliation Commission when the FijiFirst Government through the 2013 Constitution has already bandaged and healed the wound? What we are doing today is just re-opening the wound. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What happened to 2000? HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I beg you please… MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- ... leave everything as it is because the healing has already taken place:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, we are touching a very sensitive topic and I ask for your co-operation, let us hear them up. That is the very heart of what is being introduced here. Please let us show some maturity and let us listen. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the motion on hand. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, what is our priority at this time? Putting bread on the table, bus fare increases, trying ways to decrease it, the high cost of living for our society or our people, crime is on the rise, farmers are struggling with the high cost of inputs and mass exodus of our population to greener pastures which is Australia and New Zealand and others. These are the key important priorities I feel that we as representatives of the people need to discuss and try to resolve it, not using this much needed resources into establishing a Commission which does nothing to address the basic needs. Why do we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission? These Commissions are set up after a period of oppression or conflict. There has not been a conflict recently. Why do we need to set up a Commission now? Which period are we discussing, are we only discussing the first coup, the second coup or everything from Independence until now or are we discussing issues prior to</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>1810 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 Independence? It is a can of worms, if you open one, everything will spill out, there are a lot of things need to be discussed, so we need to set our priorities right. How many times are we going to say sorry? If one’s apology is sincere and genuine, then one sincere apology is good enough; looks like all these apologies which we have been getting is just a show. If it was a sincere apology, that should have been enough, but it is not. If you talk about the events of the first and second coups, a lot of us have lost our livelihoods, our dear ones and to some extent our identity. Do people think that simply setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a simple sorry will set it right? No, it will not. I personally lost my dad because of the coups. No matter how many commissions you set, no matter how reconciliations you do, that gap in my life will remain and no amount of sorry will fill that gap. We cannot reconcile if some of the citizens of Fiji are referred to or called visitors, not matter in which language it is called, that is not reconciliation. We cannot achieve reconciliation if equal employment opportunities is not provided to all citizens. One has to look at the recent appointments, it clearly spells out, I do not know why people are so silent about it. Reconciliation will never be achieved if policies are leaned towards one particular ethnic community or a division. Policies should be set to benefit all citizens of Fiji, not only one particular group or ethnicity. There are a lot of ways we can reconcile without setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. If one wants to reconcile in this society then we should follow the Constitution of Fiji. A lot of decisions, a lot of actions are being taken that does not concur with the Constitution. This Constitution is what bridges the gap in the society and recognises every citizen equal. If one is to genuinely reconcile, then your actions on the ground should be more important than what the commissions or establishments we want to make. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is human nature that if one approaches or touches a scorpion, he has to take care, he has to be very careful, he needs to understand. By nature, the scorpion will sting, and for us to reconcile, the attitude of the scorpion needs to go. Before sitting, Sir, I would like to conclude by quoting from the same play the honourable Prime Minister has quoted, the last words Julius Caesar said before he was stabbed to death “Et tu Brute?” which means, “You too Brutus?” HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my views on the motion before the House. At the outset, let me reiterate that what we need in this country is not a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but political maturity, adherence to the rule of law, compliance with the 2013 Constitution and recognising that Fiji is a multi-racial and multi-religious country. Constant echoes of divide is made by the leaders who should be healing the divide. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it hurts when Indo-Fijians are called vulagi. Is this reconciliation? Where is political maturity? We have heard the honourable Prime Minister apologising to Girmityas and he has done it many times. After barely a few months later, he calls the same people he apologised to as vulagi. The main reason is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we came after. So, the whole debate is, who came first? People who came here have passed away. I did not come with my great grandparents. My parents were born here, I was born here. Apologies will not heal or reconcile, and a living example is our honourable Prime Minister, he has been apologising but doing the opposite. Words and actions matter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have heard from honourable Naupoto, after the Methodist Church sought forgiveness, they did the opposite. It is the words and actions that matter. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Constitution provides all Fijians irrespective of one’s race,</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1811 religion, cast or creed, it gives us equal citizenry. And then whatever I have discussed now is the same government that brings in a motion to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This is where I feel that as leaders, we lack maturity, we are not responsible for the words that we say. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we look around the world, there are a few countries that have established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Why are few countries? It is because they had very serious issues of human rights violation, civil wars, atrocities, persecutions, child abuse and very serious social injustices. Whatever it was, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established for a specific purpose to investigate a single matter. Below are few examples: • South Africa - to transition from apartheid to democracy. • Peru - human rights abusers suffered during internal arm conflicts of 1980s and 1990s. • Sierra Leone - addressing war crimes and human rights abuses during the civil war. • Timor-Leste - human rights abuses committed during the Indonesian occupation. • Mauritius - to determine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentured labourers. • Nepal - investigation of disappeared persons. • Liberia - violence and human rights abuses during Liberia’s civil war. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question I have are outlined below: 1. Are we going to back to 1879, the commencement of Girmit as Mauritius did? 2. Are we going to go back to the first coup in Fiji in 1987? 3. Are we going to go back to the overthrow of the Chaudhry government in 2000? 4. Mutiny in 2000 or the overthrow of the Qarase government in 2006? The question is, why are we trying to open the wounds, Mr. Speaker Sir? In some cases, as the saying goes, time heals. I believe that establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is more to deviate attention from the real issues facing the country – the underlying issues of economic inequality. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as leaders, we should be focusing mainly on policies where we can grow our economy and we can look after the disadvantaged in our community. We should be focusing on economic growth and developing policies that will assist in bringing in equality in this country. If we are able to achieve that then we will not have such issues that we a discussing today. In a small country like Fiji, establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission gives a signal to the world that we do have some serious issues. This will have a negative impact on investor confidence or even consumer confidence, having huge impact on our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the main challenges of establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is the danger of political manipulation. The Government might use it to selectively investigate the political opponents while protecting their own interest which can undermine the impartiality and credibility of such a Commission and there are many cases available which talks about impacts, effectiveness of Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it is advisable that we should be on top of what has happened in other countries before we even adopt this. Mr. Speaker Sir, it can also lead to the provision of a form of amnesty or leniency for those who have committed serious crimes. This Coalition Government continues to disregard the Constitution, the rule of law. They are pursuing their agenda without proper legal procedures which</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>1812 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 poses significant threat to the stability and integrity of the nation and this is what we all should be focusing on. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission often rely on voluntary testimony which means that not all individuals with relevant information may come forward. Some perpetrators may choose not to testify leading to an incomplete picture of the truth. Witnesses may be afraid to speak openly due to fear of the reprisals, victims will also have a high expectation that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will provide them with justice or compensation but if these expectations are not met it can lead to disillusionment and disappointment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must pause and ask ourselves whether Fiji has that level of human rights violation, abuses, atrocities and political persecutions. Our issues are not as extensive and serious as we have seen in countries where Truth and Reconciliation Commissions have been established. What Fiji needs is further strengthening of the institutions that are there to protect all Fijians from human rights abuses, racial and other discrimination. We must make this institution totally independent of any political interference. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a Constitution that guarantees our fundamental rights and recognise all citizens as equal. We should work towards political maturity and acceptance. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you want to achieve a better nation for our children and our grandchildren, we need to address the underlying issues. The underlying issues in my view is lack of political maturity and economic inequality. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is an important motion that we have in Parliament as you earlier mentioned it touches our heart and in totality, we cannot deal with it with our own physical strength. I read to us a scripture passage from the Bible - Philippians 2: 3-4: “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking at your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. Humility allows us to approach reconciliation with a willingness to listen, to learn, to acknowledge our shortcoming. Mr. Speaker, Sir, first for me personally when I am putting my head around this motion presented before Parliament, in my personal opinion, it is poorly worded and it can have several immediate and long-term effects. Poorly worded motions can often bring confusion and misinterpretation. It can also give us a difficult time as Parliamentarians, to fully understand the intended purpose or implications of the proposed motion. This confusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may result in honourable Members voting in favour or against something that we do not fully grasp. If a motion is poorly worded it may also fail to meet the necessary procedural requirements. First and foremost, the honourable Members of Parliament, due to its unclear and ambiguous nature, lacks to support that can undermine the credibility of parliament, credibility of Government and weaken its ability to effectively advance its agenda. In extreme cases, Mr. Speaker, Sir, poorly worded motions can raise legal and legislative concerns. If the language used in a motion is vague or contradictory it may create legal loopholes of conflict with existing laws. This can lead to legal challenge and costly revision to rectify the issues, and also public perception and accountability. A poorly worded motion can impact the Government’s image and perception. It may be seen as a sign of incompetence or negligence. It can erode public trust and confidence in Government’s</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1813 ability to govern effectively. It’s an important juncture that we are in this afternoon - we can be setting precedents. In looking at the motion itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it requires careful consideration of language, the legal requirements, potential interpretations or the consequences of this motion. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the Fijian Constitution of 2013 includes provision of truth and reconciliation. It is important to note that the decision to establish a commission for truth and reconciliation is often based on a specific circumstance of the country or the community. Mr. Speaker, our Constitution gives Rights to all Fijians. We are all equal in the eyes of God and also in the eyes of the Law and we are united in this country for a common purpose. Every Fijian is equal. We are equal in accessing justice through the courts. We are equal with our Right to equality and freedom from discrimination. That is the basis of the 2013 Constitution. If it is already there, duplicating a legislation, it can have a detrimental effects to our nation. In duplication a legislation can lead to redundancy and confusion within the legal framework. It may create over-lapping provision and inconsistent legal interpretation, causing difficulties in implementing and enforcing the law effectively. Mr. Speaker Sir, duplicating a legislation with a specific purpose or significant amendment can be a waste of resources and time. It needs careful consideration in order to avoid under-mining the principles of legal certainty. Regarding to the proposed and reconciliation Bill tabling in Parliament today, Mr. Speaker Sir, it is essential to once again evaluate its objectives, provisions, the potential impact before concluding whether it constitutes duplicative legislation or not, or if the Bill aims to address specific gaps or issues that are not already covered in the existing legislation. Ultimately, it is crucial for law and policy makers to carefully assess the necessity, implications and duplicating legislation to ensure the legal framework remain clear, efficient and representative of the communities need. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the brag of the Fiji 2013 Constitution and the pathway and framework of the people’s charter for building a better Fiji, we have done well to ourselves. I believe honourable Kiran, the mover of the motion, herself has testimonies and good stories that she can testify to the transformation that took place in the event of exchange with the vanua of Navilaca in Noco, and the elevation accorded to the descendants of the Girmitiyas to the esteemed position of luvena na turaga na ratu. All those exchanges and transformations took place without the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Fiji is blessed, not because of the sun, sea and the sand, but because in the early 1800s, when missionaries first came to the nation, they brought with them the Gospel message that our forefathers embraced, and that is why we are different. We can easily forgive and move along. I will end there. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will start by quoting the honourable Prime Minister, as well as myself on what we said during the Girmit Commemoration and Reconciliation Service organised by the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma at the Vodafone Dome on Sunday, 14 th May this year. This is relevant to the debate on the need for Parliament to agree to the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This is not a Bill, as stated by honourable Ravunawa, this is a motion to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. All the motion seeks to do is to ask Parliament to agree to the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission so that we can have some debate and discussions as to what it will amount to. Obviously, the terms of reference and the appointment by the President of the Commission will be after Parliament agrees.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>1814 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 The honourable Prime Minister, while confessing his wrongdoing in 1987, and asking for forgiveness, said, and I quote: “We confess our wrongdoings, we confess that we have hurt so many of our people in Fiji, particularly those of our Indo-Fijian communities at the time, and amongst them were sons and daughters of those who were indentured labourers from India between 1879 and 1916. The power to forgive is beyond our human power. The power to forgive is godly. As you forgive you release us and you are released. You are released from hatred, from your anger and we begin to feel the peace of God coming to our beings and our lives”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will quote what I said on that momentous day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I quote: “This may well be the start of resetting the moral compass of our nation and repairing the social moral and political fabric so badly needed to forge a united and harmonious future. More importantly, what Fiji and our diaspora have just witnessed has sowed the seeds for a truth and reconciliation commission so critically needed to put a permanent closure to an ugly chapter of upheavals. Once and for all it will put an end to those whose political ambitions devolve around invoking fear and ill-will by fanning the flames of racism. The courage and humility of the Methodist Church in apologising for the hurt, pain and suffering caused to the descendants of the Girmitiya community by the iTaukei community should be an eye opener to those who have participated in the political upheavals but continued to defend their role.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support this historic motion and this, if I may state, is a National Federation Party motion, seconded by the honourable Prime Minister as the Leader of the People’s Alliance Party and also supported by the SODELPA Party and its leader. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion was entrusted to what I say an Indo-Fijian woman of the National Federation Party, the party that I lead by us in the Coalition Government including the Prime Minister and to which honourable Sashi Kiran did not hesitate to do. The issue of harmonious race relations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a long held question that she herself, has toiled in her previous role as an NGO leader. I must say Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kiran is a perfect example of someone who has learned to confront her own fears, not by castigating others or playing the blame game but by making an honest effort to understand the wishes, aspirations, and fears of other races or ethnic groups. That is why honourable Sashi Kiran is such a passionate advocate Sir, of luvedra na Ratu mai Noco, Rewa. We have heard before that the Commission is a pre-requisite Mr. Speaker, Sir, to genuine healing which is crucial to our effort to make Fiji a land of hope and opportunity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may not be aware that in confirmative to the National Federation Party’s principles and the party they tried to move a similar motion in Parliament during its sitting in April 2017, and of course that motion was not allowed. Six years later Mr. Speaker, Sir, under your leadership we are kind of putting a rest to our ghosts and essentially laying the foundation for what a nation wants to bequeath to our future generations. That too Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you said earlier this morning without promoting or provoking ill-will or any kind of hostility and pinging upon the rights and freedoms of our people. I think, Mr. Speaker, a Commission is necessary for us as Fijians to come to terms with the past and there is quite a lot. Some have gone in Girmit days, others have gone even before that</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1815 because we need to accept this on a morally accepted basis and to advance the cause of reconciliation somewhere. I know it is not a secret that attempts to reconcile the past efforts to encourage truth telling, confessing our wrongdoings or even apologising to the victims of political upheavals were turned into political football and band standing and that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are aware. For many years truth telling and taking ownership of mistakes that have robbed the nation had actually disappeared. And until 14 th May, 2023, Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of the Girmit Day reconciliation organised by the Methodist Church, no racial intolerance but love, respect and sound of goodwill, understanding and mutual peaceful co-existence. The Fiji Forward Declaration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that occasion that we signed cemented our resolve to work together and the leaders of political parties without any fear or racial prejudice. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that some may argue as we have heard that the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission will open old wounds impede progress. However, Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that true confronting are passed. We can actually find a way for a brighter and more harmonious future. Sometimes confronting the past, discussing the past, what happened in the past can lead to a better future, it can shine light on truth. We have heard mentioned deep rooted, underlying mistrust, prejudice, divisions that hinder us moving forward. I know the South African experience has been mentioned. The South African experience, Mr. Speaker, demonstrated the transformative power of collective truth telling and forgiveness. It kind of provided a blueprint for healing, unity and growth. Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to some of the points that have been raised before. I think, honourable Naupoto was right when he was talking about stability, security, he related those two issues. If you look at Fiji, Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago we were better than Mauritius on all indicators: economics, social indicators and some of us were wondering why Fiji cannot be the Mauritius of the Pacific. A lot of the research, studies and my own research on Mauritius with comparison to Fiji shows that the respect for rule of law, democracy but more importantly the social cohesion. Mr. Speaker, we talked about law, I know the honourable Members from the other side talked about rule of law - the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is no sense of purpose, unity, trust between different communities if there are prejudices, mistrust than any law you cannot legislate these things. We have seen four constitutions in this country. The 1970 Constitution was agreed to by the then NFP leader and the leader of the Alliance Party. It was in many ways a negotiated Constitution, it provided a Bill of Rights, it provided a system of government where all those principles were embedded. But that Constitution was thrown out. Then we had the 1990 Constitution which was imposed. Then the honourable Prime Minister showed leadership with the other political leaders and got the 1997 Constitution which actually provided power-sharing. It was more a concessional type of politics where power sharing was made a law. Yet Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Constitution was also thrown out. Then we had the 2013 Constitution imposed on the people of Fiji. It might be the best constitution in the views of people or the population; a sizeable section of the population. We have heard about laws and policies, yes laws and policies are important. I heard Members talked about issues. Yes, those are issues that we need to deal with whether it is drugs, NCD, economic growth, poverty or lack of economic growth, these things do not happen in a vacuum.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>1816 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this motion is a great opportunity. This is not about hiding something as the honourable Prime Minister said and he is absolutely right. If there is anything in this Parliament amongst us right now, it is something that he would, but he is showing the wisdom saying let us talk about it. If there is a dispute in any small family household setting, if the people are not getting on and if you do not talk about it, if you try and hide it under some kind of law and policy, it will never work. It has never worked in any country. Honourable Kumar talked about political maturity - yes, this is political maturity. This is political maturity that we, as Members of Parliament, are prepared to talk about what happened in the past. We are showing courage as Members of Parliament. But if you say, “look, we do not want to talk about this, we want to go by some law that everyone should respect without addressing the underlying principles, without talking about how we can merge our interest, how we can enhance social cohesion at all levels”, Mr. Speaker. Sir, you cannot guarantee and you cannot satisfy. I think the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is also about education. We cannot continue to be cantankerous in our expressions of views that we hold very strongly at a personal level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, personally we were all part of it in terms of opposing, talking about democracy, talking about human rights. There are a lot of human right violations that took place in the last so many year. Whether you are talking about 1987, 2000, 2006 people died after the human rights were violated. Some waited for 10 to 15 years to come back to their own country. These are all issues there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is a great opportunity for this Parliament to talk about these things. It is not about opening old wounds. The old wounds are there and we keep talking about those wounds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Premila Kumar talked about confidence that this will somehow share our confidence. In fact what this motion will do if the honourable Members of the Opposition give this a bipartisan support this will be a defining moment for this country, Mr. Speaker, this will spur confidence, this will bring that sense of freedom and exuberance in the ability of our country and everyone knows it is not true that Fiji is not recognised as a country where there are issues and we keep talking about it here in Parliament as well. When we were in Opposition, we talked about it. Some people say about the Constitution, honourable Tikoduadua talked about how the Police Force was totally racialised in terms of 90 percent of the officers coming from a one particular group. It happened under the 2013 Constitution so it is not always about law, not always about policies, you can have the best Constitution, you can have the best law, you can think about the best policies but if there no sense of unity, purpose, understanding each other’s sensitivities, fears, expressions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will not be able to. I am not saying, the mover of the motion is not saying that we will solve all the problems tomorrow after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. No one is saying that, but Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be a great opportunity for us not only as honourable Members of Parliament but because when you talk about political maturity and what people see below, comes from that political maturity, that ability to get together and talk about issues. So Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I urge the honourable Members on the Opposition side not to forgo this opportunity. This is going to be an historic bipartisan opportunity to work together. We may not agree with all the pluses and minuses of having the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but at least we would have tried altogether collectively to move towards a situation where we are able to come together and talk about these issues and move forward. I strongly commend this motion to all the honourable Members of this Parliament.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1817 HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the honourable Members of this Parliament, I thank the honourable Opposition Members for their contributions to this motion. I stand before you to shed light on the dark side of the proposed Truth and Reconciliation Commission as presented by the Coalition Government. While the intention may seem noble, we must confront the potential damaging consequences that this endeavour might inflict upon our people. First and foremost, we cannot ignore the harsh reality that Truth and Reconciliation Commission has the potential to reopen wounds that have barely healed. It is not just the matter of reliving the past traumas, it is a cruel reminder of the pain our fellow Fijians endured. This process could be traumatising for countless victims, leaving scars that may never truly heal. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us also consider the financial burden placed on our already strained resources. Establishing and maintaining such a Commission is an expensive endeavour. At a time when our nation faces economic challenges, should we really prioritise initiative that may drain our coffers? Should we not be focusing on immediate needs of our Fijians instead? Furthermore, there is a grave risk that this Truth and Reconciliation Commission may become a platform for political manipulation. The Government with all its power and influences could use this Commission to promote its own agenda and selectively target individuals or groups potentially deepening the divisions within our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must also recognise that Truth Commissions by design, do not possess the power to prosecute perpetrators, and this raises the question of accountability. Will those responsible for heinous crimes simply be allowed to walk free and their sins forgiven in the name of reconciliation? Is this justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Let us not be naïve about the willingness of all the stakeholders to participate. The scars of the past run deep and some may choose not to engage with the Commission. Will their voices be silenced, and their stories left untold? Is that the kind of reconciliation we truly seek? Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission because today the Fijian people already stand more united than at any other point in their history and that is owed to the unprecedented state of civil, political, socio-economic rights and a sign of all time in our beloved 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. For those who do not know our Constitution unlike those on that side of Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, and past governments before, FijiFirst knows that the only true path to unity is through equality. That belief and commitment is defined given everything Fiji has achieved under the FijiFirst government and the leadership of the former Prime Minister Bainimarama. In the very Preamble of the Fijian Constitution states clearly that we are all Fijians, united by a common and equal citizenry and because of our Constitution, for the first time in our history, we are all equal in the eyes of the law and united with a common purpose. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members because of our Constitution, every Fijian knows that their vote and voice matter the same, that all our citizens are equal, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, gender, physical ability or where they live in Fiji and that is the truth the Fijian people deserve; the truth the FijiFirst Government was able to make a reality. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Constitution also recognises the right of indigenous Fijians, the iTaukei and the Rotuman people. It guarantees the ownership and protection of their land and the unique culture, traditions, customs and language. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the same Constitution every Fijian has equal access to justice through the courts or tribunals, executive and administrative justice, freedom of speech, expression and publication, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, the</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>1818 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 right to fair employment practices, the right to equality and freedom from discrimination, freedom from compulsory, acquisition of property, the right to education and economic participation, the right to work and a just minimum wage, the right to reasonable access to transportation, the rights of children and the rights of persons with disabilities and the list goes on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the basis of unity, that is a Fiji for every Fijian and with the foundation of equality in place, FijiFirst embarked on a programme of Legal and Policy Reform that has uplifted every Fijian from all walks of life all across our nation. We have achieved eight straight years of economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, we have made education free. FijiFirst have built a network of reliable infrastructure and services throughout the country. We had formed our first National University, we had expanded access to scholarship and affordable tertiary loans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst has done all that because we had adhered to the mandate setup by the Fijian Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst had achieved such success because for the first time in Fijian history, we can say with every confidence that our unity is our strength. We have no bounds that divides our society that the past governments sought to entrench. We had levelled the playing field for every Fijian and we have put greater opportunity in the lives of all our people everywhere in our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while on the subject of truth, I see great irony in the Coalition Government which is posing this motion when they themselves are so blind to the true history of our country. They ask about truth and reconciliation while they themselves live in denial of the truth. Mr. Speaker, they live in denial of the years of institutionalised discrimination and systematic oppression of our fellow Fijians that crippled our nation for decades. FijiFirst had recognise the dark part of our history and we have come to grips with the grim reality that was faced by far too many Fijians for far too long. Mr. Speaker, Fijians who felt unwelcomed in their own homes and those on the margins of society were excluded from meaningful participation in their country. FijiFirst recognised the immense harm those years caused and our leader, Mr. Bainimarama had made it his personal mission to ensure that Fiji never slips back into those lost years. It is our Constitution and the strong and independent institutions that establishes and guarantees equality in our society. It is equality that unites us as one nation, one people. That is the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and armed with the truth. We will continue to carry Fiji into the future. While reconciliation is a noble aspiration, we must be cautious about the potential negative repercussions of establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We must consider the emotional toll on our people, the financial strain on our nation, the risk of political manipulation, the lack of accountability and the potential silencing of voices. Mr. Speaker, let us trend carefully on this path for the road to reconciliation is fraught with uncertainties and potential pitfalls that could harm our beloved Fiji and its people. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Koya, I intend to adjourn Parliament now. I have been informed that dinner is ready and probably after having your meal then we shall come and finish off the day’s agenda. The Parliament adjourned at 6.12 p.m.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1819 The Parliament resumed at 7.30 p.m. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before the House is asking the House to setup a Truth and Reconciliation Commission so that a lot of things can be done but it is not very specific in its form at the moment. It has been badly drafted. It is asking literally to facilitate open, free engagement truth telling and confront fears in view of conflicting statements and utterances regarding motives behind political upheavals so that closure and healing for Fiji is achieved and permanently put to rest this unfortunate turbulent chapter of our independent history. Mr. Speaker, we have a history, we have quite a substantial and how history goes back to, not just the upheavals from 1987 and onwards, but also during Colonial times for which I am sure you are aware of. I can speak a little bit on that because of my family and I mean my father, the late honourable S. M. Koya who sat in this very chair during Colonial times and also during Independence. He was someone who also went through the Colonial times and fought hard. I can relay a story about how they were treated then by the Colonial rulers of Fiji at that time. He and a very famous man from Ba, for those of you from Ba would remember, his name was Sashi Mahendra Singh. They used to go across to the Grand Pacific Hotel and put their money on the table to try and get a room, only to be chased out of there because they were coloured. We are all coloured but today we are all Fijians irrespective of colour. That kind of persecution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, led them to be strong, led them to be patriotic and it led them to work hard to develop this great nation of ours. Despite our frailties and difficulties, they never asked for any Truth and Reconciliation Commission to move forward. Their philosophy then was if you got burnt, you are left with a scar that you had to witness for the rest of your life, you cannot remove it; the same principle applies here. We have scars all over this country, but we will never ever be able to remove that, but we must put that at the back of our minds and move forward. We cannot dig it up some more, we cannot allow this to happen. Mr. Speaker, truth be told, if you really want the truth, why do you need a Commission? If you really want reconciliation, go no further then how we culturally do it. We have a system culturally within the indigenous folk who actually have a reconciliation system that we all used all the time for literally everything. A lot of that has been done already in the churches amongst our families. Even the honourable Prime Minister, I am sure his testament to the fact that so many have actually happened. Why is it that we actually keep digging this up again and again? I want to correct few things also. Mr. Speaker, the honourable Professor Biman Prasad said that he had somewhat, I think it was 2021 that he said, he did as for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> In 2017.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> … to Parliament. He said that Fiji needs a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for truth telling to bring a closure to the traumatic events arising out of our four military coups. He said it was grossly unjust, unfair and most unreasonable that people especially those subjected to unlawful detention, harassment, torture and abused by the security forces especially the military are prevented from seeking justice and compensation. That was the core basis of that application. Many people who championed democracy and human rights were victims of torture and abused by the military, and I quote:</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>1820 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 “Following the 1987 coup pro-democracy activists were also subjected to detention. Some were tortured after 2000 coup, many became victims of violence committed by those supporting the mayhem.” He went on to say that the 2013 Constitution entrenched the limitation of liability for the Limitation of Liability for Prescribed Political Events Decree 2010 which means the alleged perpetrators of violence of human rights abuse cannot be brought to justice. We do not know what the reasoning is behind this particular motion because they have not said anything. His also spoken about compensation. We do not know. I am not labelling any accusation here, I am just saying that we do not know what is being sought here. What I must point out with the greatest of respect to the former speaker, Sir, who sat in that very chair who ruled that the motion was inadmissible under the Standing Orders because debate of the motion would be likely to promote and provoke feelings of ill-will or hostility between the different communities in Fiji. Further, the motion was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights of the 2013 Constitution. That fact, when you talk about something like that, you ought to tell the full story, Sir. That was his reasoning for not allowing that motion. It is there. Mr. Speaker, we have heard some very passionate speeches today, but I think it is very important today that we speak freely and everyone is heard. What is being asked of us is that we agree to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Mr. Speaker, the truth is this book, the reconciliation is this book, and I will tell you why. We all take the Preamble in this Constitution for granted but that Preamble tells us that we recognise the indigenous people or the iTaukei and their ownership of the land, culture and customs, tradition and language. We recognise the indigenous people of Rotuma, similarly to them, we recognise the unique culture, customs, traditions and language. We also recognise the descendants of the indentured labourers from British India and the Pacific Islands, their culture, customs, traditions and language. We also recognise the descendants of the settlers and immigrants to Fiji, their cultures and customs. There is another line in there, Mr. Speaker, that basically puts everything to rest and gives us all an equal footing. This Preamble declares that we are all Fijians, united, Mr. Speaker, by common and equal citizenry. Mr. Speaker it also has a Bill of Rights that protects literally everything. We must respect this book that we swore on. We swore on oath on it. This book is the very reason why we all sit here. This book allows us to have elections. This book allows us to have this particular debate that we are having now, but we must not start by saying in the first 7 months – “Oh! Let’s dig up the past and let us set up a truth and reconciliation committee”. We don’t even have the ambit of what you are actually trying to put before this Parliament. There were so many parts and parcels to this particular idea that it actually does not make sense. Again, historically Sir, in 2005 also this is during the Qarase Government, there was a reconciliation and unity commission that was proposed by the Government then to be set up. If the reconciliation tolerance and unity built which was introduced in the Fiji Parliament on the 4 th of May, 2005 was passed but guess what Mr. Speaker, Sir, that also was shelved because it created havoc amongst the community or they proved it really did. It was going to create problems and animosity in Fiji. What are we trying to do? Are we going to do that again?</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1821 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will go back to what I said earlier that we as the people are probably the most reconciling human beings on earth in Fiji. We have the ability to talk to each other even by different means. We resolve disputes. We taught the climate change conference how to have a talanoa session and resolve disputes. Why is it that we need a truth and reconciliation committee at a great huge expense? Why is it that all we need to do is protect this constitution adhere to this constitution and rely on this constitution, because we swore an oath on this particular book. This is all we need. There are other ways we can do many things like we do, we are champion around the world for having a system within our cultural system to be able to protect our environment. Mr. Speaker, every time you set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and this was spelt out by the speakers before, many countries do this, but normally the TRC’s they don’t have any powers to prosecute perpetrators. They make recommendation and we understand it, to prevent future abuses, but generally speaking these bodies are established straight out of a period of unrest. We have gone out 16 years of no unrest, we have had economic growth in such a phenomenal way. In a matter of fact, if you look at it in reality sir, in 1987 those who would remember that are probably over 40-plus now, we have such a young population. A lot of healing has gone on. During election time, these racial insults that you talk about now rears its ugly head because it is a ploy that is used, it is not just here but it is worldwide. But deep down inside, the level of patriotism we have in this country right now because of what has been created by this blue book, is unsurpassed, it is unbelievable! I will share a little light moment with you, honourable speaker. When Fiji plays rugby - just now we played Wales but, unfortunately, we lost and guess what? Every single person in this country was Fijian, we had a gentleman whose name is Hamzad Hussain, he took his little flag from Labasa, and he was in the stadium in France and guess what his sign read? He was so disappointed because Fiji had lost and guess what his sign read (I hope you understand this Hindustani part). He said, “ referee murgi chor”, which means that the referee was a chicken thief. Patriotism Sir, he did not look at who was playing and who was not playing, it is about Fiji. All of that exists under this Constitution. We are not at a stage where a Truth and Reconciliation Committee is required. The honourable Prime Minister has gone and apologised millions of times already. Any more truth to be told, why do you need the Commission? Why do we need to dig up scars some more? Is that going to heal? No Sir. Like a gentleman who shall remain nameless, who served sometime in prison said to me one day, one minute of incarceration is a lifetime of memory. Is that not enough? The effectiveness of having a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission (TCR) has varied from country to country. The success actually depends on many different factors but all these have not been factored in or it would seem to me that not much thought has been given to the actual motion before the Parliament. Previously, there was a Bill that came first, but again I reiterate Sir, there is no need for us to have a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this motion will effectively divide Fiji again. It is divisive Sir. We have healed a lot. We have a lot of differences here, we carry on with business as usual. We do not need a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Committee here in Parliament because we have got so many differences. Of course, we have differences, this country has gone through and had enough trials and tribulations to last us 20 lifetimes. We have got a phenomenally young population, some (I apologise honourable Prime Minister) do not even know what transpired and they asks us what actually happened? It is not a lie, that is the truth. We have young people who want to move forward. We start digging up some more, what is going to happen? We are going to be divisive again.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>1822 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the experiences that have come out of TRCs have been set up worldwide, I know South Africa did one. It is very hurtful Sir – hurtful to the extent that there are provisions in the Constitution that say you cannot be prosecuted, nor you can be compensated and all of the coup perpetrators that did them before all had them. What is the purpose? If you want the truth, just say it, why do you need the commission? Why do we need to set up a 22 to 30 men commission to do this? What will be the ultimate objective of this particular Truth and Reconciliation Commission especially in light of the fact that you do not need to go any further. This book (2013 Constitution) is the truth, this book is the reconciliation. We all must have the political will and the nous to say we need to move forward. We need to protect ourselves by putting in new laws, new policies and it can be done. You have seen in your time Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have seen some great achievements this week. We have been able to do things with agreement on both sides. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a son of Fiji, I was born here. My father was born here. I do not need to reconcile with anyone because everyone here (to me) is Fijian. I do not need to tell the truth to anyone because I already have, whether it is good or bad. Sir, there are times when we sit down and we have a conversation awe all hurt but it does not need this Committee for it to be dragged up even if it is history. Sir, our students, our young people, we learn through history that this is something which should not be done. We have healed, Sir. Yet the things that we need to resolve, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are things like; when you go out and I know some people say and use this particular word, like the word that is used with respect to people saying “ vulagi ”. Sir, I was born here I understand, I understood what you said in the Business Committee Meeting, it may have been brought up in different context but the context in which is being used is actually insulting to us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, all I am going to say is, this is what our sons and daughters need to rely on. Otherwise, Sir, my other half is from Oneata, what are my children going to be called? The former Attorney-General’s children what are they going to be called? We should not be doing that to ourselves. We have a happy medium already here, Sir. With respect to the majority of the population that send us here to do things, yes sometimes we may not agree but most of the time the only people that are best at being Fijian are us. All of us, not some of us - we are the best at the world in doing many things, Sir. We are the best at the world now being flaunted around the world in many institutes as Fijians having the best way to resolve things, yet at home we need to setup a Truth and Reconciliation Commission? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to end by saying something in iTaukei, “ kevaka keimami sa vulagi me keimami qai lako tale i vei” where do we go? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, serving my third term in Parliament, this motion is perfect and is most suitable for Fiji today. The honourable Prime Minister is celebrating his birthday today and I am around the same vintage, so I have seen Fiji grow. We saw the battle during the Colonial days to decide and to agree on the way forward with our politicians in their time at 60s. Independence came in 1970, the brave new world - I was part of that, we were young, and I have seen Fiji grow from where we are today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say again, this motion is a must, and we must embrace the provisions and</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1823 this motion Mr. Speaker. When I read it, it captures the essence of what I believe should be done in Fiji today to strengthen our community, bring people together, unify us as one. I will read it out again: “The Parliament agrees for the establishment of a Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission by the Government to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling and confront fears in view of conflicting statements and utterances regarding motives behind the political upheavals so that closure and healing for Fiji is achieved and permanently put to rest this unfortunate and turbulent chapter of our independent history.” We need to do this. As the honourable Kiran has said today and I loved what she said, “this is a beautiful country”. We are a beautiful country, but we need to clean up a number of things to fully realise the potential of this country and enjoy the beauty that we know is there. This motion is presented with humility and the importance of humility is this - it extends more compassion and empathy to others. This presented with humility. You notice the tone from this side of Parliament, the tone that is driving, dictating the leadership in this country today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Our Prime Minister epitomises the humility and most importantly, Mr. Speaker, he does not hide anything. He has been very open, yes, he has apologised a number of times but here is a leader who hides nothing from his people. Of course, others can do the same for 2006. We know we celebrated for the last few days about the changes that we saw in this Parliament, the tabling of the Urgent Oral Question which I had shared with you. For eight years, I sat on the other side of Parliament, I remembered the day there was this landslide that almost buried Draubuta in my Constituency at Nadroga/Navosa. I wanted to raise an Urgent Oral Question and I was told that is the business of the Executive, the Legislature has no business asking what the Executive does. These were the principles of separation of powers that prevail at that time but today we know things have changed, the tone has changed. It is true parliamentary democracy, the Executive will not hide anything from the Legislature. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course yesterday, we withdrew a Bill that we believeD based on the presentation from the other side needed a bit more work. We argued for eight years over certain Bills, we knew they were not perfect but not once it have the humility to say “we withdraw it and bring it back”. This is a new tone in the country today and I would urge everyone to buy in, into this tone and do things with humility, accept and embrace the way we bring forward some very important issues that are important to our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see a lot of emotions today and the emotions confirm to me that we need this Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I remember in the case of the South African TRC – in one case a white policeman was called by the Commission and in the presence of his township, he was asked, “How did you treat these people?” Truthfully, he explained what he did to them, the manner he treated the black people in South Africa. The people could not help themselves and they cried openly, but at the end of all that weeping, they embraced each other because the truth came out. The black people could not believe that the white man who did that to them, would be truthful in a Commission like that. That is what Fiji needs. We know there is a lot of hurt in our country, so we need to bring that out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that it is very difficult to stand in the gap and pull our people together. You ask our colleagues who pulled together and set up the luvedra na Ratu, what they had to go through to bring that together. It was not easy, and it is still not easy today. Standing in the gap means it is still not easy, but we need to stand in the gap and pull the people in, and this is one way of standing in the gap. There are some concerns raised by my colleague, honourable Ravunawa, that there could be mistakes, that the motion is not properly worded. But, as enumerated by</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>1824 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 honourable Premila Kumar, many of the countries have done this and we will learn from them. Indeed, when we set this up in 2005 and 2006, the South Africans helped us set up what we wanted to do at that time, which unfortunately, did not see the light of day. Please, do not be fearful. It has been done all over the world and we will reach out to whoever, to help us set this up and make sure that it is done properly. It is this fear of opening up the old wounds, but it was on this side of Parliament that is sweeping things under the rug, and we know that you cannot do that. You have to bring it out in the open for all the wounds left unattended, will fester. It is better to cleanse those wounds and it is political maturity to take on that challenge and do it. That is what we are saying today, the political maturity to do this. I look at the case of Australia in terms of the natives of Australia. A member of my family is married to a native of Australia and I can relate, and I am very impressed with the way they have improved over the years. A week ago, honourable Kamikamica and I were part of the Fiji Business Council AGM in Sydney. As traditional in Australia today there is this. “Welcome to Country”, and it is normally by a native, who are the traditional custodians of the land, who greet you in whatever event you hold in Australia. This lady who gave us the welcome to the country, her name is Aunty Ding, and she has 81 great grandchildren. I say this because I just saw the strength in this woman, and knowing the natives back then some years ago, there is a sense of confidence within the community now in Australia. Indeed, my family who is married to a native of Australia, said that natives of Australia have made great strides over the years. There was a time when we were way ahead of them, but now they are equal to us in terms of education and other areas of human development. What happened in Australia, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the acknowledgment by the leadership back in the 1990s that they were not treating the natives well. It used to be harsh harsh but Paul Keating in the 1990s said, we know we did not do this, and that process of acknowledgement Mr. Speaker, Sir, has helped uplift the natives of Australia and of course we remember the apology by honourable Prime Minister Kevin Rudd over the Stolen Generation that all added up to strengthening the native Australians today and into what they are today. They are very powerful people Mr. Speaker, Sir, and what I am emphasising here is the acknowledgement, something needed to be acknowledged and they said about doing, improving the lot of the natives of Australia. What we need to have in Fiji today is also to acknowledge that there exists in our midst the sense of reservation, the concern that we are not being truthful to each other, that fear, we need to acknowledge that and we need to do something about it and we believe this is the way to do it. As I have said, standing in the gap is not easy, ask those who have tried and we need Mr. Speaker, Sir, to move forward. We need the sense of acknowledgement. We must all agree, we must all acknowledge this. You cannot hide your head in the sand or sweep it under the rug, we have to acknowledge this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have today in my Ministry is an unprecedented level of interest to invest in this country and just yesterday I was called during Parliament sitting to meet some people in the Government Chambers and they just said to me that there is something about this country. We feel a sense of goodwill in this country, there is something here. It is very unique compared to the other parts of the world where they go to and this is our strength Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to build confidence. We know there is still room to develop and being honest with each other, being truthful is the way forward for our country and I must share with you today the investors that we are seeing Mr. Speaker, Sir, are mostly the diaspora of our own people. Our own people over the last eight months with the new Coalition Government have come back in big numbers to invest in Fiji. This process will confirm to them that we are on the right path,</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1825 that yes there is now freedom in this country. There is no more fear, people can come back to where they were born. No one is going to be kept out of this country and we are going one step further to cleanse ourselves of all these fear that has held us hostage for a good many years. Yes, I agree with honourable Koya, our history goes back to the colonial days, the deed of cession hence the need to cleanse. We are not going to limit the dialogue to 1987, 2000, 2006 it is a whole process of listening to people and that is what will uplift the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge everyone to accept us. As I said we are not the only one, our neighbours, the Solomon Islanders did this and it worked for them and Fiji there is something that has been hanging over our head for quite some time and we need to cleanse ourselves and move away from being held hostage to old feelings that need to be cleansed. And if I may, Mr. Speaker, let me close with Psalms 133:1: “How good and pleasant it is when brothers live in unity”. Sir, that is what we are trying to accomplish here today. To live in unity, in truth and without fear hence the need to set-up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the speakers that have contributed to this motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir. Much has been said that shows us the need for the set-up of the Commission. Many of our honourable Members from the Opposition side has spoken about bringing out hurts, yet in Parliament they themselves have brought out the events of 1987 during the contribution over the past few months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can only give what we have. Our honourable Prime Minister has reflected on his actions, healed and has been working on making amends for decades. It started with his partnership with NFP Leader late Justice Jai Ram Reddy who was held at gun point during 1987. They shook hands, they forgave and tried to move the nation forward through deep conversations and processes to deliver the 1997 Constitution. During the consultation for development of 1997 Constitution, I think that would have been the first healing process where I saw submissions being made from all extremes. I have admired the leadership of NFP and the NFP leaders of our past who had the vision to be able to look beyond the pain to see the growth of the nation. I know honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Professor Biman Prasad was also affected by the events of 1987, he also chose to work on building peace. If you read the life of Ghandi or Nelson Mandela, people we all admire, we learn that path of peace and healing is much more difficult, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is much more difficult to work on and requires a strength of character that is not easy but I am humbled to serve in this Parliament with leaders who have chosen this difficult path. I admire the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership during that time and devastated when I realise the nation was not ready to receive the gift of healing and working together. I know our honourable Prime Minister was committed and kept working on peace building not only here but in the Pacific region, in particular Solomon Islands. More recently, Mr. Speaker, when I joined politics I have been privileged to be in forums where the honourable Prime Minister has spoken his heart. I have seen in his eyes and his voice a deep commitment to re-building the nation. I know he has been blamed for starting all the problems and he has taken the responsibility and wants to do everything possible to leave this country a better place. The question I often ask myself, why is one person taking the blame? When this must have been a collective work, there were many people involved in 1987 and could have stopped him as well. But he received support for his actions, why? For any plant to grow the ground has to be ready; (a) What were the reasons? (b) Why was the ground ready for this plant to take root?</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>1826 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 13 th Sept., 2023 (c) What were the root causes? Have we dealt with the root causes? Sir, maybe not so we kept seeing political upheavals over the years. Is it not time we study these roots to try and eliminate them Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Prime Minister, we can only give what we have, you have been a beacon of hope that you have taken the time to reflect, heal and are ready to help the nation heal by answering the questions. After taking leadership of this nation our honourable Prime Minister has reminded us regularly to lead with kindness, not to be revengeful, raise the bar for leadership and let love shine in all things we do. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has changed the tone of this nation. I have seen the honourable Prime Minister apologise many times and every time I feel very humbled and as a leader and elder, I wish he would not do that anymore and I hope through this process the need for that apology is no more as we will create a process to have everyone’s questions answered and heal the hurts. Mr. Speaker, we are all coloured by experiences from political upheavals, I was too after seeing 2000 and learning from that event made me want to understand the root causes and heal the relationships in this nation. I had witnessed evictions, met rape victims, crime against my people and I was feeling very pained on behalf of my people as I moved around most affected areas during the crisis of 2000. I was angry and blessed to joined the peace process and took the time to look at my stereotypes, to look at the fears of the people, learn the concerns of the people and realise if the communities are hurting. I am very blessed that having a deep desire to work healing of this nation I have been given the opportunity to raise this motion. I would like to raise the issue of vulagi that has been mentioned and has been all over the media and raised in this Parliament today, Mr. Speaker. I wonder those who have commented whether they have listened to the Prime Minister’s speech where he allegedly called us vulagi. When I listen to the Prime Minister’s speech, he seemed he was speaking about himself being a guest in that space, he did not call anyone else vulagi, he did not say Indo-Fijians, Melanesians or vulagi, he used the word for himself. We are wounded so we have taken that to hurt ourselves and create more divide instead of looking at the context in which it was spoken and that is what the Commission can do, heal us so that we can look at the context. I remember when we visited Bau to attend the late Roko Tui Bau's funeral with the Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui Dreketi she explained to me that she is a vulagi, a guest on the island and there is a traditional door a family we had to go to. They will announce our arrival to the Chief of the land, it is a normal tradition but maybe we have been wounded by the past. Being called vulagi in the past and we are still carrying the wound, the leaders have not healed keep amplifying the pain passing it to younger generation. When we are leaders, people hold on to our words thinking we must be telling the truth but some of the truth is coloured by our own experiences and pain. To address this to the people, leaders have to heal themselves first. From what I have learnt from Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in different parts of the world including Solomon Islands, I strongly believe that we could move ahead for healing of this nation. Create peace for generations to come as we keep narrating to younger generations our pain of the past. 60 percent of this nation was not here in 1987 as mentioned by honourable Koya but young generations tell a story of pain because that is how we related it to them during political campaigns. We must heal so we do not rob our next generation of the innocence, we give them the gift of love of different people in this land. For that we need humility to be able to tell the truth and be able to have the patience to listen to allow time and space to heal so no politician uses this painful events to further their political campaign as we have seen in the recent past. I thank all the leaders who have contributed and plead with all Members of this Parliament to bless this nation with healing and support the motion to agree to establish the Truth and Reconciliation</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Establishment of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission 1827 Commission. With genuine intentions and right spirit the Commission can deliver peace and healing because we have leaders committed to the process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you I wish to thank our Prime Minister I was hoping for his birthday we will have the gift of passing this motion and can sincerely say “happy birthday.” Because I have seen the emotions and the pain he has been carrying that he wants to work on healing this nation and pray that he has a healthy and long life to continue passing his wisdom and luck to this nation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may this nation grow with peace and prosperity with the leadership of our Prime Minister, with that I commend the motion to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast: - Ayes Noes - Not Voted - 28 23 4 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- If there is truth in that, honourable Koya, then I think you are really excited. (Laughter) Honourable Members, upon the agreement of both sides of Parliament, both Committee Reports on today’s and tomorrow’s Order Papers will be deferred for further debate at the November Sitting. The amended Order Paper for tomorrow will be circulated this evening. As such, honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. I thank you all for your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 8.23 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70</p></body>
