<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements</h4><p>under Standing Order 40, the: 1. Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection; 2. Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; and 3. Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports. Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes. After the Ministers, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. Violence Against Children in Fiji</p><h4>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin my Ministerial Statement, I wish to</h4><p>wish our honourable Prime Minister a very happy birthday today. (Acclamation) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members; I would like to start my Ministerial Statement with a verse from the Holy Bible, Psalm 127: 3 which says, and I quote: “Children are the gift from the Lord, and they are a reward from him”.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, I wish to make reference to a well-known quote: “Our Children are the foundation and future leaders of our country”. We must, at all costs, ensure that we, as a nation, strengthen our commitment to caring for and protecting our children. Each child in Fiji depends on us to make decisions that will guarantee they are safe and their rights are protected, to ensure they have a bright future to reach their full potential. Mr. Speaker, there is a sad reality in our country. Children are still subject to physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse and neglect. Mr. Speaker, we have been informed of the statistics of violence against women which is two in every three women in this country or 64 percent of women face some form of violence in their lifetime. However, Mr. Speaker, the statistics for children is far worse - four out of five children, that is 83 percent of our children are facing some form of abuse or violence. Mr. Speaker, the Child Welfare Act (CWA) database reported in 2022 a total of almost 2,000 cases. This was a 29 percent increase from 2021, which was 1,500 cases reported. According to the statistics for 2022: • • • • • • child victims were girls - 54 percent; child neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse - 68 percent; child victims were below the age of 12 - 58 percent; child victims were below the age of 1 - 3.7 percent; and perpetrators are known to the victims - 80 percent; and immediate family members - 60 percent. For this year alone, a total of almost a thousand cases have been reported between the months of January to July. In the same period last year, it was a total of 1,200 cases. This was a decrease compared to last year. However, cases are still being reported from these months and can increase. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the 956 cases reported this year: • • • • 54 percent of the victims were girls; 75 percent of the cases are of neglect, physical abuse, behavioural and sexual abuse; 4 percent of the victims are below the age of one; 75 percent of the perpetrators are known to the victims. Out of the 75 percent, 70 percent are immediate family members, so these numbers are on the rise. Mr. Speaker, the Government of the day recognises the importance of establishing a dedicated Department for Children, to effectively address increasing incidents of social issues involving our children. As you all know, we have allocated a budget to the establishment of the Department for Children of $100,000 initially which will see to having the Director for Children, Principal Officer and another Officer, as I had mentioned, to start it off. At this juncture, I wish to inform the Parliament that the Ministry is in the process of recruiting the Director and other key positions. Of course, Government continues the funding of $200,000 for Child Protection; $2,000 for the Child Helpline; $10,000 for the development of Childcare Policy and Programme; $230,000 for grants to voluntary oganisations managing our children’s homes and Empower Pacific; $100,000 for the State Home for Girls; and $692,000 for the Boys Centre or juveniles.</p><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1763 Mr. Speaker, this time, I would like to explain a little bit about the frangipani lapel pins which were distributed earlier this week, and I thank all honourable Members for wearing them today. Allow me to share the story of the frangipani with you my colleagues and of course to the members of the public and those who are watching. The frangipani is a flower that grows from the plumeria temple tree. For the tree to flower, it strongly depends on the environment in which it grows. In order for the frangipani to manifest its soft and enriching qualities, the roots of the tree must be strong. When a frangipani is fully developed, it consists of five petals. A frangipani can come in diverse range of colour combination and exudes a beautiful, sweet fragrance. The petals of the flowers are delicate, pure looking and need proper care and attention in order to sustain its features. The nature of the frangipani exemplifies the natural essence of a child. The flower is a symbol of a child and the roots from which the flower grows symbolises families, communities, schools, our culture, our religion. These roots, when strong enough, will help the child grow and develop the five petals. These five petals symbolise the core values of love, trust, protection, care and respect. In order to help children grow, their roots must work together by guiding them, speaking up and being their voices. Families and communities must spend time with their children and focus on enriching their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. Every frangipani, like a child, is unique. For each flower to bloom and for each child to flourish it requires nurturing, care and love. We carry the symbol of the frangipani with us to remind ourselves of the potential of every child. Child Protection is all of our responsibility, not just the Government and we must ensure that every child feels loved, protected, respected, cared for and trusted in order for them to reach their full potential. Mr. Speaker, last month, a group called the Concerned Citizens of Fiji, led by Pastor Joe Yaya, approached me and sought for us to host the screening of the highly anticipated movie called “Sounds of Freedom”. This film sends a very powerful call to action and exposes the global activity on this legal and severe form of child sexual abuse which includes kidnapping and transferring of children for the purposes of forced labour and exploitation for child sex trafficking. Mr. Speaker, I accepted this proposal, and it links well with the Ministry’s mandated role in the care and protection of children, through creating awareness. If any Member of this Parliament has not seen this movie, I do implore you to, please, watch, it is based on a true story of trafficking of children. During the screening on 24 th August, we invited Members of Parliament, representatives from across Government agencies, Foreign Missions, international governmental organisations, Civil Society Organisations, faith-based organisations, media partners and also members of the public, to attend. Mr. Speaker, the main actor (Jim Caviezel) shares at the end of the movie, his own excerpt of why he supports the movie and why we should create awareness on child trafficking. He said that we need to be aware that even though human trafficking may not be visible in our country, it is happening. The line of the movie that I wish to share here in Parliament is that, God’s children are not for sale. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry, in partnership with UNICEF, the University of the South Pacific (USP), Fiji National University (FNU) and MFAT (New Zealand), is launching the Violence against Children in Fiji Report at the end of this month on 26 th September, to which we will all be invited as</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Members of Parliament, at 5.00 p.m. at the University of the South Pacific. Our Ministry commissioned this Report at USP and FNU to conduct this joint research with a specific focus on children in the home setting. As I had mentioned, this month on 26 th September, we will be launching this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite previous efforts, we see high numbers of violations continuing, including child rape and neglect. Levels of sexual violence are very high against teenage girl children, but do include cases down to infants under five years of age, and these are some of the findings in this Report. Majority of the perpetrators are family members. The Report provides an indication of geographical hotspots by type of violation. This study represents a significant and timely step forward in the protection of children in Fiji. Evidence-based reports provide a solid footing to set targets connected without outcomes for children, including child friendly services and reduced rates of children in institutional care. There are clear recommendations in this Report on the need for a whole of Government and whole of society approach and improve coordination across our key Ministries. Importantly, the Report also provides material to inform and focus prevention efforts whether with parents, communities, religious leaders or with children themselves which, going forward, needs to include boys. Mr. Speaker, lastly on 19 th November, the Ministry will be commemorating the International Day for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect and the theme for this year is, “Every Child is one caring adult away from being a success story - it starts with us”. The theme emphasises the importance of fulfilling our responsibility as a parent or guardian. This is also extended to our communities, our places of worship and many public spaces in which a child is in. No matter what your role is, child protection is everyone’s responsibility. Mr. Speaker, child abuse in all its forms exists in Fiji and we have heard the recent statistics and trends - very worrying trends. We, as a Ministry, will continue to work with our stakeholders to increase awareness on child abuse and neglect. To this end, I would like to begin with our esteemed colleagues in Parliament and hopefully, in time to come, we will organise with Parliament to have an informational session on this very topic to raise awareness on child welfare issues, including the relevant laws and international laws, which the Fiji Government has ratified to address child abuse and strengthen the rights of a child. We believe that as Members of Parliament, we are the public figures in our communities and we can play a vital role in supporting the Ministry to being champions for children or child advocates. Once again, I thank you for donning the frangipani pins to raise awareness about caring for our children. I would conclude by reminding us of the theme for this year “Every Child is one caring adult away from being a success story - it starts with us”. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. I now call upon the Leader of Opposition or his designate to responds. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, I would like to echo the birthday well wishes from Members of Parliament: Happy birthday, Sir.</p><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1765 Honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members; I think most of us in this Parliament are parents and grandparents and some may be great grandparents. Congratulations, honourable Prime Minister, for being a great grandparent. Anything to do with children is always something that is very important for us. First of all, I would like to thank the Ministry and the honourable Minister for continuing this focus on children. I think all Governments in the past have held children to be dear, as you have mentioned. They are a gift from God and it is our job to make sure that they flourish in an environment where they are not abused, they are not subject to neglect and they can realise the full potential of their being created because we believe that when every child is created, there is a future that is there for that particular child. That future, as has been explained by the honourable Minister in the ideology behind the petals of the bua (frangipani), the bua (frangipani) is named after Bua, the vanua of the yalomatua. I think it is a reflection that if you have yalomatua, you will make sure that you look after the children that we have because the petals have been explained. Bua and Verata, I do not know which one comes first. (Laughter) Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that we have read with great trepidation and horror some of the stories that have been coming out lately about the extent of violence against children. It is not just sexual violence, it is also a lot of the psychological violence. I think one of the great things that we have been able to do in this country - our traditional notions about how we think about children have evolved. I remember when I was a child, children used to sit or eat later on when we sat down to eat. Today, we are beginning to see these values beginning to change. If I read about the whole history of how children were treated in the past, they were treated as not very important at all. Over time, it has evolved, but I think whilst we that live today, a lot of their abuses are more subtle. They are more ingrained into some of the things that we do, so it is incumbent upon us to take this action. Having this frangipani and lapel pins, I have heard my children and grandchildren ask me what it stands for? So, I told them it is something to do with violence against children and I am hoping and looking forward to grip all the plans that you have in place and the call for all stakeholders to become involved is something that we will all play our part. From our part in this Parliament, we will make sure that we do that because the children, as we say, are gifts from God to us. Some of the statistics that the Minister has talked about here are quite shocking. I find it quite shocking - 75 percent of the abuse was known, sexual perpetrators of people are known by the child, and 70 percent from family members. I think that tells us that the solution is not going to be handled by laws, it will need a multi-faceted approach from all of us. We, on this side of Parliament, commit to taking this message and we hope to be there at the launch of that Report on Violence Against Children in Fiji and the International Day Against Child Abuse and Neglect. We look forward to the Government to be able to take the next step with the report coming out and the development to the programmes, the plans, the policies, the outputs and the targets to make sure that we, in our time, in leading this country here that we can reverse this trap that we are seeing. It keeps on going up. I think one of the statistics that the honourable Minister talked about was the 29 percent increase in case of child abuse. Sometimes people say that some of these increases are because</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 people are now reporting more of the things that were happening in the past. I hope it is just that, but it could be that there is also an increase in the propensity of abuse happening. Mr. Speaker Sir, from our side, we fully appreciate the initiatives for the frangipani badge and also the development to the Report on Violence Against Children in Fiji. We look forward to the programmes and we call upon all stakeholders in this country - the Churches, communities and all of us, to join hands and to make sure that we join hands in attacking this curse so that during our time, this increase in child abuse reverses and begins to go down. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members just to pause for a minute and think of this very important subject that we have heard from the honourable Minister for Women and the input provided by the designate for the Leader of the Opposition, all he has asked is, we all have a vested interest in this because they are our future, they are our children. But if this statement is just going to be made and then passed through without any collective effort from us, or from you honourable Members, then the issue will still be an ongoing one, without any hopeful decision to address the very source of the problem and that is from the family, from the mataqali, et cetera. All I just want to raise is, what has happened to the institution that used to be there in Nasinu - Nasinu Approved School. If the army has taken over, why can they not join the Army? You remember for the British Armed Forces who want to join, they are not worried about your age or your education level. They put an advertisement out in the streets, “We will educate you, we will school you”. All you need to do is join the army. There are different cadre of age groups that join the armed forces because they are joining the Disciplined Forces, what we are trying to do is keep them off the streets. I just said the other day that I almost ran into some, they were crossing the street at Nabukalou to go below the bridge. That is where they spend most of their evenings. They are our people. I sincerely ask both sides of Parliament to, please, if we could play a much more active role on this, rather than the initiative on the yellow bua, where the bua comes from, where the name comes from. It is good, but does it address the issue or is that just another lapel pin on your jacket there? I like the yellow ribbon concept, they got the vanua involved, they got the people involved, yet we still have people frequently in the prisons every now and again. They get free food, free medical supplies, free medical check-up when in prison, even though the conviction is added to your history. That is all that I want to raise as the matter of concern because every now and again, we will get this kind of statements, but what have we done to address the issue? Honourable Members, I leave that to you and plead with you that we need to take a collective position on this. Let us try and address the issue and hammer the head on the nail right on the head instead of sideways or whatever. Livestock Breeding Programme for Farmers in Fiji HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a statement on the Livestock Breeding Programme for farmers in Fiji. The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; one of the core roles of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is to ensure the supply of high quality livestock breed and breeding stock to farmers with the view to improve the quality of genetics on their farms. The Ministry of Agriculture is committed to breeding and distributing high performing breeds of sheep, goats and cattle to farmers in Fiji. Apart from supplying quality livestock genetics, the</p><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1767 Ministry is also committed to assisting farmers with technical support and capacity building to ensure the sustainability of the breeding programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Livestock Nucleus are reared on eight livestock Government Research Stations in Fiji, and these are: 1. Koronivia Research Station; 2. Sigatoka Research Station; 3. Wairara Bull Station; 4. Dobuilevu Bull Station; 5. Nawaicoba Sheep Station; 6. Seaqaqa Sheep Station; 7. Batiri Sheep Station; and 8. Mua Sheep Station in Taveuni. Note that the stations are geographically spread out due to these programmes being national programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the various livestock species are bred on Government Research Stations using bio-technology interventions such as embryo transfer, artificial insemination and controlled natural mating. The livestock progenies produced from the breeding programmes are carefully selected based on good genetic attributes which are then sold to farmers with the aim of improving genetics of livestock on their farms. The breeds on the Government Research Stations are assessed and evaluated on their adaptability to local conditions and resilience to impacts of climate change and disease as well as on production levels before they are released to farmers for breeding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Nucleus Stock for different livestock breeds are adequately reared on the Government Stations where execution of the best animal welfare and good farm management practices are conducted to produce quality livestock progenies. Livestock rearing, breeding, nutrition, health and husbandry practices are professionally carried out by the Ministry to ensure quality livestock are produced and supplied to farmers. Note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that good genetics goes with good feed if we want livestock products of high quality. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the existing livestock breeding plans, the Ministry intends to sell the improve livestock breeds to farms in the form of live animals and this programme is further supported through artificial insemination and control making on those farms. In the last financial year, the Ministry has supplied six Senepol, five Brown Swiss and three F1 Senepol crossed with local breeds of cattle to selected farms. Sir, 68 improved breed of sheep were supplied from the Nawaicoba Research Station and 82 were supplied from Seaqaqa Research Station to selected farms. Also, 26 improved breed of goats were also supplied from the Sigatoka Research Station to selected farms for breeding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Livestock Breeding Programme for the current financial year, the Ministry anticipates selling 80 bulls of improved breeds to selected farms in Fiji. Let me inform this august Parliament, Mr. Speaker Sir, we currently have four Senepol bulls that weigh over one tonne in the Sigatoka Research Sation, the heaviest being 1.4 tonne. I must give credit to the current Leader of the Opposition because when he was our Minister, we had embarked on this very ambitious programme where we had difficulty in convincing the Ministry of Economy to give us money for this Programme. But eventually, the Minister through his intervention, managed to get the funds for</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 this Programme and I was the unfortunate officer sent to Australia to accompany the embryos back to Fiji. (Laughter) The Ministry’s Breed Improvement Support Programme through the provision of artificial insemination services will be targeted at beef and dairy farms in the current financial year. The Ministry intends to produce 2,000 semen straws locally from the improved cattle breeds in the Sigatoka Research Station which is intended to be inseminated in cows on selected farms in Fiji. To support the pool of locally harvested semen, the Ministry will also be importing 160 dairy that is Jersey, Friesian and Kiwi Cross genetics and 160 beef, that is, Hereford genetics of frozen semen straws from New Zealand to further improve the genetics on our farms in Fiji. For sheep, Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry anticipates to supply 400 breeding stock (70 percent male and 30 percent female) to potential farms in Fiji. For goats, the Ministry intends to supply 100 breeding stock (80 percent male and 20 percent female) to potential farms in Fiji. Mr. Speaker Sir, the current improved breeds that exist at our Research Stations are as follows: • • • • For dairy cattle, we have the Kiwi Cross, Brown Swiss and Crossbred (F1) between Brown Swiss and the Kiwi Cross breed. For beef cattle, we have the Senepol, we have the Drought Master and we have the Wagyu. For those of you who may not know, ‘Wagyu’ is the most expensive beef in the world and it goes for US$250 per kilogramme, but it is here in Fiji through embryo transfer. We have F1 Cross from Senepol crossed with the local breed, and the local cattle. For sheep, we have the Fiji Fantastic breed which is the locally produced breed, we have the Dorper breed, we have the F1 from Fiji Fantastic crossed with Dorper and the F2 from the F1 crossed with Dorper. For goats, we have the Anglo Nubian, we have the imported Boer, we have F1, that is the Anglo Nubian crossed with the Boer, and we have F2 which is F1 crossed with Boer, we have the imported Anglo Nubian, and we have the imported Saanen and Toggenburg, which are both dairy goat breed and these are crossed with the local goats. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key criteria that are set out by the Ministry for farms to receive improved breeds of livestock are as follows: • • • Farms need to be free from disease; Farms need to have the required number of female livestock for breeding; and Farms need to have sufficient land for expansion and to cater for the increase in livestock numbers. The Ministry is promoting commercial agriculture as one of its priorities under its Strategic Development Plan, and packages for assistance to farmers for farm development have been made available online to support this sector and assistance such as fencing, pasture improvement and infrastructure development on the farm.</p><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1769 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the livestock breeding activities under the Ministry are supported through capital programmes in this financial year and funds allocated are as follows: • • • • Beef breeding - $1 million; Livestock rehabilitation (cattle) - $400,000; Sheep Breeding - $400,000; and Goat breeding - $215,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to have adequate number of improved breeds of livestock in Fiji, the Ministry has made a commitment to the following: • • • • • Upgrade Government owned nucleus stock through embryo transfer technology in cattle and artificial insemination in sheep and goat. Operationalise the cattle breeding centre at Sigatoka Research Station to supply cattle with improved genetics in the form of semen through straws. Increase the number of breeding stock on Government stations so that adequate improved breeds of livestock are available for distribution to farmers when needed. Improve nutrition through pasture development and supplementary feed formulation. Control and eradicate endemic disease in livestock in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving the genetic makeup of livestock breeds in Fiji remains a high priority for the Ministry of Agriculture. With improved breeds, better husbandry management and disease control, we aim to increase the volume of local meat and the whole milk production and aim to reduce our import bill for those products. The Ministry will continue with its breeding programmes on research stations and collaborate with its partners on adaptive research, and better coordinate with stakeholders and farmers on the ground with the aim to grow the livestock sector in Fiji. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just be very brief, but let me again convey, on behalf of the Members of the Opposition, our very best wishes to the honourable Prime Minister on his birthday. As I have stated, I do not have much to add, but we, as Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, are very much looking forward to our field visit, subject to your approval in the next two weeks so that we can see the programmes and the new breeds. The honourable Minister always says that he is the unfortunate one to go and bring the embryos because of two reasons, firstly, it coincided with the well renowned Israeli Agriculture Show. He said that he was victimised in that decision because he wanted to go to the Holy Land. Secondly, I always say as a joke to him that because he accompanied the embryos, there was no live animal that was brought into Fiji, so he is the father of the bulls. MR. SPEAKER.- I was a bit worried about that. (Laughter) So if you see the animals, Sir, I think it will make a lot of sense too. (Laughter)</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 But, on a serious note, again, transforming the agriculture sector takes time, particularly research. I think we are at this juncture where we can build on the potentials and the opportunities that are here. Again, huge potentials and all that, I would plead to Government is the support that will be needed, particularly in terms of infrastructure because I know with embryos, one of the initial difficulties was the storage and the need for us to have all the proper gadgets and technology involved. May I acknowledge, Mr. Simon Walton, the main man behind the embryo transfer. What is needed is the support to the honourable Minister and, of course, the Assistant Minister. as well. I would just like to encourage all those with land, including your good self, Sir, because there is a lot of potential. All landowners in Fiji, freehold landowners and iTaukei landowners because we have the breed in here but I think in the transitioning, I know that currently they are already in discussions with the Turaga na Ka Levu and some others, they are approaching a few because as we all know, we need to revive Yalavou, Yaqara and, of course, Tilivalevu. I know that agriculture is looking for land in which they can expand this programme and, again, to all the stakeholders particularly the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, iTLTB and Ministry of Lands, if they have some land deposited into the Land Bank, a huge opportunity is in here. I have talked about the necessary support, I know that the honourable Minister has talked about the nutrition aspect because he spoke about the one tonne plus weight that the bulls have gained but it took them about five years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In the most ideal condition, these breeds can hit that weight at around three and half years and that is why the nutrition aspect is so important and probably something that the Government needs to consider seriously as well in supporting the honourable Minister to achieve his aims. Again, genetics are here, we just need to provide the environment for the expansion because as the honourable Minister has stated very clearly, the challenge for us right now is the shift from research into commercial production so that we can reduce our import levels and, of course, increase our export levels. The honourable Minister did talk about, not only cattle but the dairy cows as well. I am thankful for the new initiative, again, for further cross breeding but we were fortunate to have been able to have the Brown Swiss as the honourable Minister has already alluded to. I am told in some of my conversations with Ministry of Agriculture staff that right now, those cows are hitting almost 20 litres, our dairy cows normally hit 5 litres to 10 litres at their best. Again, nutrition is important. I am told that in the second round of their lactation, they are now reaching 20 litres and above. So, huge potentials, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have nothing further to add but to wish the honourable Minister all the very best in this programme. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition for those scientific comments, especially with the massive weight of the bulls and the scientific approach that you now use in getting embryos and whatever you stated there to be inseminated, and that is very educational. Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.35 a.m.</p><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1771 The Parliament resumed at 11.17 a.m. 2023 International Youth Day Celebration HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to address this august House by providing an update of this year’s International Youth Day Celebration and the impact it created. Before I do that, on behalf of our youth in Fiji and all the sportspeople and sporting bodies, we wish to congratulate the honourable Prime Minister on his 75 th birthday and we wish him a long life. I further we wish to congratulate our Fiji Water Flying Fijians for the remarkable game they played against Wales. We wish them well in the next game against the Australian Wallabies. International Youth Day is observed annually the world over on 12 th August. It is meant as an opportunity for Government and others to draw attention to youth issues worldwide. This year, the event was held in four different locations around Fiji namely; Western, Northern, Central and Eastern, spanning from 3 rd August to 25 th August, 2023. Mr. Speaker, the 2023 International Youth Day was, undoubtedly, a remarkable event that highlighted the essential theme of “Green Skills for Youth Towards a Sustainable World”. In this age of pressing environmental challenges, it is vital for us to empower our young population with the necessary skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future. The Ministry of Youth and Sports recognised this urgency and orchestrated a celebration that fostered awareness, education and employment opportunities for our youth. Mr. Speaker, we have a very young population, current figures indicate that up to 70 percent of our population is youth under 40. This is significant and indicates the challenges we face as a country regarding full employment to ensure our economy continues to grow. A drastic drop in employment post-COVID-19 with the country recovering, and the recent influx of migration of workers overseas has had many negative implications not only on the economy but on the lives of many young people in the country. Mr. Speaker, with unemployment amongst youth, comes a whole host of socio-economic issues such mental health problems, domestic and gender violence, alcohol and drug use and crime. Additionally, being unemployed is associated with increased risk of death by suicide and this negatively affects physical well-being of youth, hinders skills development, causes youth homelessness, increased population of street kids and increased poverty, especially in urban and peri urban communities. It is against this backdrop that the Ministry launched a “Youth Career Fair” as part of the International Youth Day Celebration. The Youth Career Fair aimed to address the high youth unemployment rate in Fiji by focusing on eco-friendly industries, also filling the skills gap and available local job opportunities, hence creating a platform for local employers and environmentally conscious job-seeking youth to connect. Mr. Speaker, the International Youth Day celebration embarked on the following key expected outcomes: Increased (Green) Employment Opportunities; Enhanced Eco-Literacy Employability; Strengthened Green Collaborations; and 1. 2. 3. 4. Heightened public awareness regarding the importance of green skills, investing in the local workforce, ensuring that employers forge partnerships to address youth unemployment collectively and creating a sustainable future for Fiji.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, International Youth Day celebrations witnessed a good response with 1,240 youth attending the two-day celebration held at the Fiji National University, Nasinu Campus. Sir, 446 youth attending the celebration held at Labasa Civic Centre, 996 youth attending the celebration held at Nadi Civic Centre and 308 attended a programme held in Kadavu. A total of 2,990 youth were registered during International Youth Day that was celebrated across all four divisions. Various workshops and interactive sessions were organised to facilitate learning and knowledge exchange. Experts and professionals from different domains of sustainability delivered informative talks to inspire and motivate the young generation to be agents of change in our society. The events featured informative exhibitions, educational programmes that engaged our youth in understanding the significance of green skills. It was indeed heartening to witness the enthusiasm and passion as they actively participated in discussions and practical sessions. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Youth and Sports ensured that the celebrations provided holistic experience for our youth. The collaboration with various stakeholders and organisations working in sustainability played a pivotal role in the success of the event. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the presence of the compliance industry such as the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (FRCS), Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), Ministry of Justice through Birth, Death and Marriage and banking sectors provided the enabling environment and a one-stop shop for the youth to take advantage during the Youth Career Fair. Mr. Speaker, the impact of the programme was realised almost instantly as some youth were interviewed and absorb directly into the workforce. A total of 83 recruitments was done during the International Youth Day 2023 celebration. As of this week, 600 youth are currently training on the job prior to full employment. With discussions we are regularly having with stakeholders, we expect to see an increase in recruitment numbers for those youth who had attended the Career Fair in the coming weeks as employers commence their respective recruitment formalities. Mr. Speaker, to ensure success in our venture towards effective youth development, firstly, we need to foster partnerships with local and international organisations, youth-led initiatives and community stakeholders to create a broader and more inclusive platform for youth engagement. Collaboration enabled us to tap into diverse resources, expertise and networks, amplifying the impact of the International Youth Day. Mr. Speaker, we need to address critical global challenges such as climate change, poverty, youth unemployment, inequality, education and health innovatively with our young people. Encourage them to contribute their innovative ideas and solutions towards achieving these goals, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. We need to expend educational opportunities and continually provide platforms for sharing best practices in education, exploring new pedagogical approaches and leveraging technology to enhance learning outcomes. Speaking of youth unemployment, there is a need to strengthen Youth Entrepreneurship by empowering young entrepreneurs through creating an enabling environment that supports youth-led businesses and start-ups, facilitate access to finance, mentorship programmes and business development services, enabling young people to turn their innovative ideas into sustainable enterprises. Mr. Speaker, as a way forward, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has set up a roadmap to have such similar events like the Youth Career Fair on a quarterly basis - to quickly address the need of the industry on human capital and to strengthen youth development agenda aligned to the SDG and the National Development Plan.</p><p>13 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1773 Secondly, the Ministry will continuously engage with employers and other line Ministries in continuing to drive partnership/closer collaboration in addressing the current issues of increasing unemployment for our young people, addressing skills gaps that is increasing due to the number of people heading offshore for job opportunities. Thirdly, the Ministry will seek for an increased budget allocation to support these programmes to ensure effective implementation and sustainability. Furthermore, the Ministry will establish a targeted approach towards implementing Youth Empowerment and Skills Training by coordinating with employers to ascertain skills needed and organised trainings to meet the demands of the job market. Moreover, the Ministry will setup a database to store information of all youth registered through the Youth Career Fair including their CVs to ensure ease of reference when dealing with employers and employment opportunities available for our youth. Mr. Speaker, the dedication and hard work put into organising this year’s International Youth Day celebrations are commendable and I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the media industry especially the CEO of Fijian Broadcasting Corporation and his team, UNFPA for its continuous support towards youth development, stakeholders, line ministries and our dedicated staff in the Ministry for their unwavering commitment. Our special gratitude to the honourable Sashi Kiran for her support. As we look ahead to the future of the International Youth Day and Youth Career Fair in Fiji, it is crucial that we build upon the success of this year’s event and continue to prioritise the empowerment and development of our youth. Mr. Speaker, together we can create a world where every young person has the opportunity to thrive where their dreams and aspirations are realised and where their contributions are valued. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of economic opportunities has led to extreme poverty within our communities. The lack of economic opportunities has also led our youth to illegal activities, like growing marijuana in remote areas and others, as source of income. It is the lack of economic opportunities that has also led more youth to loiter around our urban centres and live on the streets. However, by aligning the event with the theme of “Green Skills for Youth Towards a Sustainable World” and launching a Youth Career Fair, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has taken a significant step towards empowering our young people to champion environmental sustainability and bridge the gap of the current employment need with different employment sectors and invest on our young people. We are very confident that the knowledge and skills gained by our young generation during these celebrations will shape a brighter and greener future for Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and esteemed Members of Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, for their response. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Ni sa bula vinaka, Mr. Speaker. This is a subject that we should all be passionate about - our young people. Our future, the future of Fiji, are in the hands of our young.</p><h4>I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and also for the</h4><p>successful conduct of that international event.</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>13 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker Sir, this is a subject, as I have said earlier, that we should be passionate about - all of us who are in this august Parliament. Like the first Ministerial Statement on our young, this is something similar to that. If you are not able to look after them when they are young at that early age, how can we ensure that the future of Fiji will be a peaceful one, or a prosperous one and a stable one? A few days ago, we gathered and shouted for our gladiators in France, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I believe it is also in that same voice, that same passion and that same commitment, that we should be able to do that this morning, on this day, and shout out to our young, telling them and assuring them, that we are committed to their future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have three key questions this morning that I wish to pose, on behalf of this side of Parliament. The fourth one is really an initiative initiated globally and I believe it resonates with the efforts and the attempts by us all, especially the Government, in directing a pathway for our future generation. The questions are: 3. 1. Are we prepared to advocate strongly on our youth and their future? How do we do that? 2. Can we give them that space that they can live, enjoy and know that they are supported fully by us - the communities in the village, urban, rural and at home? Can we keep them on track? Last few days, Mr. Speaker Sir, you have been talking about the Yellow Ribbon programme. In the last few days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been talking about the Yellow Ribbon Programme. The Yellow Ribbon Programme is about bringing them back on track for those who have gone off track. Can we keep them on track? Our Churches, our Vanua, our community, mums and dads, can we keep them on track? So that this Report that you have tabled this morning in this august Parliament becomes a reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can we assure them of our support and our prayers? 4. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have policies, we have a clear direction on where we want to take our youth and prepare them for the future of our nation. Those four questions that I have posed in this august Parliament are important to us all this morning. We advocate, we give them the space, we keep them on track, we assure them of our support and above all, we pray for them. This side of the Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, fully supports and endorses the Report that has been tabled this morning and we have the assurance on anything and everything to do with the youth, we support it, for therein lies the future of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- On the next Agenda item which is Questions, I have made some decisions on the first Oral Question. The author, honourable Bala, is not in Parliament and as such, I have allowed honourable Bia to raise this question on his behalf.</p></body>
