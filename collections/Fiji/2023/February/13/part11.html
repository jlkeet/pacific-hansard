<div><span>I take this opportunity to welcome honourable Members in today’s sitting and especially for

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to speeches, you have on your tables the bell timings, detailing the times for the 
<br/>first bell and then the final bell. Please, kindly take note of these timings so that you do not exceed 
<br/>your allocated time.  According to Standing Orders 64 and 68, each Member may speak up to 20

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resolution - Business Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, during the Business Committee meeting on Friday, 27</span><span>th </span><span>January, 2023, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Business Committee unanimously agreed to the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament may sit beyond 4.30 p.m. from Monday to Thursday and beyond 12.30 
<br/>p.m on Friday.  
<br/>Lunch breaks to be limited to one hour only.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  to  ensure  that  all  55  honourable  Members  have  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  His 
<br/>Excellency’s Address and also that Parliament can successfully deliberate on the items listed on the 
<br/>Order Papers for the week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reinstatement of Parliamentary Business 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the Business Committee had also unanimously agreed that all pending 
<br/>parliamentary  business  from  the  last  term  of  Parliament  will  be  reinstated  so  that  the  Standing 
<br/>Committees  can  continue  where  the  last  Parliament  left  off.    For  the  information  of  honourable 
<br/>Members,  there  are  68  Annual  Reports,  one  Treaty  and  21  Committee  Reports  pending  with 
<br/>respective Standing Committees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, take note that the reinstatement does not apply to the lapsed 
<br/>Bills.  Standing Order 97(2) clearly provides that lapsed Bills cannot be restored to the Order Paper 
<br/>in a new term of Parliament.
