<div><span>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Speaker  of  Parliament,  honourable  Acting  Chief  Justice  and  honourable 
<br/>Members  of  the  Judiciary,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  
<br/>honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  Your  Excellencies,  High  Commissioners,  Ambassadors  and 
<br/>Members of the Diplomatic Corps, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen - </span><span>mia’u sa bula si’a</span><span>
<br/></span><span>and a very good morning to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, allow me to acknowledge and greet our people and friends joining us this morning via 
<br/>television, livestreaming on the Parliament website and </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page or on the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> App or radio.  
<br/>I thank you all for your keen interest in viewing the State Opening of Parliament.   It  is  a  privilege 
<br/>and great pleasure for me this morning to open the 2023-2024 Session of our Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Speaker and honourable Members of Parliament, since November 2021 when I 
<br/>last addressed this august Parliament, our nation was at the tail-end of efforts to address the global 
<br/></span><span>pandemic, natural disasters and a period of uncertainty, distress and loss that gripped our nation.  The 
<br/></span><span>past three years have, indeed, been a challenge for us all.  As always, we have risen to the challenges 
<br/>and demonstrated our resilience as a nation and one people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we grapple with the ongoing and emerging challenges, I urged this august Parliament to 
<br/>embody  the  collective  spirit  of  resilience  and  resolve  of  our  people.  This  will  bring  hope  of  a 
<br/>promising future for our citizens of our beloved nation which we all call home.  Now, more than 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ever,  we  must  be  united  as  one  nation  and  strengthen  our  resolve  to  work  together  to  meet  our 
<br/>collective challenges.  We must continue to look after each other, especially those less fortunate and 
<br/>the most vulnerable members of our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last December, our nation went to the polls.  Our people cast their votes, exercising their 
<br/>civic  duty  and  constitutional  right  to  choose  their  government.  Unfortunately,  the  low  turnout  of 
<br/>voters was discouraging.  I hope more eligible voters will ensure that they are properly registered and 
<br/>make time to vote.  This will ensure our voices are heard by voting in the next general elections in 
<br/>2026.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the result was announced, a new Coalition Government has been sworn in and today, 
<br/>we gather to begin our work in earnest with the opening of this Parliament Session.  At this juncture, 
<br/>I am grateful to note that the change in Government has taken place peacefully and swiftly, and the 
<br/>new administration has commenced its work with the mandate of the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must acknowledge the contribution and the achievements of the previous  Government in 
<br/>steering the nation in the past 16 years.  On the same note, we congratulate the People’s Coalition 
<br/>Government - you now have the responsibility of leading our nation in the next four years. It is my 
<br/>privilege and duty this morning as your President to announce the policies, intentions and some of 
<br/>the proposed legislation of the People’s Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now moving into an era of uncertainty and rapid change due to the current geopolitical 
<br/>environment caused by the war in Ukraine and the US-China tensions which has very much affected 
<br/>global trade. As a small island State, the impact of such events will be much greater on Fiji and her 
<br/>people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion and further improve 
<br/>and strengthen our economy through sustainable growth with the ultimate objective of improving the 
<br/>lives of all the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There must be clear focus on the rule of law and democratic processes including transparency, 
<br/>accountability,  respect  for  human  rights  and  freedoms,  and  listening  to  the  views  of  the  people 
<br/>through genuine consultation.  The views of all members of our communities must be heard and I 
<br/>urge the People’s Coalition Government to ensure all initiatives and draft legislation must undergo 
<br/>thorough  consultation  process  for  better  outcomes,  to  ensure  inclusiveness  and  foster  greater 
<br/>ownership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  must  ensure  that  draft  laws  are  deliberated  in  consultation  with  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders particularly through the standing committee process.  Petitions must be accommodated 
<br/>so that the voice of the people is heard in Parliament when they seek solutions to issues that are of 
<br/>concern to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government must continue to adhere to the constitutional doctrine of the separation of 
<br/>powers as a cornerstone of our democracy and the necessity for public servants to perform their duties 
<br/>independently.    Within  the  Civil  Service,  there  will  be  more  human  resource  and  institutional 
<br/></span><span>capacity building to improve the service delivery to ordinary people and for civil servants to have a 
<br/></span><span>clear career path.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Public  Service  Commission  will  be  given  greater  powers  within  the  existing 
<br/>constitutional framework as a central coordinating agency on all human resource matters within the 
<br/>Public Service.  Operating framework and guidelines across the Service will foster more collegiality 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  coordination  for  greater  efficiency  and  productivity.    Decisions  taken  by  Cabinet  will  be 
<br/>announced so that the people of Fiji are well informed of actions taken by the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister announced earlier this week that the resolution of Cabinet on 
<br/>decision-making  processes  that  will  be  adopted  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability.    An 
<br/>example of this is that residents of municipalities will soon have the opportunity to choose their own 
<br/>representatives in elections for city and town councils.  Democracy will be broadened and localised 
<br/>further  with  the  empowerment  of  rural  communities  to  choose  their  advisory  councillors  through 
<br/>elections.  The councillors are the vital link in gathering data and deploying assistance to our rural 
<br/>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  pressing  issues  facing  the  nation,  particularly  on  the  economy,  Government  must 
<br/>recognise that the private sector is a critical driver of economic growth.   They need freedom and 
<br/>flexibility to pursue their aims but they must operate within the law and respect the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government must put into place necessary measures so that there is a level playing field, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>certainty and consistency of policies that will boost confidence across the board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government will work in partnership with all stakeholders (vis-à-vis private sector, the 
<br/>trade unions, civil society organisations and traditional institutions) in working together to grow and 
<br/>diversify our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To do this, the Government must get its own economic house in order.  By July this year, it 
<br/>is anticipated that our national debt will reach the FJ$10 billion mark.  This represents approximately 
<br/>85 percent of our GDP.  There is another FJ$1.8 billion in contingent liabilities.  These are mainly in 
<br/>the form of loan guarantees, some of which are expected to be called up.  This amounts to around 15 
<br/>percent of GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  debt  level  severely  limits  the  Coalition  Government’s  capacity  to  borrow  further  for 
<br/>critical  expenditure  on  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  ports,  hospitals,  water  and  sewerage.    Our 
<br/>national debt also restricts Government’s ability to direct spending into key areas such as education, 
<br/>health and social welfare payments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  small  nation  with  narrow  resource-based  economy,  prone  to  natural  disasters  and 
<br/>geographically-isolated, it is important that we must continue to take a cautious approach as we face 
<br/>headwinds.  We have been reminded of these challenges on many occasions.  At the same time, the 
<br/></span><span>Government must foster and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations with our close neighbours 
<br/></span><span>to attract much-needed development assistance and trade access.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In its first month in office, the Government has been responding to urgent demands while 
<br/>assessing the state of our finances and re-prioritising and redeploying funds for urgent and critical 
<br/>needs.  It will be necessary over the next few months to embark on a comprehensive financial review.  
<br/>The focus will be on consolidating government finance to improve revenue and reduce waste and 
<br/>mismanagement in expenditure so that the limit the resources can be directed to priority areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  will  also  concentrate  on  building  confidence  and  trust  with  businesses  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investors, with regards to future policy and legislative initiatives and incentives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultation  and  collaboration  on  socio-economic  issues  facing  the  nation  is  essential.  
<br/>Shortly,  the  Government  will  announce  the  appointment  of  a  Fiscal  Review  Committee.  The 
<br/>Committee  will,  as  in  the  past,  examine  the  overall  setting  of  fiscal  policy,  revenue-raising  and 
<br/>expenditures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee will identify strategies consistent with best practices to ensure Government’s 
<br/>fiscal sustainability.  It will consult widely and is expected to report back in mid-May.  Its members 
<br/>will also participate in the proposed National Economic Summit scheduled to take place towards the 
<br/>end of April.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Summit is intended to be an inclusive one, bringing together a wide cross-section of our 
<br/>community and organisations to help shape the way forward for the country in the next four years, 
<br/>and assist in the formulation of our National Budget.  It will also contribute to an economic policy 
<br/>framework to support sustainable growth in the short and medium-term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  cannot  manage  its  finances  without  good  measuring  tools  and  personnel 
<br/>committed  to  long-term  objectives.  The  re-establishment  of  the  Ministry  of  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National  Development  and  Statistics  will  be  given  priority,  to  ensure  better  coordination  and 
<br/>formulation of a strategic and robust development agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bureau of Statistics will be strengthened. It will operate independently, providing reliable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and timely data for public information and use. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the context of short-term economic outcomes, Government realises that supporting tourism 
<br/>is critical.  It has made a strong recovery since the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has not 
<br/>yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Traditional markets such as Australia and New Zealand remain 
<br/>important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airways, our national airline, which carries 70 percent of passengers to Fiji, is expanding 
<br/>its global network by investing in new routes such as direct flights to Vancouver. The resumption of 
<br/>direct flights between Nadi and Narita in the near future will improve visitor arrivals and trade with 
<br/>Japan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance will be working closely with the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications to improve the ease of doing business for local 
<br/>and overseas investors alike.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will ensure policy transparency to build investor confidence. The objective is to 
<br/>create  a  more  attractive  environment  for  commerce  and  industry  generally  and  new  investors  in 
<br/>particular. Bottlenecks in the administrative system that deter potential investors will be removed, so 
<br/>will unnecessary red-tape. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will also have a very clear direction in diversifying the economy, thus reducing 
<br/>our dependency on a narrow market-base and address our vulnerability both, to natural disasters and 
<br/>international shocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade policy will aim to enhance diversification by increasing new products and markets. To 
<br/>do this will require building competitive advantage through incentives and other initiatives to bring 
<br/>new products to the market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The important role in economic recovery of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) 
<br/></span><span>is also recognised.  They can serve the local and export trade. Advisory and development services 
<br/>will be made available. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Bill to serve the needs of this 
<br/>sector will be finalised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New efforts will be directed in revitalising the co-operatives movement. The Co-operatives 
<br/>Act will be reformed and updated for better organisation and outcomes.  New support programmes 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be considered for women, youth and people with disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are renewed efforts to revive the sugar industry which provides a livelihood for a fair 
<br/>share of our population, particularly farmers and landowners.  Plans are currently being formulated 
<br/>to increase cane planting, production and harvesting, with improved mechanisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will establish a Special Parliamentary Committee on the Sugar Sector to set clear 
<br/>and  tangible  strategies  and  targets.  Farmers  and  landowners  will  be  brought  back  into  the 
<br/>organisational structure of the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  must  respect  the  human  rights  of  every  person  in  Fiji  as  guaranteed  in  the 
<br/>Constitution of Republic of Fiji 2013, as well as the rights of all communities in Fiji.  We must also 
<br/>continue to recognise the rights of the first peoples of this nation or the iTaukei, and the people of 
<br/>Rotuma, as guaranteed in international agreements, such as the International Labour Organisation 
<br/>Convention No. 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, as well as in United 
<br/>Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Indigenous rights are a category of human rights similar to women's rights, the rights of the 
<br/>disabled and the rights of children.  In recognising these rights, Government does not seek to place 
<br/>indigenous  rights  above  the  rights  of  members  of  our  minority  ethnic  communities,  given  the 
<br/>indivisibility and equality of human rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Great  Council  of  Chiefs  (GCC),  traditionally  the  apex  of  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>is  to  be  re-
<br/>established.  Its first meeting will take place in late May.  Government will undertake consultations 
<br/>and preparatory work before bringing the relevant Bills to this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am reminded by the words of the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy, who addressed the Council of 
<br/>Chiefs in 1997 as the Leader of the Opposition.  He asked the Chiefs to consider themselves leaders, 
<br/>not just of the iTaukei, but of all Fijians.  He reminded them that Indo-Fijians did not wish to separate 
<br/>themselves from their iTaukei brothers and sisters.  And speaking for the Indo-Fijian community, he 
<br/>told the Chiefs, and I quote: “Fiji is our home.  Fiji is our only home. We have no other. We want no 
<br/>other.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  principal  iTaukei  statutes  will  be  reviewed.  They  include,  the  iTaukei  Affairs  Act, 
<br/>iTaukei Lands Act, iTaukei Lands Trust Act, iTaukei Trust Fund Act and iTaukei Development Fund 
<br/>Act. This will position the relevant institutions to deliver their mandates efficiently and effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei institutions will be reviewed. Institutions, such as the iTaukei Affairs Board, and 
<br/>Provincial,  Tikina  and  Village  Councils  will  be  strengthened.    The  iTaukei  Lands  and  Fisheries 
<br/>Commission,  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board,  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  Board  and  the  Centre  for 
<br/>Appropriate Technology and Development (CATD) will also be reviewed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  the  aim  is  to  enable  effective  service  delivery  consistent  with  the  Government’s 
<br/>mandate  in  accordance  with  the  universal  standards  of  the  UN  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of 
<br/>Indigenous Peoples and ILO Convention 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.  A 
<br/></span><span>prime objective is to improve the economic position of the iTaukei and lift the living standards of 
<br/></span><span>villages and settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  recognises  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  for  the  iTaukei  to  increase  their 
<br/>involvement in commerce.  To help achieve this, an inaugural iTaukei Resource Owners Forum will 
<br/>bring together resource owners and advisors with the necessary expertise to develop a roadmap for 
<br/>moving forward.  This is an example of the inclusive approach that Government will continue to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>embrace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the health sector, the Government is drafting plans for the revival of medical and hospital 
<br/>services by improving and maintaining facilities, service, skills training and patient care.  Functional 
<br/>Divisional Command Centres will strengthen service delivery and coordination of grassroots health 
<br/>programmes.  Emphasis will be given to better access to electricity, connectivity and water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community  engagement  and  ownership  are  seen  as  key  to  attaining  better  health  service 
<br/>coverage.  There will be particular emphasis on improving services and divisional and sub-divisional 
<br/>hospitals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Effectively managing the diabetes crisis is a priority for the Government, as well as dealing 
<br/>with the prevalence of other Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).  These ailment account for 85 
<br/>percent of all the deaths in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The education system will be directed towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 
<br/>(SDGs) and for our children and tertiary students to reach their full potential.  The recent back-to-
<br/>school  support  programme  underscored  the  Government’s  commitment  to  helping  families  with 
<br/>education costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major undertaking is the establishment of an Education Commission to review the entire 
<br/>education  system  in  the  country  and  make  recommendations  for  improvement  in  the  quality  of 
<br/>teaching  and leadership of our school system  and the curriculum to meet the needs of our labour 
<br/>market.  Government will then convene an Education Summit, bringing together all stakeholders to 
<br/>consider  the  recommendations  of  the  Education  Commission  and  formulate  a  national  education 
<br/>policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  is  moving  to  rebuild  Fiji’s  relationship  with  the  University  of  the  South 
<br/>Pacific  while  maintaining  synergy  with  the  University  of  Fiji  and  the  Fiji  National  University  in 
<br/>meeting the labour market demands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Policies for the ongoing development of young people and sports are central to the overall 
<br/>wellbeing of the nation.  Government is committed to ensure that youth have access to knowledge, 
<br/>skills  and  training,  so  that  they  can  effectively  participate  and  contribute  to  nation  building.  
<br/>Enhancement of sport facilities will attract more international sporting events and tournaments to our 
<br/>shores, positioning Fiji as the Pacific’s sporting hub.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  revival  of  the  Rural  and  Outer  Islands  Development  Programme  will  boost  socio-
<br/>economic development in our rural setting.  The Programme will be directed at income generating 
<br/>projects, improved infrastructure and better services including affordable cyclone-resistant housing, 
<br/>power and water supplies, sanitation systems and livelihoods.  There will be improved coordination 
<br/>for disaster preparedness, response, recovery operations and mitigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will continue its efforts to end violence against women and girls and promote 
<br/>women’s economic empowerment.  The Government is determined that the needs and interests of 
<br/></span><span>women and girls will be reflected in the legislation, policies and the National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  will  be  continuing  emphasis  on  child  protection  with  the  ultimate  objective  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>establishing a Department for Children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Funding  for  Poverty  Benefit,  Social  Pension  and  Disability  Schemes  and  the  Bus  Fare 
<br/>Subsidy will continue.  Government will adopt a new targeting strategy to ensure the most vulnerable 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are assisted and protected.  A Poverty Monitoring Unit will monitor and report on poverty alleviation 
<br/>efforts in various Government agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At national level, agriculture will ensure all citizens have access to safe and nutritious food, 
<br/>and that farmers have guaranteed incomes from both, local and export markets.  Inclusive agricultural 
<br/>policies  for  young  people  and  women  will  be  strengthened,  along  with  development  of  specific 
<br/>commodities.  Farmers will be encouraged to work in clusters to facilitate access to markets, finance, 
<br/>training and technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In March, Government will host the Pacific Week of Agriculture.  This will bring together 
<br/>regional agricultural leaders and experts, promote alliances, mobilise donor support and will lead to 
<br/>join efforts to foster food security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Public Works Department (PWD) is to be reintroduced. Maintenance and upgrading of 
<br/>rural roads and river crossings will be a priority for the PWD.  It will also be responsible for rural 
<br/>water, electrification and sanitation services.  The people are suffering due to regular power and water 
<br/>cuts, Government will put into place necessary measures to address these long-standing issues and 
<br/>challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  will  re-establish  the  Tripartite  Forum,  comprising  of  Government, 
<br/>employers and trade unions.  It will play a pivotal role in issues relating to employment, productivity 
<br/>and industrial relations.  The reinstatement of tripartite wages councils to determine minimum wages 
<br/>for different sectors of the economy will be given priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  the  Vuvale</span><span> </span><span>Partnership  Programme,  Government  will  work  closely  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australian Government to improve opportunities for labour mobility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will ensure public enterprises follow the rules of transparency, good governance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and accountability in their respective operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  specialist  review  of  Fiji’s  defence  and  security  systems  will  be  undertaken.  This  will 
<br/>include finalising the National Security Strategy and the introduction of a related Defence Council 
<br/>Bill to provide the necessary legal framework.  The review of defence-related legislation is also a 
<br/>priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s border security is to be enhanced and harmonised with relevant international treaties.  
<br/></span><span>Government will accede to the Arms Trade Treaty and International Convention on Maritime Search 
<br/></span><span>and  Rescue  after  requisite  parliamentary  process  is  undertaken.  The  existing  national  security 
<br/>architecture will be reinvigorated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will maintain its national focus on the critical issues of climate change and the 
<br/>environment.  There will be emphasis on aspects where Fiji can make the most impact locally, in the 
<br/>region and internationally.  Communities will be encouraged to work with Government in cleaning 
<br/>up their local environment and surroundings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our foreign policy will focus on restoring confidence and unity among our Pacific Islands 
<br/></span><span>Forum  Member  countries  and  building  stronger  relationships  with  friendly  countries.    This  is  of 
<br/>special significance at a time of manoeuvring by major powers for influence in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The media legislation will be reviewed to strengthen the freedom of the press and the people’s 
<br/>right to  information.   Government  is  taking a strong position on this,  along with  respect  for civil 
<br/>rights and freedom.

<div><span>An announcement will make soon on two new public holidays.  This includes a public holiday 
<br/>to commemorate the arrival of the Girmitiyas to Fiji in 1879, whose descendants are an integral part 
<br/>of our nation.  In addition, the national holiday marking the life and achievements of Ratu Sir Lala 
<br/>Sukuna will be gazetted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In moving forward, our focus now is to build bridges and bring unity among our different 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities to work together as one people and one nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To grow the economy, we must increase the size of the pie by diversifying our resource-based 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sectors that give us the greatest potential and opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must continue to improve on our infrastructure to meet the demands of a modern Fiji.  
<br/>Our  social  services,  particularly  health  and  education,  must  continue  to  be  improved  to  meet  the 
<br/>current and future needs of this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  vulnerability  to  increased  severity  and  frequency  of  natural  disasters  due  to  climate 
<br/>change cannot be ignored.  We must continue to put into place mitigation and adaptation strategies, 
<br/>with support from the international community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The change in our Government gives rise to the opportunity to bring our nation together and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>start afresh.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the honourable Speaker, honourable Members of Cabinet, honourable Members of the loyal 
<br/>Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I congratulate you on being called to serve Fiji and 
<br/>her people.  I urge you to deliberate with full intention, advocate with thoughtfulness and inclusivity, and 
<br/>debate with respect and finesse, and in all that you do, deliver on your sacred duty to the people of Fiji.  
<br/>It is my hope and prayer that you must all work together for the betterment of our nation, in cooperation 
<br/>and unity.  It has been my honour today to outline to you the plans and policies of the People’s Coalition 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  pray  that  the  Almighty  God  will  bless  the  Members  of  this  august  Parliament  in  your 
<br/>preparations for debate on what I have put out before you today. May the people of this land that we 
<br/>love be the ultimate beneficiaries of your collective wisdom.  I wish you all great success for this 
<br/>year, and it is now my duty and great honour to declare the 2023-2024 Parliamentary Session open. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji.  </span><span>Vina’a va’a levu be’a </span><span>and thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(His Excellency the President is escorted out of Parliament by the honourable Speaker and 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament)
