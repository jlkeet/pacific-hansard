<br/>opened by His Excellency the President.  I take this opportunity to thank you all for your presence 
<br/>on this auspicious occasion, as well as those joining us through the live broadcast of the proceedings 
<br/>on television and internet.  It would be remiss of me if I am not to thank the hard work undertaken 
<br/>by Madam Secretary-General and the staff in preparing this auspicious occasion.  It has been a tiring 
<br/>task working late into the night preparing this great occasion.

<br/>most gracious speech.  All honourable Members will speak in accordance with the Batting Order that 
<br/>has  been  circulated.    On  that  note,  I  thank  honourable  Members,  and  I  now  invite  you  all  to 
<br/>refreshments which will be served at the Big Committee Room.
