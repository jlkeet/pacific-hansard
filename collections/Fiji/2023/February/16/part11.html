<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON HIS EXCELLENCY’S ADDRESS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I join the honourable Prime Minister and other 
<br/>honourable  Members  in  congratulating  you  as  the  12th  Speaker  of  Fiji’s  Parliament  since 
<br/>Independence in 1970. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, you have our full support towards the discharge of your responsibilities. Your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>success is the success of the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is their freedoms and their rights that you ultimately are the 
<br/>steward  of.    Most  importantly,  Mr.  Speaker,  you  are  the  guarantor  of  dignity  and  decorum  of 
<br/>Parliament which is and shall always be a temple of democracy under your leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I move on, let me say a few words in </span><span>Hindi</span><span> and it is quite historic under 
<br/>your leadership and I want to thank you most sincerely for allowing </span><span>Hindi</span><span> and </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> to be used in 
<br/>Parliament as a language.  I want to say a few words in </span><span>Hindi</span><span> on the occasion of the World Hindi 
<br/>Conference that is currently being held in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker,  </span><span>Mahoday,  12th  Vishva  Hindi  Sammelan  </span><span>(Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  12</span><span>th</span><span>  World  Hindi

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by you on Channel 2 on the audio system that is in front of you.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/>filhal Nadi, Fiji mein ho rahi hai.  Iska udghatan kal hamare desh ke rashtrapati ji ne ek bahut hi 
<br/>paramparik swagat dwara kiya gaya.  Is sammelan mein lagbhag ek hazaaer se zyada log bhaag le 
<br/>rahe hai.  Sabse zyada, Speaker Mahoday, Bharat aur anye desho mein jaha Hindi bola jata hai, 
<br/>Hindi ki padhai-likhai bhi hoti hai.

<div><span>[Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 12</span><span>th</span><span> World Hindi Conference is currently taking place in Nadi, Fiji. It 
<br/></span><span>was inaugurated yesterday by the President of our country with a very traditional reception.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Mr. Speaker Sir, it is a matter of pleasure that the 12th World Hindi Conference is being held 
<br/>in Fiji this time. The conference was inaugurated yesterday by the President of Fiji, with a 
<br/>special  and  traditional  welcome.  More  than  one  thousand  people  are  participating  in  this 
<br/>conference. The largest number of people from India are included in it. 
<br/>There are many such Hindi scholars, experts in Hindi, those who teach Hindi literature and 
<br/>Hindi language, promote and spread it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  delegation,  on  behalf  of  the  Government  of  India,  is  headed  by  the  beloved  Foreign 
<br/>Minister of India, Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Fiji Government, last night, the Prime Minister welcomed the World Hindi 
<br/></span><span>Conference and, in that ceremony, present were our colleagues, the Attorney-General, Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, Mr. Gavoka, and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Manoa Kamikamica.]

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prutah ke neeche gaye the, unka</span><span> </span><span>jo mel-milaap hai, wo is sammelan ke dwara badhega.  Iske alawa, 
<br/>Hindi bhasha ka jo prachaar tatha prasaar hai, ko badhawa milega.  Ek baar fir mai Bharat Sarkar 
<br/>aur hamaare </span><span>Fiji</span><span> Sarkar ke jitne bhi log is sammelan ki ayojana mein lage hue hai, unko  vishesh 
<br/>dhanyevaad de raha hoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Mr. Speaker, Sir, this World Hindi Conference is a historical event for Fiji because Fiji is 
<br/>the only country that is, apart from India, where Hindi has been treated as an official language.  
<br/>And in this Conference, the relation between Fiji and India and other countries where Indians 
<br/>went under the ‘Girmit ’will be able to enhance their bonding once again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from this, the process of promoting and spreading Hindi language will be enhanced, is 
<br/>used and spread, and it will be improved. Once again, I would like to thank the Government 
<br/>of  India  and  our  Government  of  Fiji,  as  many  people  as  possible  who  are  involved  in 
<br/>organising this Conference.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the lead up to the 2022 General Election, we preached about an alternative 
<br/>to the bleak future facing Fiji and our citizens in the form of poverty, unemployment, state of decay 
<br/>of our public health and medical facilities, infrastructure, sugar industry struggling to survive, the 
<br/>agriculture  sector  in  a  state  of  neglect,  record  national  debt  levels,  wastage,  pilferage, 
<br/>mismanagement  of  public  funds  and  above  all  a  population  gripped  by  fear  because  of  lack  of 
<br/>freedom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the campaign, we were attacked both on social media mostly through 
<br/>fake and fictitious accounts by our political opponents and a party that had been in government for 
<br/>16 years, both as a party and an unelected regime.  We were accused of racial persecution, economic 
<br/>deprivation, sacking and reducing wages in the civil service and removing tuition free education to 
<br/>name a few, if we formed government.  That was the fear spread by many of those sitting on the other 
<br/>side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, such behaviour is symptomatic of those who do not want to give 
<br/>up power and I will say more on this later.  But let me tell the people of Fiji - the People’s Alliance, 
<br/>National Federation Party and the SODELPA Coalition Government is all about national interest, as 
<br/>the last 54 days of our governance has proven.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right  at  the  outset  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  election  of  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and the formation of the Coalition Government a day before Christmas, 
<br/>the euphoria of the people Mr. Speaker, Sir, was demonstrated through tooting of car horns, beating 
<br/>of tins as make-shift drums and explosion of firecrackers signified one sole fundamental element – 
<br/>Freedom! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TURAGA.- Yes  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Fiji became free of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TURAGA.- Free at last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Removal of the prohibited immigrant status on Doctor Padma 
<br/>Narsey Lal enabling her and the children to bring home Professor Brij Lal’s ashes to his final resting

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>place in Tabia, in nine days’ time it is highly symptomatic.  I want to thank the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister for making that issue a campaign issue and his commitment to correct that.  It will put to an 
<br/>end  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  13  years  of  a  tragic  chapter  heaped  on  a  true  son  of  Fiji  and  his  wife, 
<br/>banished from their land of birth by a cruel and heartless regime and refused re-entry by the former 
<br/>FijiFirst Government, simply because these two people wanted restoration of democracy in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pre-eminent story on Girmit in Fiji and elsewhere, he was recognised and respected for 
<br/>his works, research and immeasurable knowledge.  He was a man of impeccable integrity and was 
<br/>prevented from coming home because the order to ban him came from the Prime Minister’s office 
<br/>and we all know who the Prime Minister was for the last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TURAGA.- Oh, yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Name him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the return of the University  of the South 
<br/>Pacific  Vice  Chancellor,  Professor  Pal  Ahluwalia  to  the  USP  campus  a  few  days  ago,  buries  the 
<br/>unlawful  saga  of  him  and  his  wife  nabbed  at  midnight,  deported  from  Fiji  by  the  very  same 
<br/>government that now preaches and I hear that, now preaches its own concocted version of the rule of 
<br/>law in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The declaration of a public holiday for Girmit Day to honour and pay tribute to our forefathers 
<br/>whose  blood,  sweat,  tears  is  the  fulfilment  of  a  promised  made  by  the  leaders  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government led by the honourable Prime Minister … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TURAGA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … to honour those who laid the foundation for a modern and 
<br/>progressive nation with their bare hands – poles apart from the outright rejection by the former Prime 
<br/>Minister on this very same floor of Parliament on my adjournment motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would remember that almost  seven years ago in  April 2016 when I 
<br/>asked their government to declare 11</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2016 as a public holiday, this was to commemorate 
<br/>the 100</span><span>th</span><span> anniversary of the arrival of the last ship carrying  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> or indentured Indians.  
<br/>They did  not,  and they talked about racial unity.  They talk about one  Fiji, yet  the former Prime 
<br/>Minister and now the honourable Leader of the Opposition obviously through his now sin-binned 
<br/>side kick has the propensity to make wild and baseless accusations under the privilege accorded in 
<br/>this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision, Mr. Speaker, to mark the life and works of Fiji’s first statesman, Ratu Sir Lala 
<br/>Sukuna, as a public holiday, is a slap on the face of the honourable Leader of the Opposition, whose 
<br/>regime  abolished  this  holiday.    Children  who  were  15  years  old,  now  almost  30  years  old,  they 
<br/>probably  do  not  know  about  this  Statesman.    To  dishonour  Fiji’s  first  Statesman  whose  political 
<br/></span><span>tutelage shaped the ideologies of many great leaders like the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Ratu Sir 
<br/></span><span>Penaia Ganilau, Ratu Sir George Cakobau and others who have studied Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna about 
<br/>his  contribution  to  Fiji  and  on  the  land  issue,  and  many  of  us  have  benefitted  from  reading  and 
<br/>understanding that great man’s vision of what Fiji should be.  Again Mr. Speaker, that was an assault 
<br/>on the values of embodiment and chiefly wisdom by a regime that not only believed in my way or 
<br/>the highway rule.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To decide to restore grants to the USP and release the first payment of $10 million is not 
<br/>unconstitutional, Mr. Speaker, but the beginning of ensuring that the University staff and students 
<br/>are assured that they will have the best teaching and learning environment.  The payment of $200 
<br/>each for every child from early childhood education to Year -13 from a family earning a combined 
<br/>income  of  less  than  $50,000,  as  back  to  school  relief  was  not  palatable  to  FijiFirst.    Why,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker?  Why?  It is because it provided huge and genuine relief to parents and guardians and made 
<br/>education genuinely free.  It was better than a </span><span>saqamoli</span><span>, or a dollar-a-day, or a total of $180 for six 
<br/>months that was pre-election gimmick by the now punch-drunk FijiFirst Party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Punch-drunk!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- To undertake fiscal review, to hold an economic summit is 
<br/>part  of  the  consultative  process  and  inclusivity  of  this  Coalition  Government.    This  Coalition 
<br/>Government!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Tell them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is vastly different from an Economy Minister, who was also 
<br/>the State’s chief legal advisor, holding public forums around the country just for the sake of it where 
<br/>civil servants are told to attend to make up the numbers to pull wool over the eyes of the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In December 2021, Mr. Speaker, we were told by the then PM and now honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition how USP students were studying in an environment of corruption.  He tried vainly 
<br/>to justify his government’s decision to withhold the grant because of some egoistic behaviour of his 
<br/>government  and  particularly  of  his  then  Attorney-General,  who  has  excused  himself  out  of 
<br/>Parliament.  Of course, the former government stifled any reference or debate on the BDO Report 
<br/>findings that incriminated a lot of personalities, with all intents and purposes, who were sympathetic 
<br/>towards the FijiFirst Government.  The rest is history, Mr. Speaker, and that sordid chapter of USP 
<br/>history  is  best  buried  with  the  deviousness  of  a  political  party  under  whose  reign,  financial 
<br/>extravagance at the expense of the taxpayers has been in top gear as revealed by recent findings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, Mr. Speaker, had a government that could not even paint our hospitals.  We produced 
<br/>pictures in this Parliament.  I have produced pictures of health centres around the country.  Instead, 
<br/>it allowed grass to grow on the walls of the hospitals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the few anecdotes that I have outlined proves 
<br/>one fact.  It proves one fact – that the Coalition Government and FijiFirst are like riverbanks; never 
<br/>to come together because of a gulf in principles of transparency, accountability, good governance 
<br/>and adherence to the rule of law.   The Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker and I know the leaders 
<br/>as leaders of the three Parties, we know that the Coalition Government is here to stay and is the best 
<br/>alternative, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hear! Hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is the best alternative to put right the ills plaguing our nation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the past 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, that is right.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>171 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, on 15</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2014 during my maiden speech 
<br/>in Parliament, I was very new at that time and you were around at that time as well. and I said this 
<br/>and I want to quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“… with clarity about our vision, certainty about the reforms needed to realise that, 
<br/>with some luck and the grace of God, a future of great possibilities lies within our grasp.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government,  Mr. Speaker, will reset  the moral  compass of Fiji.   Central  to 
<br/>these  tasks  is  the  restoration  of  all  freedoms,  democratisation  of  institutions  like  the  Municipal 
<br/>Councils, Sugarcane Growers Council and as you know the Cabinet has already made the decision, 
<br/>the honourable Ministers are working on it.  On Monday I heard honourable Praveen Bala said he 
<br/>would contest the municipal elections.  Maybe he is thinking of leaving Parliament too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, yes he will. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  He  should  be  thankful,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government that he will be able to fulfil his wish if he wanted to.  I want to remind him. Immediately 
<br/>upon  swearing  in  as  Local  Government  Minister  in  September  2014  I  remember  he  was  sitting 
<br/>somewhere there; he promised that there would be Local Government Elections. That promise never 
<br/>materialised but what emerged was the $12 million swimming pool scam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there will also be a review and reform of legislations imposed upon the people 
<br/>through  decrees  which  automatically  became  Acts  under  the  2013  Constitution  without  any 
<br/>ratification on the floor. You also know that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic growth and financial stability are dependent on accountability and transparency - 
<br/>the  two  vital  features  of  good  governance  sorely  lacking  in  the  last  16  years.    Mr.  Speaker,  the 
<br/>Coalition Government as you know will soon hold an International Economic Summit and outline 
<br/>its plans for the future. We are consulting our citizens, our business stakeholders and they are with 
<br/>us in this journey to build an inclusive and prosperous economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are not daunted by the $10 billion debt because we assured the nation that 
<br/>we will fix it. During the last 16 years the regime and the FijiFirst Government put together, borrowed 
<br/>a whopping $7 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Coalition Government’s Minister of Finance, I am discovering areas of how wastage 
<br/>was happening. Some even bordering on financial negligence and abuse of authority.  This will be 
<br/>revealed in the near future.  On the positive side, Mr. Speaker, there is a sense of optimism. There is 
<br/>a sense of exuberance. The Minister of Trade and Commerce and Investment, the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and myself have been meeting businesses and investors - 
<br/>there is a sense of optimism, people like this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They want to invest now, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Hear! Hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are telling us and we are making that happen.  Also, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, with God’s grace, we are seeing positive indicators everywhere.  And that is why I want to 
<br/>say that over the next four years the Coalition Government will try and secure $1 billion worth of 
<br/>investment in our tourism sector; grow the sugar and agriculture industry into a billion dollar industry 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but these industries can and should become the backbone of our economy; target $1 billion worth of 
<br/>investment into climate, resilient infrastructure and into our blue economy; secure a million dollar 
<br/>investment into manufacturing and food processing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  sense  of  optimism,  sense  of  confidence,  people  who  were  living  overseas,  the 
<br/>remittances  have  crossed  a  billion-dollar  mark,  Mr.  Speaker.    And  above  all,  we  want  to  reduce 
<br/>wasteful expenditure by a billion dollar in the next four years.  We will grow our economy; we will 
<br/>share the prosperity and we will reduce the debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But most important element, Mr. Speaker, in this political philosophical agenda and economic 
<br/>agenda of the Coalition Government is to improve the governance because no matter what you do 
<br/>and how much you can juggle with economic policies, but if your governance is not right, you will 
<br/>not be able to secure that economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday,  we  had  a  lecture  on  secularism  from  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  who 
<br/>made disparaging remarks against me and the NFP for turning a blind eye to destroy secularism.  For 
<br/>all  intentional  purposes,  he  was  accusing  me  of  turning  a  blind  eye  and  ignoring  discrimination 
<br/>against Indo-Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are not the Speaker! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  filth  verbose  from  the  honourable  Member  was  not  surprising,  who  probably  did  not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>realise what was scripted for him was not only derogatory but inciteful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I mean, I know he has suddenly become a small parrot for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General Secretary of the FijiFirst Party… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Nothing new, nothing new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- He’s written his speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am told that he has got something on him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And that, Mr. Speaker, came from someone sitting there, who kept his mouth shut.  When 
<br/>Mr. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum attacked the Vishva Hindu Parishad organisation that he was part of, as 
<br/>a terrorist organisation, he kept quiet.  Not long ago, he was campaigning for NFP in 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVT. MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not know what happened suddenly, Mr. Speaker, and you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can see the filth that is coming from him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he was attacking me in Parliament when, I, together with honourable Agni 
<br/>Deo Singh, were in Denarau, Nadi, participating in the World Hindi Conference, that was, as I have 
<br/>said  in  Hindi,  officially  opened  by  His  Excellency  the  President.  We  know,  Sir,  the  high-level 
<br/>conference  is  being  attended  by  India’s  Minister  for  External  Affairs,  His  Excellency  Dr. 
<br/>Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.  I also said that last night, the honourable Prime Minister hosted a dinner

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>173 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for  all  the  participants  in  Denarau,  and  today  we  are  going  to  have  bilateral  meetings  with  Dr. 
<br/>Jaishankar later in the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact that the World Hindi Conference is being held in Fiji, the fact that 
<br/>the  honourable  Prime  Minister  himself  with  the  leader  of  the  SODELPA  Party,  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister  Kamikamica,  and  myself,  decided  that  we  are  going  to  recognise  Girmit  as  a  national 
<br/>holiday shows that this Coalition Government is an inclusive serious Government understanding that 
<br/>this nation is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious nation…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVT. MEMBERS.- Hear, hear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …just  like  India  which  is  the  largest  secular  State.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, he probably does not understand the meaning of secularism and ethnonationalism.  As a 
<br/>Johnny-come-lately, reading the script by someone who has propagated this racial hatred for the last 
<br/>eight years in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, you’re correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I remember whenever an honourable Member of SODELPA 
<br/>Party would stand up and talk about  how iTaukei  community in the outer islands is  facing  water 
<br/>problem, he or she would be accused of racism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPP. MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government is trying to bring the people 
<br/>together.  They did nothing in the last eight years in Parliament to bring people together.  All they 
<br/>did was to campaign on racial line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen parties come and disappear, and I want to remind people like honourable Ketan 
<br/>Lal, that NFP is going to be 60 years old in July this year.  We are the oldest party, Mr. Speaker, and 
<br/>you are aware of that, in the South Pacific and comments like that is not going to make a dent on our 
<br/>philosophy and our idea of what Fiji should be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen, Mr. Speaker, that in the last eight years and before that, Fiji has been governed 
<br/>by two men, treating this country like their own personal property. And they thought that they will 
<br/>be in power for eternity, in fact, the honourable Leader of the Opposition now, in one of his interviews 
<br/>said,  “We  want  to  rule  in  perpetuity”,  and  they  talk  about  democracy.    So,  the  behaviour  and 
<br/>utterances, Mr. Speaker, from the Opposition show that they are actually experiencing excruciating 
<br/>pain at the loss of their power.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is shameful the kind of things they say because it lowers the dignity.  You were attacked, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, it lowest  the dignity  of Parliament and they  are worried that  the People’s  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government - the empathy, the compassion that we are showing to the people of this country, they 
<br/>know that they will be history, and their cabal that ran the country will be useless and insignificant 
<br/>and this is what we want to add, Mr. Speaker.  This shameful episode has become a thing of the past.  
<br/>Better days, months and years await our people because finally, Mr. Speaker, Fiji is a government of 
<br/>the people.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by saying that the vision of 
<br/>the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy and the honourable Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, which they set 
<br/>out to achieve 23 years ago, Mr. Speaker, came to fruition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You will remember, Mr. Speaker, in 1999, we had a three-
<br/>Party  Coalition.  We  had  the  SVT,  GVP  and  the NFP.  Today,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  proud  that  with 
<br/>honourable Rabuka and with honourable Gavoka. we have achieved that vision, that the late Justice 
<br/>Jai Ram Reddy and honourable Sitiveni Rabuka had in 1999 and we have a solid Government of 
<br/>three Parties leading this nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T. K. RAYALU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  want  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  for  his  most 
<br/>gracious Address.  May he continue to be an embodiment of chiefly authority, wisdom and symbol 
<br/>of unity for our beloved nation.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, may God bless Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you may have noted that I have allowed more time 
<br/>for the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor Biman Prasad, to continue with his speech, and 
<br/>if I may borrow a word and that is to do with the ‘glitch’ that happened with our IT here.  So, that is 
<br/>the reason why I have allowed a lot more time to the Deputy Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, I was flexible in the past few days with people going over their time because 
<br/>most are making their maiden speech. Secondly, most are trying to score a punch or two, having been 
<br/>served in Parliament in the past.  So, it is a fair game, honourable Members, and I hope you will bear 
<br/>with me.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition,  honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant  Ministers, my colleagues  - 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament; good morning and thank you for the opportunity to share my 
<br/>Maiden Speech with you all this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate you and the honourable Deputy Speaker for accepting the 
<br/>responsibility of this high office.  I am aware of the steep learning and the deep responsibility that 
<br/>lies ahead of me.  I am  also equally aware that my voice as a responsible Member of this august 
<br/>Parliament needs to be heard as I have voters counting on me to be their consistent voice to contribute 
<br/>to  meaningful  debates,  and  to  question  and  scrutinise  legislation  and  to  hold  the  new  Coalition 
<br/>Government  accountable.  Already, those who have voted for me, have contributed to  what  I am 
<br/>bringing into this Chamber today, as I represent their concerns and needs for representation.  It is my 
<br/>privilege to be with you all and I eagerly look forward to these responsibilities.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to begin, I would say a little about myself, the brief story of my beginning 
<br/>that sums up why I am here today and why I am eager to contribute to this Chamber and make a 
<br/>difference – my purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 30 years ago as an eight-year-old, I left my village in Naselesele, Wainikeli, 
<br/>Taveuni, to stay with families in Suva, an opportunity my parents thought would help me attain a 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>175 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more wholesome education with the guidance of the Marist Brothers.  My parents meant well, but it 
<br/>was one of the most challenging times of my life.  I had to adjust to living with relatives and learn to 
<br/>make  do  with  whatever  I  was  provided  with,  including  getting  used  to  living  in  a  cramped  one-
<br/>bedroom flat at Toorak housing, or what some of you may know as Texas Town.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I lived a life of obligation, restriction and tolerance.  Through education and sports, I quickly 
<br/>grasped self-discipline and perseverance.  As  I progressed through the workforce,  I never looked 
<br/>back and I vowed to use my story to inspire others, especially the undervalued youth, not to be limited 
<br/>by challenging situations, and always strive to value God and excellence in what they do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 42 years on, I have given back to my country by serving in the Military for 
<br/>31 years, then worked in the Fiji Corrections Service for four years, before a further three years in 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force.  After serving the Disciplinary Services, I continued my service at the national 
<br/>level for five years as a Diplomat and as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  leaving  public  life,  I  transitioned  to  working  in  the  community  through  being  the 
<br/>President  of  the  Basketball  Fiji,  a  member  of  FASANOC,  the  Pacific  Security  College  and  by 
<br/>volunteering with several NGOs - all of which provided fresh perspectives and the importance of 
<br/>working together with the community.  God has, indeed, given me many opportunities to serve my 
<br/>nation, and I am genuinely thankful for that.  I am also certain that He has not finished with me yet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my oath before God, before His Excellency the President and before the 
<br/>nation, was a solemn and humbling occasion.  It reaffirmed my commitment to my country, and that 
<br/>I was being given another chance to serve.  I stand ready to serve the vulnerable, those who have 
<br/>been displaced, the unloved in our society and our youth - young men and women, who desire to 
<br/>grow up in a nation that can provide them with an opportunity and a future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Over the years, what has developed and continues to live within me is the value of giving 
<br/>back.  It is through bringing this value to action that I have learned not only to know myself more, 
<br/>but also better understand who we are as a people and as a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In December 2023, the people of Fiji concluded voting and a new Coalition Government was 
<br/>appointed to carry on the excellent work and contribution of the FijiFirst Party over the past 16 years.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what was provided to this new Coalition Government was a firm base upon which 
<br/>Fiji was and can continue to move forward into the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century, or as I prefer to say, into the twenty-
<br/>fast century.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate the honourable Prime Minister.  I also express my 
<br/>congratulations to the new Coalition Government and echo the sentiment shared by His Excellency 
<br/>the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, in his Address during the opening of Parliament earlier this 
<br/>month, and I quote: “You now have the responsibility of leading our nation for the next four years”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- To the honourable Members sitting opposite me in this Chamber, 
<br/></span><span>the challenges of bringing the words of His Excellency the President to action for the benefit of all 
<br/></span><span>Fijians is very real.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I remind the honourable Members of the Coalition Government that 
<br/>what  confronts  them  is  not  a  social  media  rating  exercise,  nor  is  it  preparing  for  the  next  photo 
<br/>opportunity, but what remains is the real task of bringing their promises to policy and their intentions 
<br/>to implementation. As I observe their earlier attempts, I see real and concerning inconsistencies in  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how this is being handled and managed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  also  remind  honourable  Members  of  the  new  Government  that 
<br/>FijiFirst set the important groundwork that clearly built the framework to secure our country towards 
<br/>a progressive future.  What  we see and experience now is  the result of the many resourceful and 
<br/>productive policies and legislations implemented.  The legacy of FijiFirst continues today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite challenges along the way, the leadership of the former Prime Minister, retired Rear 
<br/>Admiral Voreqe Bainimarama, if I may commend him, had the best interests of our nation at heart.  
<br/>He governed astutely and steered our country successfully out of several disasters with </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>
<br/>in 2016, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> in 2020 and let us not forget the COVID-19 global pandemic.  Those disasters 
<br/>affected each one of us - it threatened our health system, economy and livelihoods, not forgetting the 
<br/>individuals who lost their lives to this pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  former  Prime  Minister  and  now  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  uniquely 
<br/>shaped our country to  be recognised globally  in  its role in  climate change, trade, labour mobility 
<br/>negotiations,  defence  co-operation  and  peacekeeping,  embracing  information  technology  and 
<br/>empowering the young and the old through free education access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most recently, His Excellency the President of the United States of America wrote from the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>White House in a letter dated 4</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023 which states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I  applaud  your  legacy  in  building  Fiji’s  democratic  culture  and  institution, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including welcoming all Fijians regardless of their background.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- These transformative advancements which international leaders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now recognise have contributed to the building of a stable and unified Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst has strategically positioned our country and set it apart by fast-
<br/>tracking development and providing modern solutions to our current problems to meet the challenges 
<br/>of our future.  The direction and focus of the previous FijiFirst Government were to connect the world 
<br/>to Fiji (I say again, connect the world to Fiji), making it not only a regional hub but a global hub.  
<br/>The world is attracted to Fiji because it is safe, secure and stable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of the Coalition Government have challenging tasks 
<br/>ahead and big shoes to fill.  I would like to make it clear that Fiji cannot and will not move forward 
<br/>by using yesterday’s solutions to tomorrow’s problems.  Yet, even as I say this, I, and the rest of the 
<br/>country, see the dust being brushed off old stories and old playbooks in an attempt by the Coalition 
<br/>Government to demonstrate that they have answers and solutions for Fiji in the “twenty-fast century. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our people are listening and watching, anticipating what fresh ideas this 
<br/>Government will bring to the table.  We demand a government that upholds the values of national 
<br/>unity, and an Opposition that will hold the Government to account.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  We  wait  to  see  how  the  debate  and  decisions  the  Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>brings to this Chamber will benefit the future generations of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of the Coalition have said publicly about dismantling 
<br/>FijiFirst  16-year  legacy.  I  see  the  cracks  of  dismantling  happening  within  their  own  ranks  and 
<br/>question how they will shoulder the responsibility of what it is to govern in the best interests of all 
<br/>Fijians.    Of  critical  importance  is  that  further  steps  are  not  taken  to  undermine  the  stability  and 
<br/>security of the nation through dismantling or eroding the stabilising institutions and in here I mean, 
<br/>the  Republic  of  Fiji  Military  Forces,  the  Fiji  Police  Force,  the  Judiciary  and  weakening  our 
<br/>democratic norms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Ask your leader! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2013, Fiji adopted a new Constitution that 
<br/>provided a framework for the advancement of all Fijians.  A Constitution that provides equality and 
<br/>opportunity  is  inclusive  and  secures  equal  representation  for  all.    Yet,  this  key  and  governing 
<br/>document has been attacked by some of the honourable Members of this Chamber sitting opposite 
<br/>me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the utterances from the honourable Members of this Chamber and 
<br/>from public leaders would seem to one to, again, divide us along lines of ethnicity and faith.  Yet, 
<br/>every nation that stands will find its strongest foundations built on true morality - where our lives are 
<br/>not lived selflessly but in service, consideration, and devout duty towards the other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, good governance requires serious attention to strategic,  fiscal, social and 
<br/>bread  and  butter  issues.    Again,  I  return  to  the  question  of  how  serious-minded  the  honourable 
<br/>Members sitting opposite me are about the task of fulfilling their promises.  I challenge honourable 
<br/>Coalition Members to fulfil those promises and get the job done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many listening to my Maiden Speech today will have heard me say, “find 
<br/>the heartbeat on the ground and connect your heartbeat to that heartbeat”.  It is critically important 
<br/>that the Coalition partners feel the correct heartbeat of the people.  Only then will you be able to align 
<br/>your policies to be effective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our responsibility to both demonstrate good leadership and also invest 
<br/>in good leadership.  Our modern Fiji requires good leaders who can serve without discrimination; 
<br/>true leaders who have the courage to unify and not stir up dissention and divide; and leaders whom 
<br/>our nation can trust, can be proud of and who inspire the next generation to follow in their footsteps. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to address this Chamber on an issue of personal passion, our young 
<br/>people.  Across this nation, our young people need to be given the right opportunities to be able to 
<br/>be good leaders in their communities.  I would also like, at this point, to acknowledge the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Youth  and  Sports  and  his  speech  to  this  Chamber  yesterday  where  he  shared  his 
<br/>commitment to the youth of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the past years, I have been involved in a number of youth initiatives in 
<br/>the community - one of most recent and unique and innovative programmes is the Devo Babas based 
<br/>in  Nadi.    This  is  a  Fijian-designed  programme  implemented  to  assist  unemployed  youth  through 
<br/></span><span>sports.  It has forged a vision of changing young people’s lives through a programme that started 
<br/></span><span>during the upheaval and uncertainty of COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 22 unemployed men from Bua in Vanualevu started the Devo Babas journey 
<br/>to become better young men. Through a mutual commitment of the leaders and the participants, these 
<br/>young men were nurtured, housed, challenged, and motivated in a holistic environment.  This unique 
<br/>approach changed unemployed village youth into skilled and employed young men through a process

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  tremendous  transformation,  personal  and  spiritual  growth,  discipline  and  standards,  and  by 
<br/>instilling into them what it is to learn, earn and live a life.  This example is a serious effort towards 
<br/>nation-building  that  I  would  commend  to  this  Chamber  and  was  achieved  with  the  consolidated 
<br/>support from the community, private sector, church and the Fiji Police Force. These young men are 
<br/>today contributing in the following ways:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>two are playing rugby on contracts in China; 
<br/>one is  serving as  a Corrections  Service  Officer, having  successfully passed  through his 
<br/>basic recruit; 
<br/>10 are now serving in the Fiji Police Force; and  
<br/>one is playing rugby in Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government was committed to nation-building and dedicated its policies and 
<br/>enacted  legislation  to  ensure  no  one  was  left  behind.    It  created  the  opportunity  for  home-grown 
<br/>initiatives, such as Devo Babas, to join and align to a national effort and find success. Devo Babas is 
<br/>a Fiji-made product that in its early success is a model that not only has returned on its investment, 
<br/>but also exportable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our youth, through the FijiFirst Government leadership, have accessed free 
<br/>education through to their secondary studies, accessed Student Loan Schemes for tertiary and higher 
<br/>education, and were able to access their right to the landowning unit shares. Those opportunities were 
<br/>never made available through the past Governments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  key  feature  of  any  developing  nation  is  to 
<br/>secure the future of its young people.  Over the years the FijiFirst Government worked hard to secure 
<br/>this future by improving justice for all. Allow me to highlight three examples, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, native lease payments was restructured so that all landholders received what 
<br/>was their right to receive. The wealth of the land now rested in the hands of those to whom it was a 
<br/>right  to  have  that  wealth,  allowing  the  individual  and  his  or  her  dependents  to  come  to  human 
<br/>flourishing.  This is a removal of past oppression and the gifting of justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, education of our children became both, a right and free.  No longer was it a 
<br/>decision of whom to educate because free education and bus travel ensured the right to education for 
<br/></span><span>all. The commitment to this decision has allowed for a whole new generation of human flourishing 
<br/></span><span>that will increase ability of young men and women to both, flourish and establish a good life.  Sir, 
<br/>this is justice in action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Yellow Ribbon initiative is close to my heart. This national restructuring 
<br/>and  repurposing  of  our  Corrections  system  shifted  the  focus  from  punitive  justice  to  restorative 
<br/>justice.  We boldly ask the Fijian people to welcome the offender and make room in their hearts and 
<br/>lives for the action of mercy.  Building this as an act of justice for our nation took courage and today, 
<br/>we see the reward of that courage with recidivism rates low and rehabilitation outcomes high.  Sir, 
<br/>this is justice in action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are a nation that lives within the tensions of honoured traditions, respected faiths with 
<br/>great potential and God willing, a bright future.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my ability to stand here in this 
<br/>Chamber  today  was  the  result  of  an  incredible  team  effort  of  dedicated  men  and  women  who 
<br/>encouraged, supported, advised, and gave of themselves.  My heart is humbled with deep gratitude 
<br/>at both, those who supported the effort known as Operation Tudei and those who voted for me.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge my beautiful wife, Kesa, and our sons and daughter, daughter-
<br/>in-law, my best son-in-law, Josefa, from Gau, who lives in Nadi, and our grandchildren.  I would like 
<br/>to thank my extended family and my very close family of my number one village in Sawani, Naitasiri.  
<br/>My sincere gratitude to Peter and Jill for their kindness and commitment.  To Jack and Rachel, thank 
<br/>you sincerely for your generosity. I deeply value and appreciate the contribution of Team Central, 
<br/>Team Taveuni, Team Qamea, Team Rewa and Team West.  I acknowledge those who have supported 
<br/>me financially, those who have supported me in prayer, the Churches and Church leaders who prayed 
<br/>and encouraged me - I am deeply humbled. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for having taken the Chair of this Parliament.  I have confidence 
<br/>that you will keep Parliament in order and lead us in establishing good decorum and protocol.  It goes 
<br/>without saying that the responsibility before you of keeping impartiality and ruling without fear or 
<br/>favour, is significant.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Parliament rests in the fear of God and in your capable 
<br/>hands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate the importance of our purpose in this Chambers that is to serve according to good 
<br/>conscience and moral  duty,  whether you are a member of the new Government or an Opposition 
<br/>Member, our purpose here is clear - it is to serve each and every Fijian.  I am reminded of a very 
<br/>simple yet significant leadership code that I want to share with everyone here today.  Robin Sharma 
<br/>reminds us that “To Lead is to Serve” and if we all put this to heart in everything that we do, then I 
<br/>have no doubt we can all take the country forward to achieve great things and most importantly give 
<br/>our people a better Fiji for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in concluding, I would like to say that our work 
<br/>as honourable Members of this august Parliament is about building the nation, labouring and making 
<br/>things better.  I want to, therefore, close and leave with us the words of the Psalmist from Psalm 
<br/>127:1-2, the Psalm that I have used as the beacon of my life, and it reads: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Unless the Lord builds the House; 
<br/>They labour in vain who build it;  
<br/>Unless the Lord guards the city; 
<br/>The watchman stays awake in vain.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may God bless you all and may God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank honourable Ioane Naivalurua for his Maiden Speech.  Honourable 
<br/>Members, we have now been informed as to who is the third member from the great province of 
<br/>Naitasiri in this Parliament – honourable Naivalurua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  adjourn  Parliament  for  morning  tea,  I  ask  the  Secretary-General  if  the  IT  people 
<br/></span><span>could be informed not to have a repeat of the glitch that we had, since the next speaker, the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar, has already given notice that he would like to speak in 
<br/>the Hindi language.

<br/>provides livelihood to thousands of people.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I start by paying my deepest respects to all our people, our land and the 
<br/>many cultures that we share; the elders of our past, present and those emerging, who have laid or will 
<br/>lay the future foundations of Fiji.  Without their pioneering sacrifices and efforts, none of us would 
<br/>have seen the prosperity and progress  nor experienced the freedoms and  the dignity  that we now 
<br/>rightfully demand and deserve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, allow me to thank our President, His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, for 
<br/>his most gracious address during the opening of this Parliament.  His Excellency is like a brother to 
<br/>me, and I repeat that His Excellency is like a brother to me, given our strong Macuata links and my 
<br/>intimate  associations  with  his  late  father  Ratu  Soso  Katonivere.    Ratu  Soso  Katonivere  was  a 
<br/>distinguished chief of extraordinary mana and stature and, of course, he was the NFP Senator and 
<br/>Member of Parliament, honourable Prasad reminded me on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me also put on record, the sense of widespread hurt, insult and anger felt by our people 
<br/>in all parts of Fiji, in the manner His Excellency the President was attacked by the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition.  It was totally uncalled for and unjustified.  It was deeply offensive, disrespectful, 
<br/>personal and even dangerously inciteful.  People from all over the country have expressed their strong 
<br/>condemnation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only has he demeaned himself personally, but also called into question 
<br/>the integrity of our Head of State.  His outburst should be unanimously condemned by this honourable 
<br/>Parliament.  We should never condone such contemptuous denigration of our century’s old traditions 
<br/>of parliamentary protocol, propriety and decency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me congratulate you and your Deputy on your election to these keys 
<br/>roles.  Given our </span><span>vanua</span><span> connections of Cakaudrove, you are also my high chief.  Let me assure you 
<br/>that your command shall always be my duty to fulfil, and my loyalty- your right to expect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, your sense of justice, dignity, humility, integrity, experience, knowledge 
<br/>and good judgement will no doubt usher in a fresh dose of fairness, tolerance, respect for each other 
<br/>and greater order of conduct of this august Parliament - something that has often been missing during 
<br/>many critical times in the last 16 years.  The example of your power, and the power of your example, 
<br/>shall be a continuing source of inspiration to all of us.  On a personal level, may I also point out that 
<br/>in you, I also have the privilege of a father.  Like many others, I have complete faith and trust in your 
<br/>wisdom and rely on you as a source of good counsel, guidance and advice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My late parents, Mr. and Mrs. Gurbachan Singh believed that it was the right and duty of 
<br/>every parent to discipline their children, as and when necessary.  That right, I gladly and respectfully 
<br/>confer upon you.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst I am a proud son of Fiji, I cannot hide my regional bias 
<br/>towards my island home - Vanua Levu.  In that respect, I wish to most sincerely thank the voters of 
<br/>this  Region  who  vested  their  confidence  and  trust  in  me  and  considered  me  worthy  of  their 
<br/>representation.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 91 percent of my votes came from North.  For that, I wish to thank you and 
<br/>I will always cherish the moment when you said at the rally of People’s Alliance Party in Labasa - 
<br/>“Do  not  vote  for  me,  vote  for  245  -  Charan  Jeath  Singh.”    And  those  words  have  landed  me  in 
<br/>Parliament – </span><span>vinaka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I also thank my </span><span>vanua,</span><span> my thousands of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> brothers and sisters, the chiefs, villagers, 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span>, my legion of devoted campaigners and supporters.  My victory belongs more to them than 
<br/>to me.  I shall always endeavour to reciprocate their trust.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency, our 
<br/>venerable  President  has  very  eloquently  outlined  the  priorities  and  policies  of  our  Coalition 
<br/>Government, of which I am a proud member.  His Excellency the President has rightfully alluded to 
<br/>many challenges and headwinds that lie ahead of our Government and our people, and the absolute 
<br/>need for the unity and cooperation of everyone if we are to tackle them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  childish  and  petty  refusal  by  the  honourable  Oppositions  to 
<br/>accept the verdict of our people, the nation takes great comfort and strength from the reassurance and 
<br/>endorsement of His Excellency the President in a democratic process, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I am grateful to note that the change in Government has taken place peacefully 
<br/>and swiftly and the new administration has commenced its work with the mandate of 
<br/>the people.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that mandate and popular support that His Excellency the President refers 
<br/>to,  is  the cornerstone of  true democracy.    Accordingly, there should be no doubt  in  the minds of 
<br/>anyone as to the legitimacy of our mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Power sharing between our three Parties may be a novelty for our country, but it is perfectly 
<br/>legal  and  constitutional.  Such  a  model  of  governance  and  power  sharing  is  the  most  appropriate 
<br/>prescription for our diverse nation and has been successfully tested in the United Kingdom, Australia, 
<br/>New Zealand, Italy, Israel and our island neighbours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  promotes  greater  consultation,  consensus,  tolerance  of  other’s  needs,  transparency, 
<br/>accountability, protection of the rights of the minority and ultimately, fosters greater cohesion and 
<br/>stronger pillars of our nationhood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not here just to warm our seats, Mr. Speaker, Sir, or to collect our pay and advance 
<br/>our own personal agenda of self-enrichment, power and privileges.  We are not here to scam the poor 
<br/>taxpayers through corruption, nepotism and promotion of sectoral policies that favour the minority 
<br/>at the expense of the poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High cost of living, unemployment, rampant corruption, low income and seriously collapsing 
<br/>health, housing, education, sanitation, water and road infrastructure, a near terminal sugar industry, 
<br/>all need our immediate attention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are starting just not from a zero base but from an abyss of unprecedented debts, years of 
<br/>chronic fiscal mismanagement and economic carnage of the last 16 years.  Undoubtedly, the entire 
<br/></span><span>Government apparatus was rotten to the core which was worsened by the populist policies that were 
<br/></span><span>adopted primarily to gain political capital.  Masking the true state of key sectors, such as the sugar 
<br/>industry, had become a norm.  Without a shadow of doubt, we were reaching the edge of the tipping 
<br/>point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  let  me  assure  our  fellow  citizens  that  we  will  be  very  forthright  and  work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strenuously and decisively to rebuild and bolster our socio-economic pillars.  Our approach is

<div><span>bottoms up and people-centered, and not bottom-down of model imposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are here to serve and not to be served.  We are here to be directed by people and not to 
<br/>dictate to them.  We are here to listen and learn, and not to lecture from the prism of arrogance and 
<br/>bigotry.  We will make sure of that, </span><span>Adhyaksha Mahoday</span><span> (Mr. Speaker, Sir). We will make sure that 
<br/>what I say, we will do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  conscious  decision  was  to  return  to  this  Parliament  after  23  years.  
<br/>Indeed, as I look around, I can say that I am the only Member of this Parliament who has previously 
<br/>been in Parliament with our current Prime Minister.  Both of us were in Parliament together between 
<br/>1994-1999, although on the different sides of the political aisle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together, with hundreds of thousands of our people of all ethnic communities - from the rural 
<br/>poor  and  urban  areas,  the  struggling  farmers,  the  workers,  the  middle  class  and  those  trapped  in 
<br/>poverty,  the  unemployed  and  those  lowly  paid  and  those  thousands  suffering  from  lack  of  basic 
<br/>health, housing, education, water and sanitation facilities, I have seen the wholesale betrayal in the 
<br/>last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  face  of  their  glaring  incompetence,  failures  and  reckless  mismanagement  of  the 
<br/>country, none of us could afford to sit on the sidelines and contribute to its immediate recovery and 
<br/>turnaround.  Our country and our people need to be rescued from this crisis and the carnage caused 
<br/>by that side of Parliament. The sheer magnitude and crippling nature of the challenge compels all of 
<br/>us to join hands and work in a unified, inclusive and forward-looking manner for the common good 
<br/>of our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adhyaksha Mahoday</span><span> (Mr. Speaker, Sir), I took as my foremost duty and moral responsibility. 
<br/>to offer my energy and resources to save this nation from drowning further in that fatal vortex of 
<br/>debts and distress inflicted by one man’s ignorance and obsessive sense of self-importance.  The pace 
<br/>at which our national debt was building up is certainly dreadful.  The past Government’s development 
<br/>model  was  an  utter  failure,  as  our  borrowing  was  employed  as  thy  main  driver  to  fuel  economic 
<br/>growth and fiscal stabilisation, which logically is not sustainable at all, burdening Fiji’s population 
<br/>to the current and the yet-to-be-born with loads of debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am thankful to our honourable Prime Minister for the faith and trust he 
<br/>has placed in me as his Minister for Sugar and Multi-Ethnic Affairs.  I may be the first Minister for 
<br/>Sugar who is an experienced cane farmer also, but I will not stop listening and learning from the 
<br/>12,000 cane farmers representing the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to give you the scale of degradation of this once glorious industry and our main economic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lifeline, let me share some key statistics: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Our cane production has declined by half from 3.2 million tonnes in 2006 to about 1.7 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million tonnes today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the last 14 years from 2006, the accumulated loss of FSC has been about half a billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of farmers has declined from 18,600 to about 12,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has lost its prominent economic position down to about 4 percent of the GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Under this sleeping Minister, it has been treated like an orphaned child and the exodus 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continues.

<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Under  his  watch,  the  key  institutions  of  the  industry,  such  as  the  Sugarcane  Growers 
<br/>Council and Sugar Commission have been dismantled without any consultations with any 
<br/>party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Our  milling  efficiencies,  farming  practices  and  incomes,  employee  welfare,  transport 
<br/>infrastructures, mill machinery all have run to the ground with a Sugar Minister who said 
<br/>as I said was sleeping on the job and was unaware of his responsibilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>His  glaring  incompetence  and  mismanagement  has  destroyed  a  once  beacon  of  our 
<br/>economy for 150 years to a pathetic unrecognisable shadow of its past.  The industry suffers 
<br/>from a massive loss of confidence, cloaked in a maze of lies and recklessness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This man, it is very important to know that the honourable Leader of the Opposition, in 
<br/>2009, had rejected the EU offer of $300 million only because he would not commit to a 
<br/>perfectly achievable timetable for holding democratic elections.  For him and his advisors, 
<br/>the continuation of his dictatorship was worth more than the large sum of money to help 
<br/>our farmers and the industry.

<div><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>All this happened  while the  senior  executives  treated themselves  with obscene  salaries, 
<br/>benefits and corrupt conflict of interests.  To all of them, the sleeping Minister had only one 
<br/>answer – ongoing investigations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are determined to restore the industry in the fullness of time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and with the cooperation and goodwill of the stakeholders.

<br/>of the Pacific.)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, </span><span>Adhyaksh Mahoday </span><span>(Mr. Speaker, Sir),</span><span> </span><span>I send my warm greetings and </span><span>shubh 
<br/>kamnayein</span><span> (best wishes) to all our people and assure them of our best efforts to govern in the interests 
<br/>of not just to serve a few, but all.  May our country and our people continue to be blessed forever.

<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and our fellow Fijians 
<br/>who are present here today and those who are actually watching the Parliamentary Session live; </span><span>bula</span><span>
<br/></span><span>vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to take a moment to thank the Almighty Lord for his guidance 
<br/>in allowing us to be here today to manage the affairs of our beloved Fiji.  Also, I want to take this 
<br/>opportunity  to  congratulate  you,  Sir,  on  your  appointment  as  Speaker  of  Parliament,  and  to  the 
<br/>Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture also, I want to acknowledge my father, the late Siddiq Moidin Koya, whose 
<br/>values  I  treasure  and  whose  teachings  and  principles  are  engrained  in  me,  as  I  continue  with  his 
<br/>legacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, also paying homage to the honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama for giving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me this opportunity and having faith in me to be part of the FijiFirst Team.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A special acknowledgement also, Mr. Speaker, to our former Speaker and former President, 
<br/>Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, for his years of dedicated service to Fiji and also as the outgoing Speaker. His 
<br/>service has been unwavering, and he is a shining example of impartiality and great service to our 
<br/>country as a true son of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  grateful  also  to  the  former  Attorney-General,  Mr.  Aiyaz  Sayed-Khaiyum,  and  other 
<br/>fellow colleagues of the FijiFirst Party for their continued confidence in me.  Last, but not least, I 
<br/>just  want  to  thank  my  friends  and  my  family  for  their  continuous  encouragement,  their  love  and 
<br/>support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over these last few days, much has been said about the state of Fiji and the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government,  but  for  those  who  have  stood  up  in  this  august  Parliament,  there  is  a  little 
<br/>reminder to all of you.  It is imperative, Sir, that we all speak the truth, as we have all taken an oath 
<br/>on our Holy books and our Constitution to serve our beloved country diligently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the honourable Prime Minister and the Coalition Government, it does not matter what you 
<br/>say and what you laugh at and what you may not laugh at, you actually ride on the success that was 
<br/>created at the last 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPP. MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- And whilst you do that in the time given to you by chance, be truthful 
<br/>and acknowledge what has been done. Every Fijian is watching you and us. Every Fijian is watching 
<br/>and waiting, Mr. Speaker, on what you will do, and how you will deliver on the promises that you 
<br/>have made. You must remember, it will our job as Parliament on behalf of the Fijian people, to keep 
<br/>you accountable, in the very same way that you used to tell us when we sat on that side of Parliament. 
<br/>Be prepared because we will make you accountable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  will  take  more  than  removing  people,  Mr.  Speaker,  removing  initiatives  of  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, relabelling, designing logos, to erase what the FijiFirst has built and done for the Fijian 
<br/>people.  So, as I stand before you today, Mr. Speaker, let me correct the record and speak about the 
<br/>tremendous success of the FijiFirst Government’s economic policies.  And let me just remind them 
<br/>- we had almost nine years of successive economic growth in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPP. MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That is a feat that cannot be overlooked, Mr. Speaker. Just a few months 
<br/>ago, Fiji was rated as the third fastest growing economy in the world. That is not a small feat.  That 
<br/>is not achieved willy-nilly and overnight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Fijian of Fiji has undergone a remarkable transformation and we give credit 
<br/>to the visionary leadership of the FijiFirst Government.  When FijiFirst came into power we inherited 
<br/>an economy that was struggling to recover from the impact of a corrupt system, one that was riddled 
<br/>with inequality that we have never let anything deter us from our vision of transforming Fiji into a 
<br/>diverse, modern and prosperous nation State, nor we will sit in on this side of the Parliament change 
<br/></span><span>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly, the FijiFirst Government has always put our people first and this is evident 
<br/>in  how  we  have  actually  combatted  the  challenges.    We  faced  and  recovered  as  a  nation  -  be  it 
<br/>devastating  cyclones,  devastating  global  events  and  global  financial  crisis,  and  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We set out an ambitious plan to boost economic growth and to create jobs and improve the 
<br/>standard of living of all Fijians, Mr. Speaker.  We focussed on developing infrastructure and human 
<br/>capital, both of which are essential ingredients for a progressive developing country.  You would 
<br/>have heard over the years that Fiji was punching way above its weight globally.  All these should be 
<br/>testament to the good work that was done.  We forget good stuff very easy, and we try and concentrate 
<br/>on the negative.  We are a small country, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key policies that the FijiFirst Government implemented was the creation of a stable 
<br/>and  predictable  business  environment.    That  has  been  achieved  through  a  range  of  measures, 
<br/>including  reducing  corporate  taxes  and  eliminating  unnecessary  regulations.    These  policies  have 
<br/>actually attracted both, local and international and foreign investors, which led to a surge in business 
<br/>activity and job creation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another critical aspect of the FijiFirst Government’s economic policy, Mr. Speaker, has been 
<br/>its focus on infrastructure development.  It is fine to come into this Chamber and say, ‘oh, you spent 
<br/>too much money’, but it was not wasted.  It has been put into our infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  invested  heavily  on  roads,  bridges,  ports,  airports,  in  addition  to  creating  jobs,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  It opened up new markets and opportunities for business.  We implemented policies that 
<br/>prioritised improving the quality of life for all Fijians by providing access to basic services, also such 
<br/>as water and electricity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  FijiFirst  was  in  Government,  the  commitment  to  education  and  training  was  also  a 
<br/>crucial factor in the country’s economic success.  The fruits of which, we are now actually losing to 
<br/>countries like Australia, New Zealand and the rest of the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We invested in schools, vocational training, tertiary education to ensure that Fijians have the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>skills and knowledge that they need to compete in the global economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We focused on the development of the tourism sector.  We implemented policies that became 
<br/>an example to  our regional  and our international  countries in  attracting tourists and changing  the 
<br/>overall visitor experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see now that honourable Gavoka has suddenly, yesterday in the press, pulled out some figure 
<br/>out of thin air about $12 million that ought to have gone to a particular part of the community.  I do 
<br/>not know where he gets those figures from.  He should back them up with some statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  of  those,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  resulted  in  significant  increasing  in  tourists  arrivals  and 
<br/>revenue, providing a significant boost to the economy.  I am not just saying this myself, Sir, this has 
<br/>been said by the two speakers before me - honourable Kamikamica and honourable Gavoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government’s economic policies have been nothing short of transformational.  
<br/>Fiji’s economy has grown rapidly and the standard of living for Fijians has improved significantly.  
<br/>When we sat on that side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, we showed that with the right policies and 
<br/>leadership,  an  island  nation  can  achieve  great  things.    Honourable  Members  on  the  other  side  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, it is now your turn.  Show us what you can do!  Do not talk the talk, walk the talk. The 
<br/></span><span>people of Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  want  to  know  what  you  are  actually  going  to  do.    We  do  not  want  to  hear  general 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statements and media grandstanding; we actually want to know about policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>187 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You have said that you want to diversify the economy, the question is, 
<br/>how will you do that? All that you are talking about in terms of diversification now, is that which 
<br/>was taken on board by us and started.  That is fine, that is fine! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Grow it, tell us how you are going to do it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is the change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You are actually making promises of all sorts, that is fine. But tell me, 
<br/>tell us all, tell the whole of Fiji - every single citizen anticipates your next move on delivering your 
<br/>promises through new policies, and not a delete and duplicate policy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Like what, give an example. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Open projects done by FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  I will get to you later. You promise change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Change is coming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Now, all we see is that, you are still campaigning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVT. MEMBER.- Pipeline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Is it campaigning to gain some kind of authenticity and validation by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>creating division?  That, my friend, if you remember … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What division? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- …you start creating divisions and to coin a phrase to the other side of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament that this creating of division for you, that is the only way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Example?. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is all your imagination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Not my imagination, speak to the people.  Honourable Members, let me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tell you, you are the Government.  You can stop campaigning now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- You’re campaigning! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Start governing! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, don’t campaign  now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You already and still are.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me give you an analogy, Mr. Speaker, and I know you will appreciate this, Sir.  You are 
<br/>actually in the driver’s seat, honourable Minister for Transport.  As Opposition, we will hold you to 
<br/>account for many promises that were made.  In 55 days out of the 100 - you only got 45 left, all you 
<br/>have managed to do is ask; where are the brakes, where is the fuel tank? When will you drive us 
<br/>forward? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Because it is actually evident that you are in reverse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Members, ‘r’ stands for ‘reverse’, not ‘relax’ and ‘rejoice’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do not be shy if you need to go back to driving school, come and ask us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  will  repeat,  you  are  actually  riding  on  a  whole  lot  of 
<br/>success that was created from this side of Parliament which  is fine, it is alright.  Governments change 
<br/>around the world all the time, there is a lot of continuity, but it is not happening from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Too much drama! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- What we want and what the people want are actual policies, the strong 
<br/>policies.    We  have  not  heard  nothing,  all  we  have  heard  is  bashing  that  is  going  on,  and  I  think 
<br/>honourable  Kamikamica  put  it  very  correctly.    He  came  into  this  Parliament  thinking  he  would 
<br/>improve the quality of debate, but he was not looking at us, he was looking at honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- He was.  He is not here but I wish he was, he was not looking at us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, Mr. Speaker, want a chance to critic what you have, to debate it, to discuss it just as you 
<br/>had the opportunity to throw us as much as you could from this side.  That is fine, that is Parliament.  
<br/>You made a 100-day promise, you have actually passed the halfway mark.  How much more time 
<br/>will you need to settle in - four years? What are your policies? Be specific!  Specific policies and 
<br/>your philosophies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your grandstanding, investigating, prosecuting, persecuting, are all that we have seen so far. 
<br/></span><span>Show us the governing, show us what you can do, the people of Fiji want to see.  You very proudly 
<br/>sit there, that is up to you, no problem, whichever way you got there.  But show us what you can do?  
<br/>But so far, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the inspiration that is being sought by that part of Parliament is actually 
<br/>coming out of desperation.  It is quite obvious, and remember, that ship never sails.  Get to the job 
<br/>of governing.  If you do not know how to, ask us, we will tell you.  Already, we can see that there 
<br/>are lots of struggles going on.

<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Like what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Their faces tell it all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Example? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You can see.  I look across this side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, and I 
<br/>see three honourable Ministers sitting there, where all three of them was run by one Ministry before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Remember, Mr. Speaker, literally one entire Ministry, there were four 
<br/>people running Civil Aviation and roughly just over 10, I think, it was for Tourism.  And now that 
<br/>has been turned into eight Ministry on its own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Because it is important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not about importance, it is about the quality of work that you get to 
<br/>run successfully.  Mind you, honourable Minister, that was grown into a $2 billion industry with that 
<br/>many people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The civil aviation industry in Fiji is a champion of the Region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- $2 billion debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Mr. Speaker, we got the job done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We got the job done.  Get the job done!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be amiss of me, Mr. Speaker, if I did not address some really serious issues, which 
<br/>are now coming to the floor - race-based divisive policies that now plaque us.  But before I do that, 
<br/>I want to thank also, Mr. Speaker, and you are actually part of this, those who have sat before all of 
<br/>us in these chairs, those who actually gave us the Fiji of today for better or for worse.  We must pay 
<br/>homage to those people who actually put us in this Parliament today, those who actually gave us eyes 
<br/>and greater sight into what to do and what not to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not want to be a fragile country anymore, Mr. Speaker.  Today, we are sitting on a 
<br/>platform that was built under the guidance of one of the greatest sons of Fiji, and that platform of 
<br/>equality, and that person commands the respect of the majority of the voting population.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROQO.- That is why we are here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We do not operate like you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We worked hard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It was his vision of a better Fiji for all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  lastly  before  I  take  my  seat,  I  wanted  to  raise  something  that  came  up 
<br/>yesterday which I find quite astounding.  Today, I am wearing a black tie, at the request of honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua yesterday.  She asked us to honour those who have been abused, Thursday we should 
<br/>wear black, and I did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, yesterday, the honourable Minister for Women did something that hurt most of the 
<br/>women in Fiji.  It is quite astounding that she could not, and she did not want to acknowledge the 
<br/>atrocities  that  were  committed  in  1987  against  some  of  our  women.    It  is  on  record,  honourable 
<br/>Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- A Point of order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not in a Maiden Speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Yes, I can in a Maiden Speech.  Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.    
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The Point of Order is misrepresentation….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hold on, let me speak to Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVT. MEMBERS.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Who is the Speaker? Listen to the Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.    Point of Order  on  misrepresentation  as 
<br/>well as imputing improper motive by the honourable Member when the response yesterday was to 
<br/>what was raised by another Member which is incorrect in Parliament of Reports from 1987. There 
<br/>were Reports from 2000, yes, under their leader who was a Commander.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- But 1987 the report so they are misrepresenting and attacking based 
<br/>on what I said yesterday which is only on what honourable Premila Kumar said was from 1987 and 
<br/>our leader. Specific timeframe - 1987. There were reports from 2000, yes, but not 1987 and he needs 
<br/>to be very clear about that before he proceeds because he is impugning that I was mentioning for all 
<br/>the situations that happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is what exactly what honourable Bulitavu raised earlier. There 
<br/>is a specific timeframe that was raised by honourable Premila Kumar which is 1987. That is what I 
<br/>am addressing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you may continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the honourable Minister has to do this is referring 
<br/>to 1987 is go and speak to Shamima Ali. She has made it publicly known the knowledge that she has 
<br/>with  respect  to  those  that  were  abused  in  1987  -  our  women  -  and  the  refusal  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Women to acknowledge even that fac, is a shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, if this was ……. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Point of Order. He is misrepresenting again.  The reports were from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2000 coup from that women’s groups and not 1987 he needs to be correct about that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  please  stick  to  the  issue  on  the  address  of  His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency the President and please continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Stick to the facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I think, Mr. Speaker, I have made my point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- In many jurisdictions, with a mistake like that you would get asked to 
<br/>resign as Minister. You are talking about women who got abused.  An example that was used was a 
<br/>10-year-old girl being abused.  That, Mr. Speaker, is what hurts.  Honourable Members on the other 
<br/>side, to us Fijian means every Fijian irrespective of where they are from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Now when we say Fijians we see them as God made us, not based on 
<br/>differences of race or religion.  Mr. Speaker, the FijiFirst Government changed a lot of things and 
<br/>we changed all of that.  Today we cannot go back to backward policies that have no place in todays’ 
<br/>modern Fiji.  It will only hamper economic development and we will not be able to tap into the full 
<br/>potential of our people because we neglect them.  We neglect to see them as God intended.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of things that this country needs to continue with, really think 
<br/>about it and put in the forefront of their mind.  It is really just highlighting the obvious. It is essential 
<br/>to understand that equality, stability and security are crucial for any country’s development regardless 
<br/>of  it  size  or  location.    These  three  factors  interrelated,  play  a  significant  role  ensuring  that  every 
<br/>citizen has access to the same opportunities regardless of background or ethnicity.  Stability refers to 
<br/>the political and social stability of a country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, your Government must promote policies that are based on merit. We created a 
<br/>meritocracy.    You  must  promote  polices  that  are  based  on  merit  and  not  ethnicity  and  cronies, 
<br/>ensuring that every citizen has equal access to education and job opportunities.  Government must 
<br/>work towards building a stable and securing environment which is essential for business to invest in 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen a slowdown already in terms of the investment climate in Fiji.  I keep an eye 
<br/>on it - I was the Minister responsible, so I do keep an eye on it.  We must also realise that Fiji is in a 
<br/>different place in a different space.  We are now part of a massive global community where Fiji has 
<br/>a front seat at the front table when it comes to climate change and when it comes to trade relations.  
<br/>Every international forum, we are now placed in a space that we have never been.  Make use of that, 
<br/>take advantage of that please and nurture it.  But that will only stay if there is continuity and stability 
<br/>where there is  rule of law.  Where there is a protection of human rights  and the strengthening of 
<br/>security apparatus to protect our citizens from external and internal threats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  equality,  stability  and  security  are  the  cornerstones  of  a  thriving 
<br/></span><span>society.  Fiji must work towards creating an environment where every citizen has equal opportunities 
<br/></span><span>and there is political and social stability.  I am sure we all understand that, where citizens feel secure 
<br/>- that is slowly (in our opinion) being eroded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope every member in this Parliament and every citizen in this country is 
<br/>listening and I reiterate that the voices of the 200,000 plus Fijian people who we stand here for, are 
<br/>going to be heard, but not only for them.  We are going to be heard with respect to all Fijians as we

<br/>and every member of this side of the Parliament gladly, willingly embrace our duty to keep all of you

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me extra time to deliver my response today. </span><span> Vinaka

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  TUICOLO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Members of Parliament, families and friends.  
<br/></span><span>Vina na cola </span><span>and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Holy Scriptures say, “In everything give thanks for this is the will of 
<br/>God” (I Thessalonians 5:18).  I am thankful Sir, to the Lord and creator of the universe for the breath 
<br/>of life and for His provision in giving me this opportunity to serve Him and the citizens of this country 
<br/>in this way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  I  must  genuinely  congratulate  the  new  Coalition  Government  for 
<br/>successfully and skilfully performed the tripartite marriage of convenience or the threefold union.  I 
<br/>hate to think about the threefold union described in the Scripture in Revelation 13, that is the union 
<br/>made up of the dragon, the beast and the false prophet.  Please, do not ask me to identify which one 
<br/>is  which  -  that  mystique  union  magically  ended  the  progressive  golden  age  rule  of  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government over these beautiful islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Sir, after the brief commendation, I must warn the current Government that it is 
<br/>not really a big deal because in normal marriage, there are only two parties.  Three parties in the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  spells  a  wonderful  recipe  for  disaster  and  doom  and  its  disintegration  is 
<br/>absolutely inevitable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to publicly thank the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and the FijiFirst leadership of the largest ever infrastructural development 
<br/>that this country has ever had.  The people of Navosa have asked me to thank the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Voreqe Bainimarama for the accessibility of electricity to almost every 
<br/>village, settlement and even isolated farmhouses.  The magnificent Navosa Subdivisional Hospital - 
<br/>it is not a wasted and useless spending of resources.  To the honourable Professor Biman Prasad – 
<br/>Navosa is not a tiny place like Dreketi in Vanua Levu.  It is much more sophisticated than you think. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- Your comment, honourable Member, shows a typical politician who 
<br/>is  out  of  touch  with  reality  and  shows  your  frustration  and  inability.  Your  attitude  shows  your 
<br/>frustration and lack of experience in dealing with challenges in running a modern State.    Lastly, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  the  recent  yet  to  be  opened  two-lane  super  highway  bridge  at  Namatewale  are  the 
<br/>highlights of FijiFirst period of infrastructural renaissance in which Navosa will be forever thankful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I also take this opportunity to thank all our voters who remain true and loyal to 
<br/>FijiFirst, - you are all appreciated. Not forgetting the hardworking youths and volunteers, my family 
<br/>and friends, lequ matavuwere from the Tikina of Noikoro of Navosa, the villages of Namarai and 
<br/>Malake  in  Ra,  Burelevu  in  Ra,  Nabukaluka  in  Naitasiri,  the  Banaban  community  and  families  in 
<br/>Savutalele,  Suvavou  Village,  families  in  Labasa,  Savusavu,  Lautoka,  Nadi  and  Sigatoka  and  not 
<br/>forgetting my uncle and Campaign Manager Mr. Ropate Labalabala, cousins Sera Raibe, Aporosa

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vucago, Nanise Makerebuka, </span><span>vinaka va’alevu taucoko na nomutou veitokoni</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  after  saying  all  that,  let  me  get  down  to  business  and  draw  attention  to  His 
<br/>Excellency the President’s Address by picking up and dwelling upon just two issues namely: the re-
<br/>establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs and the rights of the first people of this nation. I ask 
<br/>you  to  bear  with  me  as I  deliberate  on  the  above  issues  which  I  believe  a  foundational  pillars  of 
<br/>moving this country forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Great Council of Chiefs as we all know was set up by the British to assist 
<br/>them in indirectly ruling the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  In fact, it was not called the GCC when it was formed, it was 
<br/>called the Native Council. From the beginning it was part of a race base or the racist construct which 
<br/>the English had to help them govern the country in the divide and rule policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.-  Who wrote that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- So when the ultra-nationalists carried out two </span><span>coups</span><span> in 1987 … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- … the Chiefs in the GCC met their first test of national leadership of 
<br/>a multicultural country.  Mr. Speaker, those chiefs failed the test very badly, so badly that it led to 
<br/>that body being abolished by subsequent revolution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, instead of upholding the rule of law in 1987 under which all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> clans owned 
<br/>land and fishing rights, the GCC rushed to support, aid and abet the two 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span> which shook the 
<br/>first and last blows against the oak tree of the rule of law in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, those chiefs in the GCC in 1987 could be seen by all Fijian to be jubilant, merry-
<br/>making and carrying on in support of the 1987 </span><span>coups</span><span> which laid lasting damage to rule of law and 
<br/>governance of Fiji.  You have to remember the first Governor of Fiji, Sir Arthur Gordon, at one point 
<br/>was going to dissolve the Native Council because of drunkenness. Some chiefs came to the meeting 
<br/>drunk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  legitimate  question  to  ask  if  the  chiefs  in  the  GCC  trashed  their  own 
<br/>constitutional role under the 1970 and 1997 Constitution.  In the overall scheme of things, the Native 
<br/>Council was not very important to the British.  They themselves did not care for their foundations 
<br/>and existence, nor did they care for the welfare of Fijians, the national economy nor the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> clans 
<br/>and what we owned under the rule of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they directly attack on their own identity and national role again by setting up 
<br/>their own partisan political party the SVT.  They then elected the leader of the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span> to lead that 
<br/>party and in so doing the leadership election saw the defeat of a paramount chief Ro Lala Mara </span><span>Na 
<br/>Marama Na Roko Tui Dreketi</span><span>, who was the only other candidate for the role.  Mr. Speaker, that left 
<br/>a  bad  split  within  the  GCC  that  led  to  the  rise  of  three  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>political  parties  in  the  People’s 
<br/>Coalition - VLV (three seats from the East), PANU (four seats – Ba Province) and FAP with 11 seats 
<br/></span><span>with the rest of Viti Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the rules were changed so that the chiefs who did not support the SVT were not 
<br/>elected from the Provincial Councils to the GCC. The traditional head of Noikoro and titular head of 
<br/>Navosa, Adi Kuini Vuikaba Speed, was also barred from the GCC for some time… 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>195 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- ..due to this change in rules and the party politicisation of the GCC and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Provincial Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  TUICOLO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  she  later  overcame  those  rules  and  before  becoming 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister in 1999, she drafted policies for the GCC as a member from the Burebasaga 
<br/>rep to a three member GCC sub-committee.  Her policy recommendations were later adopted and 
<br/>implemented by her 2001 political opponent, the late Mr. Qarase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the leader of the then SVT is back as the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and Leader of PAP, Fijians will be keen to see if he has changed in how he wants the GCC to run 
<br/>when it reconvenes, as they say, in May this year, or whether he will resume in ensuring the GCC 
<br/>kills  itself again  by having  partisan party politics inside the GCC and in the Provincial Councils.  
<br/>Will this new leadership continue with its well guided secret agenda, the carefully cloaked ethnic 
<br/>politics to  gain  back  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  elitism,  power and  supremacy?  Sir, will it  be an independent  body 
<br/>advising the Government on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> issues with chiefs from various political colours, or will he stack 
<br/>it again to only endorse his political view?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  1999  Elections  having  defeated  the  SVT,  the  chiefs  in  support  of  the 
<br/>different point of view, were still in the minority in the stacked council with the majority showing 
<br/>their hands again after the 2000’s attempted </span><span>coup</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  the  body  tasked  with  the  sacred  task  of  helping  the  central 
<br/>government ensure social, economic and political progress for all Fijians and Fiji as a whole, took 
<br/>the side of unlawfulness, violence and racism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for all Fijians who want to know how much the 1987 and 2000 </span><span>coups</span><span> cost 
<br/>the Fijian economy as a whole, please, read Professor Narsey on this topic.  Fiji lost billions of dollars, 
<br/>one economist conservatively saying $20 billion from 1987 and 2000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  that  would  make  the  so  called  $10  billion  national  debt,  nothing.    After  all, 
<br/>Professor  Firth  of  Australian  National  University  once  wrote  that  by  1970,  Fiji’s  governance 
<br/>structures, the foundation of all economics, were far superior to the Asian tigers, which are Singapore, 
<br/>Malaysia, Thailand and other countries in Asia, which are all well ahead of Fiji today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 1987 and 2000 made Fijians poorer and poorer and its effects are still with 
<br/>us today because the Government is still paying off the NBF debts from the SVT Government.  Every 
<br/>government after the SVT Government had to find the funds for health, education, water, electricity, 
<br/>jobs, wages and other infrastructure because most of our resources is still paying off the effects of 
<br/>1987 and 2000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is not only legacy of the SVT, but very much a legacy of the GCC, which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gave moral authority to the 1987 and 2000 </span><span>coups</span><span>, the political violence and racism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for all those reasons which I have only summarised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>196 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here, I am one Fijian who is not looking forward to the return of the GCC under the same disastrous 
<br/>leadership and stewardship that killed it, and that which hacked the rule of law which protects all of 
<br/>our native lands and fisheries.  I know many Western chiefs and people agree because the GCC was 
<br/>also heavy with the Eastern and Central chiefs, while it is the Western lands and fisheries that have 
<br/>powered the national economy for decades.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Coalition Government thinks long and hard about bringing back 
<br/>the GCC and in what format.  I also hope that in the coming review and public consultations, many 
<br/>people will be more informed that the GCC has a very little use in the operation of the government 
<br/>of the day, but rather to be reserved for the </span><span>vanua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, being extinct for almost two decades without any remorse from the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>proves the fact that it is an unnecessary burden that will throw this country back to antiquity because 
<br/>what  existed before it killed itself made us all poorer and took  indigenous Fijians to  the brink of 
<br/>losing land and fisheries through the breakdown of the rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my second point is in regards to the rights of the people of this nation, and 
<br/>that  we  must  continue  to  recognise  the  rights  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  and  Rotumans  for  that  matter,  as 
<br/>guaranteed  in  international  agreements  like  the  International  Labour  Organization  Convention 
<br/>No.169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribunal People, as well as the United Nations Declaration 
<br/>on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of us are taking advantage of the UNDRIP for their own ambitious 
<br/>political  gain.    The  indigenous  experience  in  Fiji  and  that  of  other  countries  are  very  markedly 
<br/>different from other parts of the world, such as Australia, where the indigenous were not counted as 
<br/>human beings until the late 1960s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in 2008, the Australian Labour Party Government apologised to the indigenous 
<br/>Australians of the wrong past government committed.  The focus of the apology is about the stolen 
<br/>generation  where  100,000  children  were  taken  from  indigenous  mothers  under  the  assimilation 
<br/>policies throughout much of the 20</span><span>th</span><span> century.  Others had their land taken away from them arbitrarily 
<br/>and  their  cultural  practices  banned.  This  was  the  deprived  situation  that  the  UNDRIP  draws  its 
<br/>genesis from, and not from the indigenous Fijian experience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  rights  of  indigenous  people  in  Fiji  who  are  mainstreamed,  are  not  being 
<br/>infringed as the Constitution protects 91 percent of their land, their culture, custom and tradition, 
<br/>their access to the courts, their legal and political system (the very fact that the existence of the current 
<br/>Coalition Government testifies to this fact). Therefore, what we are saying is to use UNDRIP with 
<br/>care and not to politically trample on the right of others in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to  compensate for the above over-emphasis  and  exaggeration of the iTaukei 
<br/>imaginary plight by local propagandists, let me dwell briefly on the plight of the indentured labourers 
<br/>from the Indian sub-continent because in my view, we cannot do justice to the plight of the iTaukei 
<br/>without considering the </span><span>Girmitiya’s</span><span> saga and the missed opportunity for the iTaukei had, although 
<br/>not totally in their making.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, influenced by the notorious divided and rule British Colonial Policy and the 
<br/>desire to protect natives in Fijian villages to continue their cultural communal way of living intact, a 
<br/>separate government within the Fijian government was set up to administer natives separately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the building of the Fijian economy was to be the work of the labourers from 
<br/>thousands of miles in the Indian subcontinent while the iTaukei were living in paradise, enjoying 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>themselves, while the imported labourers were suffering through sweat, blood and tears in the cane 
<br/>fields akin to the Biblical story of the Israelites in Egypt and the Afro-Americans in the cotton field 
<br/>of the American colonies.  Mr. Speaker, their contribution must never be forgotten because without 
<br/>them, we might have waited a bit longer to attain nationhood. It was a blessing in disguise and an 
<br/>economic obstruction to those who were racially protected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Indo-Fijians  felt  they  were  consigned  to  a  second  class  citizen  State. 
<br/>Constitutional changes later gave them equal status and so the election of the Fiji Labour Party leader, 
<br/>Mr.  Mahendra  Chaudhary,  as  a  country’s  first  Indo-Fijian  Prime  Minister  in  1999.  It  is  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution  that  want  the  full  distance  and  cemented  that  equal  stature  by  calling  every  citizen 
<br/>‘Fijian’ as a common name. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPP. MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, on 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1879 the British Ship - </span><span>Leonidas</span><span>, landed in 
<br/>Levuka with the first batch of 463 indentured labourers. The journey lasted from 3</span><span>rd</span><span> March (Port of 
<br/>Calcutta) to 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1879.  Sea sickness must have taken its toll and none of these people had seen 
<br/>an ocean in their homeland. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the last ship, </span><span>S.S. Sutlej</span><span>, carrying 888 labourers arrived on 11</span><span>th</span><span> November, 1966.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some 42 ships made 87 voyages and carried 60,553 labourers destined to the colony of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, other painful saga of the </span><span>Girmitiyas -</span><span> distortion of the work agreement and the 
<br/>sinking of the ship, </span><span>Syria</span><span>, which left the Port of Calcutta on 13</span><span>th</span><span> March,1884 with 497 labourers. 
<br/>While only four miles from the Fijian shore, it hit the Nasilai Reef and sank on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1884, with 
<br/>the loss of 59 lives.  This maritime disaster sent shockwaves everywhere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the painful cries of the dying labourers still haunt the minds of their relatives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and friends.  Thanks to the indigenous Fijians, who attempted to help and save some lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there was huge protests in India regarding the inhumane cruelty being heaped 
<br/>on Indian labourers in Fiji.  They were treated like animals - beaten, poorly housed with meagre pay 
<br/>and long hours of work, poor medical facilities and poor educational arrangement for their children 
<br/>and  shortage  of  women  amongst  the  labourers  created  huge  social  problems.  Mr.  Speaker,  being 
<br/>confined like sardines on the ship led to the breaking of the caste system and the emergence of the 
<br/>Jahagi  Bhai  System.  Looking  at  this  daily  drama  unfolding  before  us,  perhaps  the  positive 
<br/>discrimination policy may also be on its way back favouring iTaukei. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that we will never forget the ‘slaves’ or the descendants of the initial 
<br/>builder of our economy, who are begging on our streets selling beans and peanuts, living in shanty 
<br/>houses and do not have things to fall back on to, and who are facing the risk of sickness and even 
<br/>premature death every minute of the day.  This is Christianity at its best. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a saying that goes, “the point of the pen is mightier than the point 
<br/>of a gun”.  Every time the point of the gun is used, the iTaukei race has to admit failure.  Stan Ritova 
<br/></span><span>and Eddie Dean so amply titled their post-</span><span>coup</span><span> book “</span><span>Rabuka No Other Way</span><span>” to publicly admit to 
<br/></span><span>the whole wide world that the way the iTaukei policy for being favourably treated was not working.  
<br/>Perhaps, it is time to review and minimise the institution, and let them learn the art of hard work and 
<br/>discipline life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the introduction of the gun culture in 1987, the iTaukei have suffered heavily.  A few 
<br/>of  their  high-ranking  chiefs  have  entered  the  Queen’s  Boarding  House.    The  unthinkable  has

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened where the chief hold the </span><span>mana</span><span> from heaven.  Where is the war club?  Where is the </span><span>moto 
<br/>bitu</span><span>? Where are the cannibals?  Where are the </span><span>Kalou Vu</span><span> and their </span><span>mana</span><span>?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer is that, they have vanished into thin air when the reality show of 
<br/>a democratic process sets in.  For too long, we have been hoodwinked and taken for a ride by our 
<br/>own leaders through traditionalism and what we call at Navosa, “</span><span>Na lawata ni Gauna” - </span><span>that we are 
<br/>a  special  breed  of  people,  that  we  are  one  of  the  lost tribes  of  Israel,  cult  leaders  springing  from 
<br/>everywhere.  This cultural propaganda is on the rise from unexpected spots around the country to 
<br/>divert the attention from the reality of the situation that requires hard work, dedication and discipline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei are given the impression that their economic survival depends 
<br/>largely on the removal of the migrant race from the nation’s political and economic life - an ironic 
<br/>echo of the Nazi’s demand for the expulsion of Jews from German life. If the Jews were gone, the 
<br/>German people would stop fighting each other and unite in a commonfolk community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei are bewitched by a sense of return to a traditional community 
<br/>of the identical fame German mystic ideology of blood and soil - </span><span>Noqu Kalou Noqu Vanua</span><span>.  For our 
<br/>progress and survival, this mentality must not be allowed to influence our public life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we are struggling as an iTaukei race… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- You are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- …not because of the migrant race but because we continue to cling to 
<br/>old ideas and myths. We want things to be the way they were.  Old ideas are our biggest liability, and 
<br/>they  are  liabilities  because  we  fail  to  realise  that  the  ideas  or  ways  of  doing  things  were  assets 
<br/>yesterday, but yesterday is gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to think beyond ethnicity.  Ethnic politics has no place in modern 
<br/>state for it creates division and economic chaos.  If our mindset and attitude do not change, then let 
<br/>us prepare for the worse scenario and political humiliation in the years to come.  If we are not serious 
<br/>about  understanding  and resolving the challenges and needs confronting  us, the threat  of a major 
<br/>structural erosion of one of the world’s finest and most colourful cultures become a real possibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  just  cannot  pick  up  the  pieces  and  move  on.    There  must  be  also  a 
<br/>paradigm shift which includes the qualities of our Parliamentary candidates and debates in the august 
<br/>Parliament.  But, again, Sir, the usual groundwork and the required discipline must begin from our 
<br/>family upbringing.  Thus, we are all included in a participatory programmer to prepare our children 
<br/>for the daunting task ahead of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  solution  for  the  iTaukei  plight  cannot  be  addressed  in  this 
<br/></span><span>Parliament alone.    I  am  a firm  believer in  quality  and broad-based education that starts  from  our 
<br/></span><span>individual homes, our community and faith-based organisations and then our educational institutions 
<br/>from elementary to tertiary level - an education that is balanced physically, socially, intellectually 
<br/>and spiritually that will produce an expected outcome of men, strong and disciplined. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  were  very  young,  our  parents  compelled  us  to 
<br/>memorise a gem from certain passage from the book of Education page 57, which I think would be

<br/>stand for the right  though  the heaven’s fall”.  That  is  the expected outcome we all desire for our 
<br/>children.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we must apologies for the couple of minutes delay 
<br/>in our resumption. At the same time, I would like to bring to your attention that certain speakers listed 
<br/>for this afternoon have been moved down simply because we have the Privileges Committee sitting 
<br/>and  we  hope  the  participation  to  the  debate  will  continue  with  the  rest  of  the  speakers  whilst 
<br/>honourable  Pio  Tikoduadua  and  honourable  Ratu  Rakuita  Vakalalabure  will  move  right  down 
<br/>towards the end.  In the meantime, I now call on the honourable Vijay Nath to deliver his speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>my  fellow  Fijians  that  are  joining  us  here  today in  the  gallery  and  all  of you  that  are  connecting 
<br/>online</span><span>, bula vinaka, Ram Ram, Salaam’alaykum and </span><span> good afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Address by His 
<br/>Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.  At the outset, I wish to thank all my voters who 
<br/>have believed in me, voted for me and voted FijiFirst back into Parliament. This has also enabled my 
<br/>presence  in  this  august  Parliament  today  and  I  wish  to  convey  my  sincere  thanks  to  all  FijiFirst 
<br/>supporters nationwide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge and thank my mum - Latchmi Nath for being 
<br/>the pillar of strength for me. In fact, she kept track of me every night. My Campaign Manager Kumar 
<br/>Sami, supporters - Mr. Goundar, my brother Sonu Vinay Nath,  Dharmen Singh, Farish, Muskesh 
<br/>Chand,  Bhan,  Sanjesh,  Navin,  my  tamana  Turaga  ni  Yavusa  o  Naboutini  Ratu  Timoci  for  his 
<br/>blessings.    Terennce  Ram  and  family,  brother  Jonny  and  family,  friends  and  families  from 
<br/>Namaqumaqua,  friends  and  families  from  Koroqaqa,  supporters  along  Baulevu  Road  in  Nausori, 
<br/>Nasi, Mainiweni, Sawani, Waituri, Vuci South, Vuci Road, Naselai, Vusuya and Koronivia. Ms. Ram 
<br/>Pati and family, Mohammed (Pop) of Momi and Mrs Singh family from Nasi. Ronald Kumar and 
<br/>team from Votualevu, Mr. Avinesh Pal and family from Caubati, my brothers from Australia and 
<br/>brother  Kevin  from  Canada.    I  thank  my  wife  and  my  daughter  Kaashvi  and  son  Krish  for  their 
<br/>support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I served under the FijiFirst Government as an Assistant Minister for the past 
<br/>eight years and it has been a great privilege to be given another opportunity to serve the people again.  
<br/>Serving the people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has always been a passion for me when I joined politics.  I was 
<br/>a social worker for more than 25 years before I joined politics and satisfying the needs of the people 
<br/>is something that I hold dear to my heart.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir I was brought up in the rural community of Koroqaqa at Bau Road in Naitasiri 
<br/>and  government  services  is  something  that  we  are  very  much  dependant  on,  such  as  rural 
<br/>development and assistances from Government.  One is accessing Government services and the other 
<br/>being part of the rural development programme.   This is the hallmark of FijiFirst Government which 
<br/>I  can  confidently  say,  has  done  so  much  for  our  rural  communities  than  any  other  Government 
<br/>combined  together  -  not  the  Alliance  Government,  not  the  Labour  Government,  not  the  SVT 
<br/>Government or the SDL Government but the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in responding to His Excellency the President’s speech, I will focus on areas 
<br/>which I have served in as Assistant Minister such as infrastructure development, rural and maritime 
<br/>development,  transport  and  disaster  management.      Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  been  very  strong 
<br/>emphasis on these mentioned areas by His Excellency on the plans by the Coalition Government, 
<br/>however, I would like to remind us all of a saying that action speaks louder than words.  I repeat it 
<br/>again - action speaks louder than words. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>201 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This also applies to those promises made during campaign time leading up to elections, yes, 
<br/>these promises are to be actioned and not only to be used for political mileage or vote buying and left 
<br/>as false promises.  I firmly, believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that whatever statement is delivered within this 
<br/>Chamber should be converted into action.  Putting word into action is something that the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  has  always  lived  up  to.    This  has  been  demonstrated  through  major  infrastructure 
<br/>developments that has touched the lives of all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure development rolled out by the FijiFirst Government has benefitted all Fijians, 
<br/>like never before. This has improved the livelihood of the people and no one was treated as a second 
<br/>or third class citizen.  Whether it was building a new access road to open up new economic and social 
<br/>opportunities for people;  whether it was pulling electricity line on an isolated community to have 
<br/>access to reliable power supply; whether it was pulling submarine water pipes from the mainland 
<br/>through the ocean to connect people on an island to safe and clean drinking water like Galoa Island, 
<br/>Malake Island and Moturiki - the FijiFirst Government went out of its way to ensure that all Fijians 
<br/>no matter where they were, were covered by infrastructure development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was only possible through a visionary leader like the FijiFirst Leader, who put people 
<br/>first and self later.  This was only possible through a government that thought strategically and acted 
<br/>in  the interest  of all people and not  only  in  the interest  of a particular province or community or 
<br/>oneself.  This was only possible through a government that served the people equally and not based 
<br/>on ethnicity, religion, provincial or social status.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In doing so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are aware and I believe many in this august Parliament 
<br/>have  seen  for  themselves  that  the  major  infrastructure  development  projects  implemented  by  the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  both  in  rural  and  urban  communities,  like  never  before.    These  include  the 
<br/>building of new roads, crossings, bridges, jetties and maintaining of old ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  the  FijiFirst  Government,  rural  road  network  reached  our  isolated  villages  and 
<br/>communities.  These villages and communities never thought that having access to roads will only 
<br/>be  a  lifetime  dream  or  a  myth.    Not  only  rural  road  development,  but  also  modernising  of  road 
<br/>network  around  our  urban  centres  and  main  highways,  for  example,  tarsealing  of  Nabouwalu  to 
<br/>Dreketi Highway, Sigatoka Valley Road and Moto Bridge and tarsealing there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent  replacement  of major crossing  along  Queens and Kings Highway has seen the 
<br/>completion  of  Bulu  Bridge  in  Nadroga,  Tavualevu  Bridge,  Korovou  Bridge  and  those  near 
<br/>completion like the Yaqara Bridge and the bridge in the highlands of Navosa.  Of course, now, the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  is  taking  credit  for  these  projects  such  as  the  bridge  in  Vanua  Levu  and 
<br/>Tavualevu,  which  was  opened  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  honourable  Minister.  
<br/>Unfortunately, they have canned the four lane roads between Lautoka and Nadi and the building of 
<br/>new highway from Suva to Nadi between Viti Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The move of the Coalition Government to bring back PWD is idiotic and shows lack of long 
<br/>term thinking.  The Coalition Government is only doing this for ego purposes.  The current set up by 
<br/>the FRA with works carried out by contractors was complemented by other key agencies such as the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  on  community  access  roads;  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Agriculture for farm access roads; the Ministry of Sugar and Fiji Sugar Corporation on cane access 
<br/></span><span>roads; the Ministry of Forestry on logging roads, was a very good one with an effective and modern 
<br/>set up, which our development partners and multilateral development also backed up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, there was even an allocation for non-FRA roads in the current budget 
<br/>to ensure that all roads were attended to in terms of maintenance and upgrading.  There is no need to 
<br/>bring back PWD.  Having said that, I wish to remind those on the other side of Parliament, you must

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work hard, work smarter, be strategic, always look to deliver services while using government funds 
<br/>wisely - think beyond your nose, think long term, please work smarter and do consider the most cost-
<br/>effective way as a better way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, much has been done as well by the FijiFirst Government in the improvement 
<br/>of water infrastructure nationwide.  Factors such as increasing population through rural to urban drift, 
<br/>expansion of urban and industrial areas and increasing development such as housing, has put pressure 
<br/>to our water infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Fiji National Development Plan, an ambitious target has been set and that is for Fijians 
<br/>to have access to safe and clean drinking water by 2030.  This has seen the implementation of major 
<br/>projects  such  as  modernising  water  and  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  extension  of  water 
<br/>distribution lines to cater for the huge demand of water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major projects that will forever be the legacy of FijiFirst Government is the Rewa 
<br/>River water supply project located in Viria, Naitasiri.  The completion of this project will end water 
<br/>woes in the Lami- Nausori corridor through the additional 40 million litres of water per day for the 
<br/>benefit of over 360,000 families and Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  implementation  of  such  project  is  an  indication  of  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government’s strategic planning and its ability to secure funds through negotiations which resulted 
<br/>in assistance from development partners and implementing this massive project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, rural water project is equally critical as most of our rural communities are 
<br/>not connected through the meter scheme and they have the standalone rural water scheme, as alluded 
<br/>to by His Excellency the President, this is another area that will be taken up by Public Works which 
<br/>will  be  a  duplication  of  work  currently  being  carried  out  by  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (WAF).  
<br/>Setting up of the rural water unit under the Public Works will be an expensive exercise as it does not 
<br/>only mean the need for resources but also the need to open Divisional and Sub-Divisional Offices in 
<br/>order to cover the whole of Fiji.  This again in itself is a waste of government funds and resources as 
<br/>currently, WAF was doing a good job in carrying out rural water projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an indication of the Coalition Government’s disconnection 
<br/>and lack of understanding, and how the current government mechanism works.  It is also not a well-
<br/>thought-out move which is evident of being another debacle by this Government.  Rural and maritime 
<br/>development programmes by the FijiFirst Government in the past years has transformed Fiji’s rural 
<br/>economy and have raised the Fijian living standard.  This is through assistance such as Self-Help 
<br/>Programmes  (SHP),  Non-Cane  Access  Roads  (NCAR),  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpath  and 
<br/>Foot Bridges (CARFF), Rural Housing Assistance Scheme (RHAS) and Emergency Water Supplies 
<br/>(EWS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And yes, Advisory Councils do play critical roles in connecting people to the government and 
<br/>vice versa to ensure that all people get the real assistance needed by them.  In this regard it is very 
<br/>important that the right people are appointed for the right position. People that can be a game changer 
<br/>and has the ability to serve the community as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is critical for an economy to have a robust transport system to enhance 
<br/>movement of goods and persons.  Our maritime community faces challenges particularly those that 
<br/>reside in the non-economical routes.  In addressing this, the FijiFirst Government has enhanced and 
<br/>modernised the Government Shipping Franchise Services.  This not only addressed the transportation 
<br/>issue but also encourage inter-island trade.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency has emphasised the need to better coordinate for disaster 
<br/>preparedness, response, recovery operations and mitigations.  Fiji’s Meteorological and Hydrological 
<br/>Services has forecast that in the 2022-2023 cyclone season, we would expect at least two tropical 
<br/>cyclone activities within Fiji’s area of responsibility.  Disaster preparedness is important, and I can 
<br/>say that the FijiFirst Government has made enormous strategies in improving the capacity of the Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Services in Nadi and in Laucala Bay to be disaster ready through the improvement 
<br/>of technology and internal processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  been  an  Assistant  Minister  for  Disaster  Management  for  the  past  three  years, 
<br/>coordination  is  very  critical  when  it  comes  to  disaster  preparedness  and  response.  The  Coalition 
<br/>Government has recently failed to deliver the services in flooding areas and the public is still waiting 
<br/>for the government assistance in Labasa and the Western Division.

<br/>voters who voted for FijiFirst candidates. I thank them from the bottom of my heart, and I thank them 
<br/>for believing in the FijiFirst policies that had benefitted them and all Fijians for the past eight years.  
<br/>I quote Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock of the United States Senate who said on his re-election, 
<br/>“A vote is a kind of prayer for the future you want for yourself and your children. Voting is faith put 
<br/>into action”.  I can only assure that all who voted for FijiFirst, there is a future that you want for you 
<br/>and your children will be our fight from this side of the Chamber.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must thank the current Government for seeing the light and continuing with those policies 
<br/></span><span>that had helped thousands of Fijians in the past eight years. The truth does really set us free.  I want 
<br/></span><span>to especially thank –

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my grandnephew – Penisoni, my one-man campaign team (Mr. Speaker, I quickly found 
<br/>out the disadvantage of having your children in the military or in the Police that when you 
<br/>stand for politics, they run away from you because they are political); and   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>My campaign team, my team at Delainabua and my golf team friends. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for your support during the campaign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I stand here humble and deeply honoured to be the first from my family to be 
<br/>elected to Parliament.  Both my parents have passed on and six of my 11 siblings.  I pay tribute to 
<br/>them, and to my  five older brothers who are still around, for their guidance and support for their 
<br/>youngest  in  the family.   I am  so blessed as  a 62-year-old  youngest  to  still have five of my  older 
<br/>siblings witness and celebrate this milestone day for our family with me, even though three of them 
<br/>are doing it from afar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My brother - Penisoni Gauna must be known to you, Mr. Speaker, because his favourite song 
<br/>is  </span><span>‘Biu  o  Somosomo  ni  ‘ida  na  mata‘a’</span><span>,  and  I  think  his  known  to  few  other  Members  in  this 
<br/>Parliament. He wrote a short piece on his </span><span>Facebook</span><span> Page a few days after our swearing in ceremony 
<br/>here in  this  Chamber, and I quote  a piece of what  he wrote that sums up very well our families’ 
<br/>feelings today.  He wrote, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Many of our friends and close acquaintances were sworn in as Member of Fiji’s 
<br/>new Parliament from both sides of the aisle and we were overjoyed.  But nothing brought 
<br/>more joy and happiness to us this Christmas than witnessing someone very close to us 
<br/>being sworn in as the first Member of Parliament from our faraway island of Vatoa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Mr.  Viliame  Naupoto,  I  speak  on  all  of  families’  behalf,  we  are 
<br/>humbled and proud of you, and we will defend you as long as we live.  There are things 
<br/>that transcend politics, and family is one of them. You are our brother and we love you.  
<br/>PG.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, my brother, I know that if it was any of my brothers standing here today instead of me, I 
<br/>would have written something very similar, but definitely not as eloquently put by my big brother.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was born and raised on that small faraway island that my brother mentioned.  Vatoa is close 
<br/>to Tonga than to Suva.  That small island as a small place in Fiji’s history, as it was discovered by 
<br/>Captain James Cook on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> July, 1774 and he named it, ‘Turtle Island’.  I think the landing of the 
<br/></span><span>HMS Resolution</span><span>, his ship, and a few crew members the next day would be the first recorded landing 
<br/>of the Europeans in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My father, Penisoni Naupoto, was a soldier towards the end of the II World War.  He was the 
<br/>first </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>in Vatoa and served in that capacity until his passing.  My late mother, Sofaia 
<br/>Matawalu, who is from Mabula in Cicia.  She is the most loving and kind-hearted person that I know.  
<br/>She is small in stature but yes, she has a big heart.  She, in addition to raising the 11 of us, also raised 
<br/>10 other children whose parents passed or those who were born out of wedlock.  At our home, we 
<br/>did not have the luxury of owning our own blanket.  When it was time to sleep, we would lie in a 
<br/></span><span>line and our mother would cover us with the big mat.  It was good fun. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  parents  were  very  devout  Christians.    They  raised  us  around  Christian  principles  and 
<br/>values.  My grandfather was the first to be a Methodist Minister from Vatoa in the early 1900s.  We 
<br/>were taught to be kind to all and we were not to speak ill of anyone, regardless of the circumstances.  
<br/></span><span>You break any of those two rules and you can guarantee that something else will break on you.  Those 
<br/></span><span>two rules sound simple enough but because of our human nature, it is so hard to follow to the latter.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, yes, our </span><span>sasa </span><span>broom played a different role quite often and those two rules remain the two 
<br/>main rules of my life.  Yes, at times more often than not, I still find myself breaking the rule, but now 
<br/>our </span><span>sasa </span><span>broom remains a broom but the guilt, when I realised that I have broken the rules, is more 
<br/>painful than the </span><span>sasa </span><span>broom changing role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some who were friends with me on </span><span>Facebook, </span><span>but now find that I have blocked or 
<br/>unfriend them.  It is because they had broken one or both of those two rules or tempting me to break 
<br/>them because of what they say or share.  I apologise if I have hurt your feelings in the process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am a Christian, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord of all my life and I would like to thank 
<br/>Reverend Ilaitia Tuwere, who is now the </span><span>Talatala Qase </span><span>at the Vatukarasa Church Division, for his 
<br/>spiritual  guidance  and  support  to  me  and  my  family  for  the  almost  six  years  of  my  tenure  as 
<br/>Commander RFMF, and helping me to grow spiritually. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mentioned my faith because my faith centres my life.  My faith, like my 
<br/>grandfather more than a century ago, are personal choices.  The word, “Christian” was thrown around 
<br/>during the campaign, some promising it to include it in the Constitution and to replace the current 
<br/>Secular State with the Christian State.  Secular State simply means, that the State is neutral when it 
<br/>comes to religion.  Our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and not freedom from religion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My humble view is that Christian is not the label of a nation, but it is a label that is attached 
<br/>to a person who confesses to be a Christian and practises the value of Christianity.  It is not labelling 
<br/>a nation Christian but living the Christian life that matters.  After all, Jesus himself said in Mathew 
<br/>5:16, “Let your light shine before others that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father 
<br/>in heaven”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  risk  Mr.  Speaker,  that  when  we  attach  religion  to  our  identity  as  a  nation,  it 
<br/>manifests into pride, and we look down upon those who may practise other religion or no religion at 
<br/>all.  My faith tells me that we are all equal in the eyes of God.  Discrimination of any form has no 
<br/>place in our beloved nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I turn to an issue that has saved and dominated my thinking for the past seven 
<br/>years up until today and, that is, the security situation in our beloved nation.  I hope that Government 
<br/>is doing their own security analysis and if anything, what I say next, they can match against their 
<br/>own analysis and refine their analysis and go forward from there, or they can even discard it, but I 
<br/>hope not before they listen to it first.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current situation in Fiji, in my view, can be best described as the proverbial calm before 
<br/>the storm,  and now the  storm  clouds are gathering. There  are very  clear indications now that the 
<br/>ingredients  that  came  together  and  ignited  into  the  chaos  of  2000  are  surfacing  again,  and  social 
<br/>media like never before, has been widely used as the vehicle to propagate conspiracy theories and 
<br/>misinformation that, in turn, is fuelling a lot of hatred amongst the general population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, social media is wreaking havoc amongst our people.  It is not only happening 
<br/>here in Fiji, but around the world as well.  The ingredients that came together in 2000 can be explained 
<br/></span><span>as a triangle that when the three sides come together, civil order erupts.  It is like the fire triangle of 
<br/></span><span>fuel, oxygen and heat.  When all three connect, fire occurs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The three sides of what I termed as the civil disorder triangle are: ethnonationalism or in our 
<br/>case </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> nationalism, religious nationalism and, again, in our case Christian nationalism and that 
<br/>the third side is hatred.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I hear the noble words and intention spoken in this Parliament from speakers 
<br/>before me,  advocating that  looking after  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> rights  does  not  mean overlooking  or demeaning 
<br/>others’ rights.  Those statements and sentiments I agree with wholeheartedly, and it should be the 
<br/>case here in Fiji.  But the reality, Mr. Speaker, learning from our history from 1987 onwards is that, 
<br/>the voter base usually read it differently.  They easily take it as an elevation of their status and it 
<br/>manifests into a push for supremacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fear that the concentration of and the fast-paced changes of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>institutions as announced 
<br/>by His Excellency and also by the Coalition Government and the rhetoric around </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> matters is 
<br/>creating that supremacy euphoria.  That is the first side of the triangle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  second  side  -  Christian  nationalism,  surfaced  very  quickly  in  the  2022 
<br/>Elections, compared to the 2018 Elections when I was watching it as Commander of RFMF.  Alarm 
<br/>bell  started  ringing  in  my  head  when  very  early  in  the  counting  process,  the  Methodist  Church 
<br/>published a letter signed by the </span><span>Qase Levu</span><span> on the so-called “glitch”, and it was very similar to the 
<br/>vein of the complaint from the heads of political parties other than the FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Christian nationalism can be broken down into two aspects; one the politicisation of religion 
<br/>and second, is the influence of religion on politics. In my view, both are happening.  Their visitations 
<br/>to Christian denominations by the honourable Prime Minister and very early after swearing in of the 
<br/>current Government, there was an announcement made that Chaplains were going to be posted back 
<br/>to school.  I do not say that as a criticism but just a matter of fact to point out what I am saying. This 
<br/>is the side of the triangle that usually legitimises the horrific acts committed in times of anarchy.  
<br/>“</span><span>Talatala</span><span> is here, I can whatever I can.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third side is hatred and is the easiest to prove.  A quick story - we were walking down 
<br/>the street with two of my honourable friends when a red car drove past and the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>lad in front 
<br/>of us leaned out and shouted, ‘</span><span>Aah! vacava, vacava?’</span><span> - challenging and taunting us.  But it is the 
<br/>social media that is fuelling hatred and here are some examples:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>‘Watch your mouth and pray that you will not be shipped away on the second Leonidas’  
<br/>‘It is simple, this is Fiji, you Indian.’  
<br/>This one is a swear word - ‘Indians, you are a disgrace to the Fijian name, go back to India 
<br/>on Leonidas boat’. 
<br/>This is in </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and if you do not understand </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, you might as well put on your 
<br/>headset for interpretation from the top.  This one is saying, “</span><span>Na kena dina ga mera moku 
<br/></span><span>na Qirimiti, me ra vakamatei yadudua, mera kila tu na vanua era tu kina.  Sa ra mai via 
<br/></span><span>kai Viti sara.  Tamata sa </span><span>(swear word), </span><span>ra luve ni kaidia </span><span>(swear word). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is happening on both sides (sorry), and I am just saying this to show that there is hatred down there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that given your long years of experience in Parliament, you will 
<br/>agree with me that the words we speak in this Chamber usually come back to haunt us and, yes, I am 
<br/>prepared to be haunted by the words that I have spoken here today.  Today, my guest in the gallery 
<br/>was supposed to be Ms. Jane Dau, but she is not here as she has moved across to Nadi and is supposed 
<br/>to be home from school now.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lady Jane, as I call her, is 11 years old, and I know that if she hears me, she will just shout 
<br/>out, “I will be 12 in August.”  This grandniece of mine from Cicia, her parents both related to me 
<br/>through my mum, is my most ardent and vocal supporter.  Jane will go around her neighbourhood 
<br/>and give out my number to those whom she meets with her simple message, “Please, vote for my 
<br/></span><span>tua.</span><span>”  Jane has no idea of the policies of the FijiFirst nor those of other parties but for her, the best 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>207 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policy was for people to vote for me, because I am her grandfather.  For Jane, with a very innocent 
<br/>mind of an 11-year-old, life is simple, ‘Please, vote for my </span><span>tua</span><span>”, because she knows and expects that 
<br/>her </span><span>tua</span><span> will do right for her.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why I have said the words that I have said in here as my Maiden Speech is because 
<br/>I want to reciprocate and do right for Jane, and I need your help.  And I know that if I do right for 
<br/>my Jane, I will also do right for your Jane or Joe, and the future generation who will take over this 
<br/>beloved nation from us.  The end state of my doing right for Jane is leaving behind a Fiji as a nation 
<br/>of opportunities and the only thing that matters is hard work, not race, not ethnicity, not gender, not 
<br/>religion, not the colour of her skin, not the province where she comes from and not even who her 
<br/>grandfather is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, building that Fiji starts here in this Chamber.  We must keep those sides of 
<br/>the civil disorder triangle apart, and we do that by being very mindful of the impact and the messages 
<br/>that we send to our voters through the changes that we make, through the policies and laws that we 
<br/>create and simply, through the words that we speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must put on hold changes that we know that will pull the sides of the triangle together.  
<br/>We must be brave and bold enough to reverse or cancel programmes and policies that divide us along 
<br/>ethnic lines. We must exercise and speak true love otherwise we just become noisy gongs or clanging 
<br/>symbols as the bible says.  When we keep the sides of the triangle apart and slowly dismantle them, 
<br/>we maintain stability.  Without which we as a nation will not prosper.  Let us do right for the future 
<br/>generation of our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  sit,  yesterday  I  held  back  and  did  not  utter  a  word  when  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation very loudly demanded that my 
<br/>honourable friend while delivering her speech shouting to provide evidence of rape that occurred in 
<br/>1987.  I was taken back because I thought that she would realise that in this Chamber everything is 
<br/>public - how dare she asked for evidence of rape in here when we take it to court, we try and keep it 
<br/>as private as possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It happened in 1987 and I remind her that it even happened in 2000 and its result of when the 
<br/>three sides of the triangle come together.  It happened in 2000 and to tell you a quick story, this lady 
<br/>was brave enough to tell the story an indo-Fijian lady, a mother and wife, thugs walking to her home.  
<br/>They asked her to strip naked, asked her to cook curry for them while they sat, drank beer and taunted 
<br/>her.  Now, if that makes you cringe then thousands of other people are cringing because they are 
<br/>watching this live on the television.  That is why I cringed yesterday when there was a strong demand 
<br/>from the lady Minister to provide evidence of rape.  Not in here, not in here definitely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said when the sides of the triangle come together there is civil disorder 
<br/>and usually, the women and children suffer most.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a new Member of Parliament, 
<br/>I look to you and to my senior colleagues for guidance and advice to quicken my learning of the rules 
<br/>and procedures of these Chambers and Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reaffirm my commitment to serve faithfully 
<br/>through my term as a Member of this Parliament.  I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery and those watching from the comforts

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  beginning  my  maiden  speech,  (politics  aside),  I  on  behalf  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Vanua</span><span> of </span><span>Ra</span><span> would like to join my colleagues the honourable Saukuru and the honourable Kiran to 
<br/>express my sincere condolences to the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> of </span><span>Vitogo</span><span> for the death of its high chief - </span><span>Na i Taukei

<br/></span><span>(May you depart in peace, Sir, Tui Vitogo). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I begin my maiden speech today with my favourite </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse taken from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the book of Jeremiah 29:11 which reads, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I know the plans I have for you, plans to bring you prosperity and not disaster, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plans to bring about the future you hope for.”

<br/>Gone i suka, Lo Dravo, Lo Dero, Lo Vara, Lebua, Lobu‘a, Lo Kuka and to the traditional 
<br/>makita  tree  totem  owners.    I  thank  God  Who  has  enabled  two  children  of  Ra  to  stand  in 
<br/>Parliament. The voice of Turukawa the legendary rooster of Nakauvadra shall resound once 
<br/>more.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To all my voters and for those who have not voted for me, I am now your representative. I 
<br/>cherish the trust that you have placed in me, and I will do my very best to represent your concerns 
<br/>and  work  towards  building  a  better  future  for  all  Fijians.    I  would  like  to  thank  some  of  my 
<br/>professional and very personal friends around Fiji and abroad (you know who you are) I will always 
<br/>be grateful for all their support and pray that they will always find favour in all that they do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  saved  my  last  thanks  to  those  most  dear  to  me  my  family.    I 
<br/>acknowledge  with  much  appreciation  the  continuous  support  of  my  late  mother,  Ilisapeci  Savua 
<br/>Niudamu. She had always been a pillar of strength to me and for that I will be forever grateful. I 
<br/>would also like to thank my father, Ratu Epeli Niudamu who is in the village watching television, 
<br/>and all my relatives at Matawailevu Village, Nalawa in Ra.  Also, a special thanks goes to the </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>na Ratu ni Bure, </span><span>Ratu Ilitomasi Busa, and villagers of Burenitu for their support for our Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  say  this  to  those  who  have  put  me  in  Parliament.  
<br/>Friends, my journey has just begun, and I can assure you that I have a responsibility to ensure that 
<br/>your voice is  heard and  I  am  and will always be interested in  what  you have to  say about  things 
<br/>concerning you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to respond in part to His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/>delivered  in  this  august  Parliament  on  Friday,  3</span><span>rd</span><span>  February,  2023.    I  congratulate  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka, and the Coalition Government Members, together 
<br/>with  all  the  honourable Members  of  Parliament,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  them  in  the 
<br/>betterment of our beloved nation and its people.  In doing so, we will be responding positively to the 
<br/>call by the Head of State, His Excellency the President, as he sees it and I wholeheartedly agree that 
<br/>the greatest challenge before us is working together to move our nation forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we have no other choice, but to learn and re-learn on how to work and 
<br/>live together in and outside Parliament.  The first step towards this end, in my view, is forgiveness.  
<br/>Unforgiveness is cancerous both, to the person and to the society as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given each of our faith background, honourable Members, we know that this is essential and 
<br/>is a basic tenet of all our faith.  Once forgiveness is sought and given, only then will real and genuine 
<br/></span><span>restoration  and  a  process  of  working  together  could  be  carried  out.    If  we  choose  otherwise  this 
<br/></span><span>bondage of unforgiveness will surely be a barrier to our work in Parliament.  I pray that God will 
<br/>grant us the wisdom and strength to forgive people who have wronged us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that both parties of this august Parliament put their differences 
<br/>aside and provide a platform that will provide policies which are conducive to infrastructural and 
<br/>human resources development and continue from the development that has been carried out by the

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>previous  Government.    In  His  Excellency’s  Address,  the  President  has  emphasised  that  we  must 
<br/>continue to improve on our infrastructure to meet the demands of a modern Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel that in our quest for modernisation and globalisation, we should also 
<br/>strive to uphold time-tested values and principles that have not only made life in Fiji meaningful and 
<br/>desirable, but also set us apart from life experiences of bigger and modern countries.  Over time and 
<br/>against all odds, to some degree, we have maintained our sense of family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that both, individually and corporately, and at all levels of society 
<br/>including us, honourable Members, we will need to work together in the maze of this vision, if you 
<br/>allow.  Fortunately, we are not starting anew, all that we need to do is to build on the work of the past 
<br/>years towards this end.  After all, four years is not long, and in no time, it will be election time once 
<br/>again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The intent of the reforms is to continue to improve the lives of ordinary Fijians and better 
<br/>equip our young people for satisfying roles and responsibilities in a vibrant, growing and thriving 
<br/>economy.   Honourable Members, this is our time, this is our season, and we all need to rise above 
<br/>all our differences and barriers to move the nation forward and establish our mark in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ra was one of the neglected province in Fiji where not much attention was 
<br/>given.    However,  being  a  </span><span>kai  colo  </span><span>from  the  interior  of  Ra,  we  are  thankful  to  the  previous 
<br/>Bainimarama-led Government for the immense development done in my home province, particularly 
<br/>with the improved road access and electricity.   Sir, this is one of the reasons I was inspired to join 
<br/>the FijiFirst Movement for the sterling work they have contributed to nation building for the past 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring to the bring to the attention of the current 
<br/>Government some of the ongoing infrastructural  developments which was initiated by the former 
<br/>Government, which they have now inherited which I request to be looked at immediately, and are as 
<br/>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The township of Waimicia in Nalawa has a very serious water problem which has hindered 
<br/>development in that area.  Waimicia is where the Nalawa Police Station is located, together 
<br/>with the Waimaro Health Centre, the shopping centres, together with four schools.  This 
<br/>should not be the case, as we have a good water source at Nasavusavu which can meet the 
<br/>needs of the villages between Navesau Adventist High School to Madhuvani Settlement 
<br/>along the King’s Road.  I understand that this had already been surveyed by the previous 
<br/>Government  and  ready  for  implementation  once  the  funds  are  available,  but  this  is  a 
<br/>problem and should be given top priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the coastal side of Nakorotubu and interior of Ra, the people are very grateful for the 
<br/>installation of powerlines and meter boxes at their very doorstep.  They are just waiting for 
<br/>the wiring of their homes so that they can have access to EFL power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The construction of the new Nalawa Police Station which the previous Government had 
<br/></span><span>already  budgeted  for.    We  are  still  waiting  for  that  be  done  by  the  new  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  now,  the  Coalition  Government  is  running  the  nation  and  it  is 
<br/>understandable that you cannot do everything at once, you have to plan for it, budget for it and then 
<br/>implement it, as we the kai Ra usually say, “Rome was not built in one day”.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>211 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst  has  commenced  with  the  infrastructural  development,  and  we  ask  the  current 
<br/>Government to build on it.   While we may be called “the Opposition” for historical reasons, we stand 
<br/>here not necessarily to oppose, but to work with parliamentary colleagues, along and across the aisle, 
<br/>to refine existing policies and propose new approaches to the challenges we face as a nation.  Fiji’s 
<br/>economic, social and security challenges have grown more complex over the years.  Policy responses 
<br/>must rise to the challenge and to  do so, we need earnest  and robust discussions on substantiative 
<br/>policy matters both, in and out of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Government is looking at the possibility of setting up 
<br/>cane juice extraction facility at the old Penang Mill site in Rakiraki.  I also urge the Government 
<br/>under the Ministry of Sugar, together with FSC and iTaukei Land Trust Board and other stakeholders, 
<br/>in  encouraging  and  assisting  many  farmers  in  Ra  in  doing  cane  farming,  particularly  our  </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>families.  The Government has to provide many incentives and subsidies to encourage cane planting, 
<br/>just like what the FijiFirst has done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I end by once again re-affirming my pledge to serve our beloved nation, 
<br/>Fiji, and all its people to the best of my ability.  I, therefore, look forward  to making meaningful 
<br/>contributions in this august Parliament in the next four years.  It is my hope and prayer that God will 
<br/>continue to bless our beloved Fiji and all of its citizens now and forever more.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians who are present 
<br/>here today and those who are connecting via livestream;  I am  deeply  honoured and privileged to 
<br/>stand in this august Parliament and to deliver my Maiden Speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to also make a few contributions on His Excellency the President’s 
<br/>gracious Address.  I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your appointment as Speaker of this 
<br/>august  Parliament,  as  well  as  the  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Lenora  Qereqeretabua.  
<br/>Furthermore, Sir, I would like to personally thank you for your foresight in encouraging me to stand 
<br/>in the 2022 General Elections, when we used to have </span><span>yaqona</span><span> at your house in Lami.  I wish you well 
<br/>in your tenure as Speaker of this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Prime Minister for trusting me to become a 
<br/>Member of Parliament under the People’s Alliance Party, as well as an important responsibility of 
<br/>being  an  Assistant  Minister  in  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office.    I  also  congratulate  the  honourable 
<br/>Members on both sides of Parliament for winning their seats at the 14</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022 Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious and well-
<br/>articulated Address.  His message was clear and assured us that we must remain united for the sake 
<br/>of  our  beloved  nation.    His  Excellency  the  President’s  Address  also  clearly  outline  the  People’s 
<br/>Coalition  Government’s  mission  and  vision,  key  policies  and  programmes  and  initiatives  of 
<br/></span><span>Government and its legislative agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  allow  me  to  make  a  few  observations  on  the  proceedings  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, especially, the antics of the honourable Opposition and 
<br/>a vile and revisionist speech of their Leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend you for your patience and wisdom in allowing the proceedings,

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>despite the toxic and poisonous reply by the honourable Leader of the Opposition to His excellency 
<br/>the President’s Address.  As a fledging Member of Parliament and still awaiting to give my Maiden 
<br/>Speech, my expectation then was the summoning of the Chair by the Sergeant-at-Arms to eject the 
<br/>transgressor of Parliament rules and orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition was allowed to carry on and duly 
<br/>proceeded to reveal himself to this august Parliament, to the nation, to the world, and the rest as they 
<br/>say is history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I saw two heroes emerge from this whole episode.  The first is your good-
<br/>self, Sir, for allowing the honourable Leader of Opposition to complete his misguided contribution 
<br/>to the current debate.  As we learnt from the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the other hero 
<br/>emerging was His Excellency the President himself, </span><span>the Turaga Tui Macuata</span><span> and </span><span>Taukei Bilatagane</span><span>, 
<br/>a  paramount  chief  of  the  highest  class  and  quality,  steadfast  and  resilient  in  the  face  of  political 
<br/>pressure and adversity, a national leader who, in his final analysis, chose to stand for Fiji and the 
<br/>greater good of the country and all Fijians.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for your indulgence, let me 
<br/>tell my story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I joined politics at the request of my chief in my village, </span><span>Turaga na Tui 
<br/>Suva</span><span>, Sanaila Mudunavosa, and my supporters in the Melanesian communities around Fiji.  I was a 
<br/>bit hesitant at first, but then I made up my mind to stand if I have the support of the </span><span>vanua</span><span>.  To be 
<br/>honest, my decision to join politics came with some sacrifice for me and my family.  However, the 
<br/>thought  of  my  children,  grandchildren  and  descendants,  having  to  bear  the  consequences  of  our 
<br/>decisions, fuelled my zeal to contribute to building a better Fiji for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Being  a  novice  politician,  my  campaign  was  not  an  easy  one.    I  faced  an  uphill  battle  to 
<br/>destabilise the juggernaut power and money of the FijiFirst Government.  To change the mindset of 
<br/>our people was difficult.  They were used to the FijiFirst propaganda, and it was an uphill battle.  In 
<br/>the fight, it was a mismatch, it was David against Goliath.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this did not dampen my resolve to continue and encourage our people to 
<br/>press on, regardless.  I was reminded by the words of the former Fiji Rugby Coach, Brad Johnston, 
<br/>when asked after Fiji losing the Fiji-England World Cup Rugby match of how he compared Fiji to 
<br/>England.  He said, “It was like comparing Mercedes to roller skates.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were, indeed, on roller skates.  We were outmuscled by the ferocity of 
<br/>the FijiFirst tsunami campaign.  The money that was poured around by the FijiFirst Government to 
<br/>buy the votes was unbelievable.  Someone called on Tuesday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022, and said that a 
<br/>Government vehicle was still delivering pots to ladies groups in the Central Division, when Elections 
<br/>were being held the next day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- What were they trying to prove? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the fact. Even though I am registered in the </span><span>Vola 
<br/>ni Kawa Bula</span><span> from Suvavou Village, I am also part Solomon. My grandmother is a Solomon Islander.  
<br/>My father was  brought  up by the Solomon Islanders at  Wailoku when his dad passed away even 
<br/>before when he was born.  I grew up in Wailoku and attended the St. John Anglican Primary School.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When is the public reunion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- I am currently the manager of St. Johns Anglican Primary School and 
<br/>also the President of the St. Johns Anglican Old Scholars Association.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned 
<br/>by honourable Bia yesterday the Solomon Islanders and Melanesian communities faced formidable 
<br/>constraints in their socio-economic development, I certainly agree with him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the adoption of the 2013 Constitution, these communities had been 
<br/>totally forgotten.  This had led to destitute and increase in poverty with the lack of opportunities for 
<br/>employment.    Some  houses  in  these  communities  do  not  have  proper  toilets  -  this  is  totally 
<br/>unacceptable.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  agree  with  honourable  Bia’s  comments  that 
<br/>providing everyone with the same equal rights will benefit the Melanesian communities, this is far 
<br/>from the truth. An equal playing field for everyone has drastically eroded the social, as well as the 
<br/>economic rights that was previously enjoyed by the Melanesian communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I was campaigning around the Navua area, Melanesians residing in 
<br/>these areas informed me that the system is not serving any purpose. They said, the assistance from 
<br/>the then government would only reach the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> neighbours as they watched from the sidelines.  
<br/>As government assistance mostly targeted </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government will pave the way for the Melanesian 
<br/>community.  Gone are the days when our Melanesian communities would watch from the sidelines.  
<br/>To all my Melanesian brothers and sisters, I confidentially say to you this Government sees you, this 
<br/>Government hears you and this Government is here for you.  The People’s Coalition Government is 
<br/>committed  to  enhancing  the  social  and  economic  conditions  of  Melanesian  descendants, 
<br/>reintroducing  the  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  to  be  responsible  for  the  development  of 
<br/>Melanesian communities as well as other minority communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  answer  to  addressing  the  plight  of  Melanesians  in  Fiji  is  simply  to 
<br/>recognise their true identity as Melanesian the descendants of Solomon Islanders whether they are 
<br/>from Papua New Guinea or Vanuatu.  We have to treat them differently as they are the most poverty-
<br/>stricken communities in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me thank some of my supporters who contributed significantly to my 
<br/>campaign. I would like to thank the people of Wailoku for their unwavering support.  I would like to 
<br/>thank the villages of Koio, Marata, Bali, Wai and Korolailai.  I wish to thank Kevueli Bogi, Potter, 
<br/>Alipate  Kaka,  Sani  Dauni,  Akuila  Talemaitoga,  Jone  Baleikadavu,  Jone  Logabou,  Jo  Makaunia, 
<br/>Saimoni Iroi, Jone Kiko and a few others who I have failed to mention.  I am so grateful indeed for 
<br/>your support.  I also wish to thank the people of Matata Settlement for their trust and belief in me 
<br/>especially Mr. Jone Peni and Are Maori for always supporting me in my campaign and their role in 
<br/>influencing the community.  </span><span>Vinaka Vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me also to thank the other Melanesian community around Fiji for 
<br/>putting their trust in me by voting me in the last general election.  This included New Town, Caubati, 
<br/>Kalekana,  Muanikoso,  Laqere,  Naviavia,  Naganivatu,  Nabunikadamu,  Nadawa  in  Ovalau  and 
<br/></span><span>Wailailai.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also raise my hands to be the voice of my people in the greater Lami 
<br/></span><span>area. I will make sure their plight and cries are heard and actions taken to address their issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be remiss of me not to mention the person who really influenced 
<br/>my life.  He is my dad, Mr. Sakiusa Tubuna (Senior), who grew up amongst the Solomon Islanders 
<br/>in Wailoku.  Growing up from a poor family and over 30 years served as a primary and secondary 
<br/>school teacher, he later served as Director of Fiji Centre at University of the South Pacific (USP).

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Dad is an avid gardener and at 81 years old, he still plants his own cassava. My mum, Karaliani 
<br/>Tubuna, hails from Namuana Village in Tavuki, Kadavu, and served as a nurse for over 30 years in 
<br/>hospitals around Fiji.  I am glad that they are in good health and are able to join us at the public 
<br/>gallery this afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two people that I also wish to mention who have had an impact on my life.  They 
<br/>were  my  maternal  uncle,  the  late  Mr.  Solomoni  Momoivalu,  the  former  Minister  in  the  Alliance 
<br/>Government and my late father-in-law, Mr. Militoni Leweniqila.  They were seasoned politicians 
<br/>who influenced my thinking and developed my interest in politics. I am also indebted to the late Ratu 
<br/>Sir Kamisese Mara who, in his foresight initiated the Fijian Affairs Scholarship. This allowed me to 
<br/>pursue a Bachelor of Agricultural Economics Degree at the Australian University of New England 
<br/>in the mid-1980s after leaving Ratu Kadavulevu School.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government debt was a major issue and this was an issue that was raised with us when we 
<br/>were campaigning.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the campaign I shared with those that I visited of how 
<br/>I  always  admired  the  calibre  of  great  leaders  such  as  Ratu  Sir  Kamisese  Mara  and  former  Prime 
<br/>Minister  Laisenia  Qarase.    From  Ratu  Kamisese  Mara’s  time  to  Mr.  Qarase’s  time  there  were 
<br/>significant developments made in Fiji namely the Seaqaqa Sugar Cane Project, Monasavu Hydro, 
<br/>Fiji Pine Scheme and the Suva-Nadi Highway amongst many others.  Most of these projects were 
<br/>loans from international financing institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2006 after the takeover of the Qarase Government, Fiji’s external debt 
<br/>grew significantly to $10 billion.   People were asking where this $10billion was.  We have not seen 
<br/>any new highway, no new major agriculture development projects and no new hydro facility. Where 
<br/>has all the money gone to? This showed the gross incompetence and mismanagement of public funds 
<br/>by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to be here this afternoon as the first person from my village in 
<br/>Suvavou, the traditional owners of the Suva Peninsula to be elected a Member of Parliament. I am 
<br/>forever grateful to the Turaga na Tui Suva, Mr. Sanaila Mudunavosa, head of the three Yavusa of 
<br/>Nauluvatu, Nayavumata and Vatuwaqa and the 11 </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> for having their faith in me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to especially thank my team in the village - Nau Tuni, tavale Semesa, tavale Jo Navara 
<br/>and Nau Veresa. I promised you that I will do my best to serve you in four years in Parliament.   I 
<br/>wish  to  thank  my  wife  and  children,  Sainiana,  Isireli  and  Sakiusa.  They  have  been  my  tower  of 
<br/>strength and have continued to inspire me to reach this far.  I also remember my eldest daughter who 
<br/>was tragically killed in a road accident three years ago. Her name is Kara and she would have been 
<br/>very proud if she was here today. May she rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must acknowledge my campaign team for doing a tremendous job.  My campaign manager 
<br/>Master. Maleli Siata toiled hard day and night to ensure that we achieved our weekly targets. Vinaka 
<br/>Vakalevu Mr. Male. I would like to thank other members of the team namely; Esita, Iraia, Mereseini 
<br/>Mocelutu, Josua Karavaki, Kinisimere Raiba, Elizabeth Tuicaucau and Moape Malumuiri.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  also  thank  the  following  communities  for  their  support, 
<br/>Kauvula/Kaudamu Road at Delainavesi, Motusa Church Community, Sogowaluvu, Tauluga, Veisari, 
<br/>Delainavesi, Qauia and Lami.  A special mention of Mr. Viliame Rauca, Alivia Boto and Joji from

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  members  of  my  Church,  St.  Gabriel  Anglican 
<br/>Church at Laqere, for their prayers and continuing support.  I wish to thank our padre Fr. Peniasi 
<br/>Lomayasi for his spiritual guidance.  I wish to also acknowledge my siblings; Jone, Marama and Sale 
<br/>for  their  financial  and  moral  support.    Since  forming  the  People’s  Coalition  Government,  I  have 
<br/>accompanied the honourable Prime Minister on his tours to some of the rural areas particularly in 
<br/>Vanua Levu.  Most of the villages that I visited had not  witnessed any development  and had not 
<br/>progressed to the standard that is expected.  Some still lack reliable water supply, have no access to 
<br/>electricity and lack basic infrastructure such as community halls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my view, the living standards of our rural people have fallen to basic level, a legacy of the 
<br/>past 16 years of mismanagement of public funds and the unequal of Government resources to rural 
<br/>and maritime areas.  Even Government agencies such as FRA has totally neglected the constructed 
<br/>and upgrading of roads in the rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the biggest victim of the 16 years in power of the FijiFirst Government are 
<br/>the Fijians registered in the </span><span>Vola ni Kawa Bula.  </span><span>They are the third-class citizens of this country.  
<br/>This morning we heard the honourable Faiyaz Koya boasting about the economic performance of the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government.  The FijiFirst Government in 2016 formulated a 20-year National Development 
<br/>Plan (NDP).  Yesterday, I was just looking at some of the targets set by the Government and there 
<br/>are two examples that I wish to highlight.  The annual average growth rate target of 4.5 percent from 
<br/>2016-2021, where -1.8 percent was achieved.  The government debt to reduce it to 35 percent, the 
<br/>actual Government debt now is more than 85 percent.  His figures again revealed the poor economic 
<br/>management of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my role as Assistant Minister, I would like to see if there is a greater resource 
<br/>mobilisation  of  environmental  funds  provided  by  donor  agencies  such  as  Global  Environment 
<br/>Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to specific areas to ensure its sustainability.  There 
<br/>are a lot of projects in the past which are often disintegrated and not properly coordinated to achieve 
<br/>any positive environmental and economic return. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President  in  his  speech,  refers  to  our  resilience  as  a 
<br/>return when we are tested with the advent of global pandemic and natural disasters.  Our resilience 
<br/>as a community is based around our village community settings.  In my 30 years of working in rural 
<br/>and agricultural developments in both Fiji and with the United Nations, I firmly believe any hope of 
<br/>rejuvenating the economy has to start from the village and local community.  We desperately need 
<br/>to enhance the governance of our local village institutions so that they are able to actively plan the 
<br/>community development efforts to ensure better social cohesion.  Thus, this will be supplemented by 
<br/>identifying livelihood opportunities for people in the villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of 
<br/>this  Parliament,  I  thank  you.    Based  on  these  remarks,  I  commend  the  motion  to  the  Parliament.  
<br/></span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn the Parliament for tea before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we resume with the debates.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>217 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Elections are a testament to the strength of our democracy, and 
<br/>I am honoured to have had the opportunity to be a part of this historic moment.  Indeed, the Election 
<br/>process  is  a  challenging  and  often  drooling  one  but  is  also  a  testament  to  the  resilience  and 
<br/>determination  of  our  people,  who  are  committed  to  building  a  better  future  for  ourselves  and  for 
<br/>future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to be one of the 26 FijiFirst MPs in Parliament.  FijiFirst has 
<br/>the biggest number of Members in this Parliament after having won 26 seats out of the 55 seats in 
<br/>the 2022 General Election.  FijiFirst received 200,246 votes, which is 42.55 percent of the total votes 
<br/>casted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am  grateful to  have had the chance to  meet  so  many of our fellow Fijians, to  hear their 
<br/>stories and to understand their concerns.  Their input has been invaluable in shaping our platform, 
<br/>and we will continue to listen to their needs and concerns as we take on the responsibilities of public 
<br/>office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a democratic society, the Opposition plays a crucial role in holding the 
<br/>Government accountable and ensuring that the interest of all citizens are represented in the decisions 
<br/>made by those in power.  I am honoured to be part of this vital function and we are committed to 
<br/>using our voice to fight for a better future for all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you all know, I come from the sugarcane belt area in Ba. I have lived 
<br/>mostly among the sugarcane farming community, and I know the sweat, struggles and the challenges 
<br/>farmers  and  their  families  go  through.    I  am  a  farmer  myself,  and  thanks  to  the  FijiFirst  Leader, 
<br/>honourable  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama  for  his  leadership  and  vision.    He  has  uplifted  the  sugar 
<br/>industry with initiatives that farmers benefitted from.  There were challenges in the sugar industry, 
<br/>however, the FijiFirst tried to minimise the damage it could have caused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji sugar industry supports the livelihood of thousands of Fijians - the 
<br/>benefits of cane growing standards beyond the fields and crushing mills.  The industry drives rural 
<br/>development such as upgraded rural roads, giving farmers access to agriculture inputs and machinery 
<br/>for their farms, and access to markets, urban centres, schools and health services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  was  doing  all  it  can  to  make  sure  cane  farming  provided  an 
<br/>adequate living to everyone within the industry.  Given the pressure of international prices and the 
<br/>need to make the industry more efficient, the FijiFirst Government allocated public funds to support 
<br/>programmes, aimed at increasing cane production and guaranteed cane prices to grow.  Some farmers 
<br/>even diversified into growing other agricultural produce and holding livestock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the impact of climate change and COVID-19 had placed new burdens on the cane 
<br/>industry and the Fijians who relied on it.  From 2016 to 2022, Category 5 storms inflicted damages 
<br/>nearly US$100 million on the industry and damaged some 600,000 tonnes of cane.  The pandemic 
<br/>also made it extremely difficult for the industry to hire technical experts from overseas to operate 
<br/>machinery and take on other work in the cane industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the leadership of honourable Bainimarama, we were able to strive for 
<br/></span><span>more  sustainable  and  more  resilient  cane  growing,  even  though  the  industry  confronted  new 
<br/>challenges  from  prolonged  ratooning  by  farming,  high  soil  acidity  and  poor  soil  health,  hilly 
<br/>topography and waterlogging and seawater intrusion into cane farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government had adopted new innovations to mechanise the 
<br/>industry  as  to  assist  farmers  in  reducing  the  cost  of  production  and  improving  their  viability, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including  undertaking  measures to  ensure that  all  stand-over  cane  was harvested, transported and 
<br/>proceed at the mills and income was generated for both, the farmers and FSC sugar sales. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Sugar Corporation had received new trucks that were distributed to all sectors.  This 
<br/>was to ease cane transportation issues.  Harvesters were also brought into operation so that cane could 
<br/>be harvested mechanically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, the industry which is a major source of employment, earn income 
<br/>for  many  people  in  Fiji  is  at  question.    The  new  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar,  out  of  the  blue, 
<br/>decides  to  make  changes  without  proper  consultation  with  the  farmers  and  assessment.    These 
<br/>changes now affect every employee and family that relies on the sugar industry… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I do not have to consult with you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- The Minister had gone ahead issuing directives that tractors, harvesters 
<br/>and trucks to be sold off as to save cost.  Has it been through his mind how his decision will impact 
<br/>the lives of farmers and families within the sugarcane communities around Fiji?  The question to him 
<br/>is. how will the cane be transported back to the mills?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Who will harvest the cane?  Well, labour today is hard to find, especially 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in a labour-incentive industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- We grow up as farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  I  am  a  farmer,  honourable  Member.  Who  will  plough  the  land  when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tractors are being sold off?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the sale of FSC machinery will affect the productivity and the efficiency of the 
<br/>sugar industry.  Modern machinery is essential in the sugar production process and selling them can 
<br/>lead to a decrease in the quality of sugar produced.  This can result in lower prices for sugar in the 
<br/>international market, affecting the revenue of the sugar industry and the economy as a whole.  The 
<br/>sale of these machineries will also affect production in farms that need harvesters to harvest cane and 
<br/>trucks to transport to the mill, causing farmers to lose their source of income and employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- With the selling of the trucks and machinery, farmers will need and will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have to pay more.  There is no balancing effect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what about their promise on the price of sugar? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- To be set at $110 a tonne 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>khalas</span><span>…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  the  FijiFirst  Government  has  done  for  our 
<br/>sugarcane price was that we assured the farmers that we will give $85 a tonne, never mind whether 
<br/>the price is $50 or $40, farmers get $85 so that it is what Government was paying for farmers.  This 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>219 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a guaranteed price which the FijiFirst Government was giving, and that is how it happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- They will give $110. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Next budget, $150. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.-  However, for this  new Coalition Government  we really do not  know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what trick and lies they have up their sleeve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must remind Members that the FijiFirst Government had pumped in more 
<br/>than $400 million into the sugar industry in the last 10 years, and that the revenue from sugar sales 
<br/>for that period was $2 billion.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the Coalition Government gets to the real 
<br/>people that needs assistance.  Rather than having a show around the country to keep them relevant, 
<br/>it is about time they conclude garlanding ceremonies and do the real work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- But maybe this is why they are pushing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- Salusalu Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- With those words Sir, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also congratulate you on your appointment. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians; I thank the 
<br/>honourable Speaker for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Address by His Excellency 
<br/>the President of the Republic of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, I wish to acknowledge His Excellency the President for his gracious speech addressing 
<br/>some of the most important issues that will be actioned by the Coalition Government. I also thank 
<br/>His Excellency for his motivating address and for setting the course for Coalition Government to set 
<br/>its way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Address by His Excellency addressed the most relevant issues that will 
<br/>be  addressed  by  the  Government  of  Fiji.    Issues  such  as  the  importance  of  the  Civil  Service  and 
<br/>improving its service delivery to the people of Fiji, transparency, accountability of Government to 
<br/>the  nation  economic  growth,  collaborative  approach  between  Government,  private  sector  and  all 
<br/>stakeholders, rural and maritime development connectivity coordination for disaster preparedness, 
<br/>introduction of Public Works Department (PWD) to focus on infrastructure improvement to meet the 
<br/>demands of modern Fiji with specific focus on rural development,  climate change, environment and 
<br/></span><span>also related legislative changes.   This and more are pertinent issues to address, and the responsibility 
<br/></span><span>lies with the Government particularly the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and 
<br/>Transport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture  I  sincerely  thank  my  predecessors,  honourable  Jone  Usamate  for  his 
<br/>contributions as Minister in the last government and the update by honourable Vijay Nath former 
<br/>Assistant  Minister  of  Infrastructure.      No  doubt  a  lot  of  work  has  been  done  but  this  is  a  new

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government,  new  beginning  with  new  opportunities.    No  government  is  perfect  and  we,  as  a 
<br/>Government, are here to assess and correct the mistakes and weaknesses of the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in taking up the role of Minister it is a very critical Ministry - Public Works, 
<br/>Meteorological and Transport. The efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery of Civil Servants 
<br/>in the Ministry has always been my emphasis and our Government emphasis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry alone has a human resource capacity of more than 600 staff providing the much-
<br/>needed services in all Divisions around Fiji focussing on infrastructure, water, energy, roads, MET 
<br/>services ensuring our state of preparedness during natural disasters and connecting people and cargo 
<br/>from our main urban centres to the maritime islands.  It is a challenge involving Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji (WAF), Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Maritime Authority 
<br/>of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of institutional strengthening and revival, the PWD has already mentioned that it 
<br/>will  focus  initially  on  primarily  on  rural  development  and  connectivity.  Each  responsibility  also 
<br/>includes maintenance and upgrade of rural roads and river crossings where FRA may have current 
<br/>challenges.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from this it is also envisaged where envisions that PWD will also 
<br/>be responsible for Rural Water Electrification and Sanitation Services in a complimentary manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  essentially  the  PWD  will  be  sharing  responsibilities  with  FRA  on  the 
<br/>maintenance and management of infrastructure particularly the 6,375 kilometres network to ensure 
<br/>resilience roads, bridges and jetties.   The Coalition Government has identified that there are roads 
<br/>that have not been maintain well by FRA such as agriculture and forestry access tourism related, rural 
<br/>access roads for social obligations as well as other sector access roads with the total length of 1,300 
<br/>kilometres located within the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is one of the reasons we need to reintroduce PWD.  The call for re-establishing PWD is 
<br/>also  because  of  lack  of  FRA  presence  in  the  depots  where  the  public  already  has  access  to 
<br/>Government Services and the deteriorated conditions on some of these rural roads including the non-
<br/>FRA roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  an  ongoing  issue  of  non-maintenance  of  rural  roads  as  mentioned  by  some 
<br/>honourable  Members  that  greatly  affects  their  basic  needs  to  essential  services  such  as  health, 
<br/>education and economic opportunity.  It will be a phased approach which will be undertaken to ensure 
<br/>smooth transition. The first step is to look at institutional strengthening and resource capability - there 
<br/>is a huge potential for PWD as a complement a competitive service provider including as a leading 
<br/>apprenticeship provider for our youths who are now crying out for opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an exciting prospect which will come in soon. There is also a need to reassess the 
<br/>management of government assets and properties. We have seen the deuterated state of Government 
<br/>properties including hospitals, staff quarters and schools and we will be looking at the management 
<br/>of that in terms of property management with proper asset databases and of course a programme of 
<br/>maintenance and budgeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also be working in partnership with other ministries, departments and communities, 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders to lift the standards on infrastructure as mentioned.  Only with uplifting of conditions 
<br/>in the rural and maritime, can we hope to reduce the issues of rural to urban drift stresses on urban 
<br/>infrastructure like electricity, water and housing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  improve  some  of  our  most  rural  areas,  the  Ministry  has  begun  piloting  a  Government 
<br/>community partnership programme to cut four access roads to villages that they have never any road

<div><span>access.  This include Nawaisomo to Nakini, Nawaisomo to Wairuarua and pilot cut of 3.3 kilometres 
<br/>including  Dreketi  Village,  Nakorovou,  Tubarua  and  a  pilot  cut  of  9.2  kilometres  including 
<br/>Nakorokoroyawa, Mataiwailevu, Nasava and Nasauvere Villages in the Naitasiri area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of access to proper water and sanitation facilities, Water Authority will continue to 
<br/>build new schemes and improve existing schemes, programmes such as rainwater harvesting which 
<br/>includes  the  delivery  of  water  tanks  will  continue.    In  addition  to  that,  water  carting  to  rural 
<br/>communities  will  be  improved  particularly  the  monitoring  of  areas  which  have  experience  long 
<br/>periods of water cuts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of access to energy, the Coalition Government will continue to deploy alternative 
<br/>energy  sources  including  solar,  micro-hydro  to  replace  the  use  of  expensive  diesel  generators, 
<br/>communities  and  village  operators  are  trained  to  effectively  and  sustainably  operate  and  manage 
<br/>these  projects.    The  re-establishment  of  Public  Works  Department  will  improve  service  delivery 
<br/>through the provision of reliable and sustainable work power supplies including minimum turnaround 
<br/>time for maintenance and repair, especially in renewable energy and we are also currently reviewing 
<br/>the regulatory and institutional frameworks governing independent power providers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the first few weeks, land transport accessibility in rural areas have been an issue with bus 
<br/>and  carrier  services  and  we  have  had  meetings  with  the  various  stakeholders  including  Fiji  Bus 
<br/>Operators Association not only to hear the issues but also discuss how can we provide services to 
<br/>reach areas that currently have no provision of services.  The Government has left a legacy of two 
<br/>standards of taxi services in Fiji, and this will be looked into and addressed, so as not to leave a lot 
<br/>of confusion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  maritime  access  Sir,  we  will  continue  to  improve  particularly  in  improving 
<br/>facilities  on  water  vessels.    The  Ministry  currently  provides  up  to  10  uneconomic  routes  to  our 
<br/>maritime islands with about 15 trips provided on a monthly basis.  About 13 economical routes have 
<br/>been identified that will require proper scheduling and better services to be provided with the primary 
<br/>focus of efficiency of services.  These will be a priority of this Government to ensure accessibility of 
<br/>transport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  coordination  of  disaster  preparedness,  the  Ministry  has  a  strong  working 
<br/>relationship with the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development.  In terms of Natural Disasters, 
<br/>through the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services and it has forecasted that in the 2022-
<br/>2023 cyclone seasons, we would have at least two tropical cyclone activities in the areas of operation.  
<br/>We would expect above-average rainfall leading to floods which we are now experiencing.  February 
<br/>and March are peak cyclone seasons, therefore, it is very important for all of us to remain vigilant 
<br/>and be prepared. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are only six specialised MET centres in the world, and Nadi is one of 
<br/>them.  This MET Hydrological events are to be expected in our small island states.  In September 
<br/>2021,  the  World  MET  Organisation  and  the  UN  office  of  Disaster  Risk  Deduction  reported  that 
<br/>climate change and increasingly extreme weather patterns have cause a surge in natural disasters over 
<br/>the past 50 years, disproportionately impacting poorer countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on to climate change, Sir, we cannot work alone in our efforts to mitigate and we 
<br/>will need to work with our neighbouring Pacific Islands and our honourable Prime Minister has led 
<br/>us in that area in terms of regional cooperation and repairing relations.  Whether it be at IRENA or 
<br/>the  World  MET  organisation,  we  must  emphasise  at  the  international  dialogues  that  we  are  a 
<br/>collective voice - not only are we fighting for our existence but also the needs of our member States.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the shipping sector, Sir, Fiji is committed to reducing Green House Gas Emissions from 
<br/>domestic shipping  by 40 percent  in  2013 and decarbonisation by 2050. These are very ambitious 
<br/>targets but one that the Coalition must re-see through to 2050 and again, we do acknowledge the role 
<br/>of the past Governments in trying to achieve this goal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  is  closely  working  with  our  partners  to  ensure  that  Fiji  is 
<br/>pushing in the international arena that we are also domestically transitioning to achieve our targets.  
<br/>All of the above are work in progress and we need to continue as we are participating in COP28.  In 
<br/>terms of policy and legislation, Sir, we will continue to upgrade, existing plans including national 
<br/>development  plan  relating  to  waste  water  infrastructure  and  water  and  align  ourselves  with  the 
<br/>Environmental Management Act 2005 for the protection of Fiji’s flora and fauna.  Sir, WAF will also 
<br/>increase its wastewater treatment capacity to treat wastewater to compliant levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has established a joint taskforce with ADB and among key ministries agency to 
<br/>review  Fiji’s  Building  Code,  the  review  and  encompasses  how  we  load  capacity  and  earthquake 
<br/>resilience to Category 5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  the  Energy  sector  there  will  be  impetus  to  accelerate  our 
<br/>renewable energy target and our transition to low carbon energy. I have mentioned blockages which 
<br/>are  currently  there  and  there  will  need  to  be  consultation  with  various  stakeholders,  ministries 
<br/>particularly  regarding  the  regulatory  frameworks  in  place  as  related  into  the  independent  power 
<br/>producers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transport, again, is a key driver and we are working in close collaboration with LTA and 
<br/>MSAF in terms of the various provisions in the legislation to be amended.  This amendment should 
<br/>not  only  to  assist  its  customers  but  also  provide  flexibility  in  implementation.    Some  current 
<br/>regulations and related processes are cumbersome and subject to abuse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  resilience  infrastructure,  the  new  Rewa  River  Water  Supply  Projects  Scheme 
<br/>which is designed to alleviate the current water problems in the Nausori, Suva to Lami corridor is in 
<br/>positive  progress  and  that  is  a  key  infrastructure  project  as  mentioned  by  honourable  Vijay  Nath 
<br/>which was initiated under the last Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Say the name. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The last Government – the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Yes,  sure,  in  addition  there  is  also  an  investment  of  $13.8 
<br/>million towards installation of pipelines from Sawani and the related areas from Viria.  We envisage 
<br/>this project to be completed in June-July.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in terms of transport connectivity, again this is important as I mentioned in terms of the 
<br/>deliveries of LTA, technological enhancement is very important and the upgrading of its IT systems, 
<br/></span><span>is an ongoing project and that is currently being reviewed to enhance our customer services.  There 
<br/></span><span>is a nationwide consultation to seek the views and opinions of customers so that LTA can better its 
<br/>services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  working  to  discuss  the  outcomes  of  national  consultation  especially  in 
<br/>provision of PSV permits. As the outgoing Government knows this is a critical area of continuous 
<br/>problem and complaints from our customers and the processes are cumbersome and we are currently 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>223 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>revieing those. Definitely, there will be no lottery like the last time that we will need to go through 
<br/>more rational process than a lottery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF continues to provide regulatory services that also includes training, 
<br/>boat license across the nation and it is an area in which we have seen a lot of engagement with youths.  
<br/>As I have mentioned, the revived PWD does not emphasised on apprenticeship and also with MSAF 
<br/>in terms of boat master licences. There is also high potential in that and there are positive discussions 
<br/>with various investors in terms of investment in those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will rely on the private sector on much needed services to our maritime islands and we 
<br/>also have our Government fleet, Sir.  However, most of them are aged, so there is an assessment for 
<br/>our  fleets  and  assets  and  there  needs  to  be  a  programme  of  asset  replacement  in  terms  of  our 
<br/>Government Shipping Services, because that is a key area in terms of our maritime connections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to adopt approaches that recognises the unique characteristics our 
<br/>settlements and communities and that is why, we, as a Ministry, are taking a phased-based approach 
<br/>in terms of our Ministry infrastructure reform and not in a rushed way, and we have initiated various 
<br/>plans and initiatives within the Ministry to ensure that is undertaken successfully.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  also  a  need  for  a  national  infrastructure  strategic  plan  and  there  is  ongoing 
<br/>discussions with our development partners to have that in place, especially the scoping and initial 
<br/>stages.  This is currently lacking and we will assist a lot of in terms of future guidelines - whatever 
<br/>comes in, including the budgeting element. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I end, I would like to also mention a few issues which have been 
<br/>raised  by  the  Opposition.    Let  me  just  point  out  those  issues.    They  have  raised  issues  of  ethno-
<br/>nationalism, Christian nationalism and </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> nationalism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I believe that the raising of these issues is an exaggeration of the current situation.  The 
<br/>Government has come in with its programme to address a lot of the issues which need to be addressed.  
<br/>A lot of that is to address historical injustices and some of the issues which have not been addressed 
<br/>in the past.  I feel that the Oppositions is creating a picture of instability by raising issues that we 
<br/>have raised and terming it as racists and ethno-nationalism, which is totally the opposite.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been issues about the 2013 Constitution.  The fact of the matter is that the 2013 
<br/>Constitution was born out of a military </span><span>coup</span><span> in 2006 and that cannot be denied, and that is an issue 
<br/>that we need to address as a Parliament.  If we go back into history which they have done, we did 
<br/>that when we produced the 1997 Constitution through consultations. And we need to do that too with 
<br/>the 2013 Constitution in order to address the situation created by 2006. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  do  support,  of  course,  the  calls  for  consensus  building  between  the  Opposition  and  the 
<br/>Government to address that because a lot of the issues in the 2013 Constitution which we are facing 
<br/>today in terms of the removal of the 1997 Constitution are ongoing and we need to address that and 
<br/>not leave it to our children or grandchildren.  It is our responsibility to come together to look at it in 
<br/>a  manner  which  is  conducive,  not  only  to  good  governance,  but  also  peace  and  stability  in  our 
<br/></span><span>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have mentioned nepotism, corruption and victimisation.  A due process 
<br/>is in place and there have been complaints about some who have been stopped at the airport.  That 
<br/>has  been  done  through  clear  legal  processes  through  FICAC.    There  are  ongoing  investigations, 
<br/>lodged formally in terms of complaints to the police.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, when we raise </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> issues, let me remind Parliament, that we are not racists, it is just 
<br/>to  address  pertaining  to  that  community.    For  example,  if  we  look  at  it  in  a  rational  manner,  the 
<br/>Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2019-2020 indicated that 74.8 percent of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> make 
<br/>up those in absolute poverty.  So, that kind of statistics make us think as leaders on how we address 
<br/>that, and it is not racist.  It is just the statistics that we need to raise and address.  As I have mentioned 
<br/>in the 2013 Constitution, there are issues within that which have been imposed and that need to be 
<br/>addressed and consented or discussed and consensus reached. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also various laws and decrees, and I can give 37 to the Opposition which affect the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> but they have not been consented to.  Some of them have raised the issue of UNDRIP and 
<br/>ILO169, which does not apply to Fiji.  My point is that, it applies, and they are saying the reason is 
<br/>that because the indigenous are the majority in Fiji.  I believe that reasoning is weak because in here, 
<br/>the  State  has  imposed  this  without  the  consent  of  the  indigenous.    So,  those  provisions  do  apply 
<br/>because the State has imposed that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the issues, Sir, that I would like to raise because I am very concerned about 
<br/>the narrative we are hearing that whatever we raise in terms of indigenous issues is termed as racist 
<br/>or ethno-nationalistic and it is discriminatory.  It is not, it is just raising issues which have not been 
<br/>consented to or to address historical injustices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those, Sir, I commend His Excellency the President’s Address to Parliament. </span><span> Vinaka

<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- The famous actor, Wendell Pierce, said, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The role of culture is that it’s the form through which we, as a society, reflect on who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are, where we've been and where we hope to be.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Book  of  Acts  Chapter  10:  34-35,  Peter  said:  “Truly  I  understand  that  God  shows  no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right, is acceptable to him.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Hinduism, the philosophy revolves around love and respect for others.  The Quran says, 
<br/>“O mankind, indeed we have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes 
<br/>that you may know one another.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; </span><span>miau sa bula re beha.  </span><span>It is, indeed, an honour and the privilege to be part of this august 
<br/>Parliament of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate you on your appointment and I wish you the very 
<br/>best  of  health  for  this  journey.  </span><span>Me  boi  yawa  iho  a  Tagimaucia  ni  Uluiqalau.    </span><span>I  also  offer  my 
<br/>congratulations to the Deputy Speaker, honorable Lenora Qereqeretabua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  past  few  weeks  have  been  both,  challenging  and  unforgettable.  I  must  thank  His 
<br/>Excellency the President for his words of wisdom during the Opening Session of Parliament.  His 
<br/>Excellency urged us to boldly face the ongoing and emerging challenges and to be resilient and have 
<br/>the resolve of our people at all times.  As a representative of the people, I will ensure that I will do 
<br/>my very best for the betterment of the people.

<div><span>To the 3,061 good citizens who voted for me, I am standing here because you believed in me,

<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, culture is the lifeline of a community. It provides us with the core values 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that help steer our daily lives both, as a person and more importantly as a society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is rich in cultural diversity which was build up through the period of our history, making  
<br/>us uniquely Fijian - strength in diversity as they say.  Promoting culture and valuing diversity for Fiji 
<br/>is important.  It goes without saying that culture is the ultimate renewable resource of humankind 
<br/>and societies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such value in diversity and promoting cultures and assets for society is important.  For 
<br/>more than a decade, this has been done from different umbrella of Government.  Now, for the lapse 
<br/>of 16 years, the culture family is whole again under the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage 
<br/>and Arts portfolio now includes the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts, the Fiji Arts Council, 
<br/>the Fiji Museum and the National Trust of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, protection and promotion of culture is only possible through legislation, 
<br/>policy  and  framework.    Being  party  to  the  United  General  Assembly,  Fiji  has  ratified  the  2003 
<br/>UNESCO Convention Intangible Culture Heritage and the 1972 World Heritage Convention.  Apart 
<br/>from this, the culture sector is also governed by the National Trust of Fiji (Amendment) Act 1998, 
<br/>National Heritage Strategy 1996, Fiji Museum (Amendment) Act 1994, Preservation of Object and 
<br/>Archaeological and Palaeontological Act 1940. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due  to  the  evolving  nature  of  culture,  the  team  is  working  towards  finally  submitting  to 
<br/>Cabinet the Traditional Knowledge and Expression of Culture Bill; a legislation and will safeguard 
<br/>the  intellectual  property  of  traditional  communities.    Fiji  Heritage  Bill  demarcates  to  process  for 
<br/>nomination  of  heritage  sites  consideration  at  national  level  to  comply  with  the  World  Heritage 
<br/>Convention.  The National Culture Policy Action Plan to regulate, protect, encourage and financially 
<br/>or otherwise support activities related to culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, culture is no longer seen as a barrier to development.  Today, it is widely 
<br/>viewed  as  a  cross  cutting  pillar  of  sustainable  development.    It  is  central  and  integral  of  social 
<br/>cohesion,  economic  development  and  environment  protection  but  most  importantly  develop  a 
<br/>resilient community.  A cultural audit has been done to the 14 provinces including Rotuma, Rabi and 
<br/>Kioa.  Verification of collected data has been done and this vital information will be issued for the 
<br/>betterment of decision making and service delivery to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 12</span><span>th</span><span> World Hindi Conference which is currently underway in Nadi is a testament of our 
<br/>diversity.  The weeklong event is in collaboration with the Government of India on the theme “Hindi 
<br/>Traditional Knowledge to Artificial Knowledge”.  There will be upcoming programs to uplift culture 
<br/>and our vehicle for national identity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, culture is also a vehicle for civic pride, some well-known areas come to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mind and these include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Waisali Forest Reserve in Savusavu;

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>227 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Parliament would agree with me that culture is also a vehicle for change.  
<br/>The  Ministry  will  ensure  cultural  awareness  activities  in  schools,  youth  groups,  villages  and 
<br/>communities  to  strengthen  identity  development,  spiritual,  physical,  intellectual  and  emotional 
<br/>condition  of  our  young  generation.    The  multi-cultural  centre  in  Labasa,  Ba  and  Nausori  have 
<br/>produced a lot of success stories in skilled musicians, dolak, harmonium, tabla, guitar and keyboard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  mention  the  important  role  played  by  the  Viti  Association  as  Visual 
<br/>Artists, the Fiji Islands Dance Association and other cultural association.  The cultural industry is an 
<br/>untapped potential for years, the Government is aware of this fact.  However, more work needs to be 
<br/>done. Of course, some targets have to be achieved.  For this, plans and strategies are currently being 
<br/>developed.  As an Assistant Minister for the cultural sector, it has been assigned under my office and 
<br/>together with the able staff, we will do our utmost best to have the plan realised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we have a unique opportunity in the next four years as a Member of 
<br/>this august Parliament to lead by example and be truly great, the visionary leaders to our people and 
<br/>our nation.  Let us unleash the treasure trove in Fiji’s cultural heritage.  I ask you all to rise to this 
<br/>challenge with me and make Fiji truly the paradise it can be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your patience and I support and commend the Address by 
<br/>His  Excellency,  the  President  of  Fiji.  May  God  bless  Fiji  and  her  beautiful  people,  thank  you</span><span>, 
<br/>Dhanyabad, Sa re beha vakalevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,    before  I  offer  the  floor  to  Honourable  Rinesh 
<br/>Sharma there are three more speakers that we have listed and are still remaining.  If it goes to 6 p.m. 
<br/>and I think it is best that we adjourn for dinner, dinner will be provided and before we resume again.  
<br/>So that is the only change that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/>and my fellow Fijians. </span><span>Ni sa bula, Namaste, Salaam’alaykum</span><span> and a very good evening to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as the Speaker 
<br/>and also congratulate the Deputy Speaker for her appointment as well.  To begin with, I would like 
<br/>to journey of how from my childhood, to how I overcome multiple challenges, to get into this very 
<br/>pristine and prestigious Parliament at the national level, to be a national leader at this very age.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am 29 years of age.  I was born and brought up in Lautoka City.  Mr Speaker Sir, I come 
<br/>from a simple small family of four where my parents worked their normal eight to five job.  I was 
<br/>raised by such parents who had Fiji at heart.  My parents had instilled in me a strong sense of fairness, 
<br/>love for people, morals and virtues since childhood.  Childhood was going well for us until life took 
<br/>a turn and our family lost everything when I was in Class 5.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you realise that your parents’ monthly income is less than the monthly 
<br/></span><span>expenses,  that  little  boy  became  an  adult.    At  a  very  early  age  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  realised  the 
<br/></span><span>challenges that was ahead of me, and we needed to overcome as a family. We did not have much 
<br/>then but all we had was each other, and indeed family is the biggest pillar of strength - family is 
<br/>everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  finished  my  primary  education  at  Lautoka  Chinese  School,  secondary 
<br/>education at Natabua High and after high school I was not fortunate to get into university rather I did 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>door to door sales, I worked at a carwash company, I painted houses, I used to be a Bartender at Port 
<br/>Marina and I worked eight months at McDonalds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, I reflect back on those days of rejection, hardships and struggles and 
<br/>pain and I smile.  Back then it was part of life, and it was about survival.  Right after that I got a 
<br/>scholarship  to  study in  India through the  Indian  High Commission.  I am  a software  engineer by 
<br/>Degree and I specialise in automation.  Automation is the basics of software, electronic and electrical 
<br/>engineering,  and  in  particular,  I  specialise  in  climate  control  farming  systems  and  aquaculture 
<br/>systems.  I believe, when I was in India, I saw Fiji as a land of opportunity, but today it is not just a 
<br/>land of opportunity, it is an ocean of opportunity.  The other very reason I wanted to return to Fiji is 
<br/>where home is where the heart is and heart is where my mum and dad are and I wanted to spend all 
<br/>these years and their face of life with them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  the  vision  to  return  to  Fiji  and  contribute  to  our  agriculture  and 
<br/>fisheries sector to build mote climate resilient and sustainable systems to create value added food and 
<br/>supply chains, promote food security and work towards carbon sequestration projects with a goal to 
<br/>build  more  resilient  and  robust  ecosystems,  in  particular,  our  food  system  for  the  Fijians,  by  the 
<br/>Fijians.  As a youth of this country, I was well aware of the resources available and the skills our 
<br/>people have.  This is the vision I returned with in 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a farmer and entrepreneur, I realised that we can have the best technology, 
<br/>yet the real issue is that Fiji needs more farmers in the process of winning awards and accolades.  I 
<br/>shared my success, I empowered and engaged with various communities, children and the special 
<br/>need with the ideology of leaving no Fijian behind.  In the pursuit to find profits as an entrepreneur, 
<br/>I found a purpose, the purpose was to impact as many lives as possible.  As a farmer and entrepreneur, 
<br/>I have proudly represented my nation on various Regional and international platforms and I have 
<br/>realised that if I could do this little bit on my own, I can only imagine what I can achieve at a national 
<br/>level with a national team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I manifested this in 2018, with shear hard work and good intentions is the 
<br/>very reason I am standing here before you deliver the speech.  That is the power of manifestations 
<br/>and hard work and truly when you believe in God, your visions become a reality.   A message to all 
<br/>the  farmers  of  Fiji,  farming  is  a  job  of  prestige  honour  and  dignity.    From  cultivating  land  to 
<br/>cultivating hope of leadership through modern agriculture, it has been a roller coaster of a journey 
<br/>from the farms of Fiji to the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji, still being in my twenties.  I deeply 
<br/>humbled with this new responsibility.  In this journey, I have learnt that our success is shaped from 
<br/>our challenges and our failing points are our learning curves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I came into this with no campaign experience and no connections.  I stood 
<br/>in line and I applied because I wanted to do something for my country, and I feel very humbled to be 
<br/>here.    I  have  looked  up  to  Parliament  sessions  and  to  all  the  leaders,  and  I  have  taken  as  much 
<br/>inspirations as possible.  I would like to thank God, my parents, friends and families in Fiji, in the 
<br/>Region and globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  our  Leader,  honourable  Bainimarama,  our  General  Secretary,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Sayed-Khaiyum for believing in me and trusting me with the whole process.  I would like to thank 
<br/></span><span>the entire FijiFirst family and most importantly, my voters.  If it had not been for you, I would not 
<br/>have been here.  I would like to congratulate my colleagues on this side of Parliament as we represent 
<br/>the single largest Party, and my sincere and profound gratitude to every Fijian for their unwavering 
<br/>support for FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the outcome of any election is not about a Party winning, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>229 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>believe that the outcome of any election should be about the people of this country winning.  If we 
<br/>want to build the economy, we must inbuild and invest in our people and the economy will build 
<br/>itself.  Election is not a spectator sport, rather it is a participatory event and I urge all Fijians who did 
<br/>not vote, please, do vote in the next election because that is your right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, at the end of the day, should be about bringing changes of 
<br/>growth, prosperity and peace, and this is the way the people of a country will win.  I stood for election 
<br/>as a FijiFirst candidate to offer genuine, community-phasing and cohesive way of contributing to the 
<br/>betterment and well-being for my Fijian people.  I am a software engineer entrepreneur, a farmer and  
<br/>today, a Member of Parliament or rather like how I say it, I am a public servant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will strongly and faithfully expand my efforts and energy that is needed 
<br/>to protect and enhance, to engage and collaborate, and to negotiate outcomes that will build more 
<br/>cohesive, prosperous and an empowered Fiji.  Sir, that is my commitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  sincerely  congratulate  our  new  Prime  Minister,  new 
<br/>Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers  on  their  new  appointments  of  roles  of  leadership  and 
<br/>responsibilities to take us Fijians forward. A lot has been said during the campaigns, a lot of promises 
<br/>were made and, yes, if these promises are fulfilled it is for the betterment of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today  we  witnessed  a  very  big  Government  of  29  Ministers  and  three 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, and the number of portfolios held by some of the Ministers.  This is, indeed, 
<br/>not just about track records, this is a new global record for such a big government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  seen  the  continuous  breach  of  policies  and  procedures  as  the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  has  been  successful  with  advertising  Board  positions  yet  had  appointed 
<br/>members before the deadline.  It is evident.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what made me happy yesterday was that when honourable Gavoka praised 
<br/>Fiji  Airways,  he  had  failed  to  show  any  appreciation  for  the  FijiFirst  Government  that  took  the 
<br/>strategic decisions and policies, even in times of COVID-19 that the resilient leadership shown by 
<br/>FijiFirst to keep the airline afloat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe  as  a  young  leader  that  the  art  of 
<br/>appreciation goes a long way.  If we fail to appreciate the small things in life, how will we be blessed 
<br/>with the bigger ones?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that brings my attention to the honourable Minister of Finance.  Honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad, Sir, people are waiting to hear from you as to when the minimum wage will be $5? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yet, we hear in the news that minimum wage is $4 and that it will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be reviewed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was promised in 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also awaiting when social welfare assistance 
<br/>will be increased from $100 to $200.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been getting messages of when 
<br/>the prices of lamb chops will be reduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish I had the number for the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Finance so that I can pass it on to them and they can talk directly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know who is writing your speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I am glad you know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we witnessed a big Government, yet a budget is 
<br/>necessary. With today’s delivery speech by honourable Professor Prasad, I was  expecting to hear 
<br/>something about the budget, but no.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last eight years, he has not provided a single alternative 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget, so I think it is going to take a while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We know who is writing your speech.  We know it, boy! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Tell us about the minimum wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, no running commentary, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you and I, in fact, everyone would agree that great 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things take time, but the FBC logo did not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  another pressing matter is  the future of this country.   The youth  are the 
<br/>future of this nation.  My selection in the Election as a Member of Parliament is a clear message to 
<br/>the people that the young people of this country have the abilities, capabilities and potential to dream 
<br/>and make those dreams a reality. You do not need to migrate abroad to make your dreams come to 
<br/>reality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a message to the young people of this country, again, Fiji is not just a land 
<br/></span><span>of opportunities, but it is an ocean of opportunities.  You are never too small or young to make a 
<br/></span><span>difference. In fact, we mature and attain wisdom not by age but by experiences of life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The youth of this nation are the future. They are the ones who will be taking over jobs and 
<br/>businesses in the near future, thus it is imperative to have a well-educated generation of young people.  
<br/>Young  people  need  to  be  empowered,  educated  about  their  rights  and  responsibilities  and  given 
<br/>opportunities for leadership roles in order to make an impact on society at large.  Some examples of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>231 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>youth leadership include youth entrepreneurs, activists, youth influences and youth change makers. 
<br/>In particular, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of Parliament has two young selected candidates and elected 
<br/>Members of Parliament and this is a beginning of a new era.  This is evident, Sir, that young people 
<br/>are not kept away from this Chambers and they have a role to play at a national level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to enlighten how this Coalition Government is empowering and 
<br/>supporting the youth of this country.  When it comes to TELS and Toppers Scheme, there is a huge 
<br/>amount of uncertainty, nor directives and confusions from the students. The students are asking me 
<br/>because I do not have the number for our honourable Minister of Finance or the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Multi-Ethnic Affairs or the honourable Minister for Education, so they can directly speak to them.  
<br/>The TELS students are confused, worried and frustrated if their TELS would continue. The student 
<br/>loans would be forgiven or not is a question they ask.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another pressing matter is about the job opportunities for those who have 
<br/>graduated  as  retirement  age  has  gone  out  to  60  as  this  is  a  clear  indication  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government that they do not believe in the capabilities and potential of the young people who have 
<br/>graduated to enter the workforce.  Where is the support for the students to study? Where is the support 
<br/>and job creation for the young people to enter the employment sector?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Ask honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hon. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is because of the votes of these students that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promised and the 2013 Constitution is that, why is this Government today? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why I stand with FijiFirst is because one of the most profound reasons and 
<br/>that reason is equality. My leader, honourable Bainimarama, the most beautiful thing he ever said 
<br/>during a campaign which I witnessed was, you all are Fijians.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when there 
<br/>is no equality that is the beginning of racial division and segregation.  Their speeches talk about unity 
<br/>and inclusion, but their actions are otherwise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, where there is no equality, there is no democracy, there is no freedom, there 
<br/>is no acceptance, there is no sense of belonging, there is no confidence within the people. To my 
<br/>understanding, we altogether make up the economy of this country, yet if you want the economy to 
<br/>improve people need to feel accepted.  They need to feel confident, only then people will perform at 
<br/>their best. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe the leadership is not about being the best, but it is about bringing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out the best in your people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  the  people  on  social  media,  we  as  citizens  of  this  nation  have  a 
<br/>responsibility of what we like, comment and share.  Hatred, negativity, threats and abuse will do us 
<br/>no good at an individual and national level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  conclude  I  have  a  message  for  the  younger  generations  of  this 
<br/>nation. You are the result of your choices you make. Your challenges and failures will shape your 
<br/></span><span>success and, yes, you are all leaders in your domains.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, we have a generation who is multi-talented and who are multi-tasking 
<br/> on a daily basis.  A message to them is, if I can make something out of life from cultivating land, I 
<br/>can  only  imagine  what  this  young  generation  will  do  and  the  heights  they  will  reach  and  the 
<br/>opportunities they will unlock for the betterment of this nation.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  envision  to  see  more  youth  participate  in  elections  and  actually  be 
<br/>Members  of  Parliament.    After  my  teenage  days,  all  I  wanted  to  do  was  to  be  a  great  son  to  my 
<br/>parents, that is all.  But this journey has led on where now, this son commits to serve his motherland, 
<br/>a place I call home.  This is my home, the paradise of Fiji Islands and I am a very proud Fijian.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I congratulate all Members of Parliament.  On our shoulders rest the hope and 
<br/>well-being of our nation, and to the young people of this nation, we are the future and together, we 
<br/>can take this country forward.  God bless us all and God bless our Fiji.

<br/>the honour and praises for the great things he has done and for the many more amazing things he will 
<br/>continue to do in our lives. I address this Parliament with gratitude for what has come as a sense of 
<br/>duty, for what we must do in responding to the motion before Parliament. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to join my fellow Members in Parliament to extend my warmest congratulation 
<br/>to you, Sir, as the new elected Speaker in this august Parliament and the same sentiment to the Madam 
<br/>Deputy  Speaker.  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Cabinet.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please 
<br/>allow me to acknowledge and greet all our people, our friends joining us this afternoon in the gallery 
<br/>and also our friends joining us this evening via television, livestreaming on the Parliament website 
<br/>and </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page or the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> apps or radio, it is indeed a privilege and a great pleasure for me to 
<br/>take this time to say </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> to every one of you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to thank His Excellency the President for his gracious speech 
<br/>on  the  3</span><span>rd</span><span>  February,  2023  while  opening  this  year’s  Parliament.    Before  I  do  that  let  me  pay  my 
<br/>sincere gratitude and respect to those individuals that took time to exercise their constitutional right 
<br/>during the 2022 General Election. I thank all the registered voters especially those they have placed 
<br/>their trust in FijiFirst and in return we owe their best effort and their selfless judgement.

<br/>sincere gratitude to the late reverend Doctor Poate Uculoa Mata, my spiritual dad, the founder and

<br/>both local and abroad, the National Advisory Board, thank you most sincerely for your prayers, for 
<br/>laying hands on me and for your continuous support.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  also  thank  my  team  at  the  Daily  Care  Dental  Clinic,  Dr.  Maher 
<br/>Angus,  Taraivina  Marama,  Ceva  Bulabalavu,  and  Mohit  Mani  -  your  continued  support  before, 
<br/>during and post-election of 2022 - thank you most sincerely for continuing our service to our patients.  
<br/>To my wife, Makereta Sotutu over 25 years, I have never met anyone so captivating, thank you for 
<br/>being my best partner in life and in my  every step up to this point  - I love you. To our children, 
<br/>Akuila, Adi Mere and Usaia, thank you for bearing with me.  The title I cherish most is that I am 
<br/>your dad - the greatest joy and blessing is knowing that you love me more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, both my parents have worked hard, dad had his own small fishing business 
<br/>and was also repairing engines without any formal qualification or education, and also a subsistence 
<br/>farmer.  My mum was the best housewife, who loved me so dearly as her youngest on our family of 
<br/>five siblings.  My parents encouraged us to work hard and serve people with dignity and humility.  
<br/>Over two thirds of elected Members of this Parliament have already spoken, I believe by now the 
<br/>message is very clear and is honing home.   I have taken some time since the formation of the grand 
<br/>Coalition Government and reflect on their actions lately, and against His Excellency the President’s 
<br/>Speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this time granted to me to highlight a few points.   His Excellency the 
<br/>President,  while  acknowledging  the  contribution  and  achievement  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  in 
<br/>steering the nation in the past 16 years, was to me, incorrect.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the record, FijiFirst 
<br/>only served eight years, completing two terms in the Fijian Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President  in  his  opening  remarks,  expresses  the 
<br/>announcement  of  policies,  intentions  and  some  of  the  proposed  legislations  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government.  My advice to the Coalition Government is not to change what is working well - if it is 
<br/>not broken, do not fix it.  Through one vote by the king maker, a new grand Coalition Government 
<br/>has been formed, and I wish you the very best.  In this term of Parliament, I had to remind myself 
<br/>that every single Member of this Parliament is the elected representative of the people of Fiji, and I 
<br/>am blessed to be one of the 55, although coming in late, to be given this parliamentary privilege.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent general election has seen a great shift in how information is shared 
<br/>on social media heavily influences the votes.  The power of social media has become the primary 
<br/>source for information in this day and age for almost everything.  I was saddened to see large amounts 
<br/>of misinformation been posted and shared on various social media platforms and how even the truth 
<br/>was grossly warped to suit the desired outcome. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now the honourable Member of this Parliament.   I urge all Members 
<br/>from both sides of the Parliament, let us work together to be responsible in our engagement in all 
<br/>social media platforms.  Let us leave a legacy that we can do this together.  The cyber space  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, if not handled responsibly will definitely invade our privacy, divide our families and 
<br/>destroy our sovereignty as a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Member of the Opposition we will keep the Coalition Government in 
<br/>check at all times.  As you will note Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are continually reminding them on their 
<br/>100 days promises to the people of Fiji.  I would see myself coming from a diverse background.  I 
<br/></span><span>am a proud Christian as many of my colleagues in the august Parliament.  I am the leader now in my 
<br/></span><span>church, holding the position the President of the Apostles Fellowship International taking over the 
<br/>mantle from its founder the late Reverend Dr. Poate Uculoa Mata.  My faith is the cornerstone of my 
<br/>life and my family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my life experience has moulded me to be a person I am today.  I have waded 
<br/>across rivers, walked barefoot, worked little jobs here and there to help pay my education.  Most of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>235 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the children today do not know these difficulties for that I am grateful to the vision of the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  by  creating  and  establishing  Free  Education  Grant  for  our  children  from  Early 
<br/>Childhood Education right up to Year 13.  I am grateful that this will not be taken away as alluded 
<br/>to by the honourable Radrodro the Minister for Education.  And on that Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can all 
<br/>agree  in  the  Parliament  that  education  is  a  need  and  education  is  the  key  and  that  it  is  the  very 
<br/>foundational fabric of a knowledge based Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been asked many times about 
<br/>my views in Fiji if Fiji were to be declared a Christian State.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel that one of our great strengths is the fact that we are multi-cultural, 
<br/>multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation whose diversity is well known for.  We have the making of a 
<br/>great and powerful little nation in the blue continent because of our diversity. To understand my view 
<br/>we  must  read,  learn  and  understand  the  great  commandment  from  Mathew  22:36-40  (NIV 
<br/>translation) and I quote:  “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?  Jesus replied love 
<br/>the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and with all your mind”.  This is the first and the 
<br/>greatest commandment and the second is like it, “love your neighbour as yourself”.  It goes on to say 
<br/>that, “…all the laws and the prophet hand on these two commandments.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  take  this  moment  to  focus  on  something  that  is  deeply 
<br/>pressing on my heart and also advocated by the Coalition Government and that is love.  The great 
<br/>commandments speak of love. People outside this august Parliament need  to be loved and we, as 
<br/>Cabinet, must have genuine love for all Fijians who brought us here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is one of the key elements of His Excellency’s Speech.  What this past few weeks has 
<br/>shown me is that Fiji has lost its way.  Love is no longer the core value of our nation anymore.  Hate 
<br/>has taken over and we need to work together to restore this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Pope John Paul II during his visit to Fiji in 1986 said, and I quote: “Fiji the 
<br/>Way  the  World  Should  Be”.    There  was  once  a  time,  Sir,  that  Fiji  was  famous  for  our  love  and 
<br/>hospitality, but it has been slowly eroding away.  It is the humble plea of the Opposition to remind 
<br/>the other side of Parliament to uphold the 2013 Constitution as it embraces love, multiracial harmony, 
<br/>respect for each other’s culture, language and tradition.  I see how much hate has been thrown around, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, in the last few weeks. It is beyond me. Families are split. They will not talk to each 
<br/>other. Friends are now strangers, and this is not the Fiji I know and love.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hear the talk of turning Fiji into a Christian State but if the core value of Christianity 
<br/>which is love is not there, why must we force it to people when we ourselves cannot love and care 
<br/>for one another.  If love is the great commandment, then logically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, hate would be 
<br/>the ultimate sin.  I, myself, am humbled of the fact that anyone can practice their faith the way they 
<br/>choose, but we must remember that our faith in God in between us as an individual and not  as a 
<br/>group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It all starts inside each and every one of us. God wants that personal relationship. He wants 
<br/>the love that he has so freely given to each one of us so that everyone of us can share.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>we must never forget that God is love.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our job as elected Members of this august Parliament to think of every 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian and do right to all of them. In the words of Robert Heinlein, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It  is  a  bad  sign  when  people  of  a  country  stop  identifying  themselves  with  the 
<br/>country  and  start  identifying  with  a  group,  a  racial  group  or  a  religion  or  a  language. 
<br/>Anything, as long as it is not the whole population.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to be united. We need to pray and work together, removing all 
<br/>hatred. The wellbeing of our beloved nation is relying on the 55 Members of this august Parliament 
<br/>to do  the right thing - refrain from the hurt that is trying to rule our heart.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My hope and prayer, Mr. Speaker, is that we can put aside our ideological differences and 
<br/>think  of  our  beloved  nation  first  and  foremost.  We  are  all  Fijians.  We  must  rebuke  all  forms  of 
<br/>divisional politics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if I may, before I establish myself in the private sector I have toiled in the public 
<br/>health sector for almost 30 years.  I also taught in the Dental School and serve as a Board member in 
<br/>the Fiji Medical and Dental Council.   I was one of the many who worked tirelessly to bring the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic under control. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree that there are many areas in the Public Health Sector that needed improvement. It does 
<br/>not mean that FijiFirst was turning a blind eye to have an efficient and effective delivery of healthcare 
<br/>services. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji already has an advanced, equitable and accessible healthcare 
<br/>system put in place by FijiFirst for all Fijians. The general public can access services from General 
<br/>Practitioners (GPs), Dental Practitioners (DPs), Pharmacists, laboratory services, x-ray, even get a 
<br/>heart  surgery  done  locally  now  for  free  under  the  Government  Medical  and  Dental  Health  Care 
<br/>Scheme.   This is amazing and must be commendable, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as one of the many Ministry of Health staff that worked long hours to help 
<br/>contain COVID-19, I would like to share my personal experience.  I saw how thousands of families 
<br/>lost their loved ones.  Almost every one of them could not pay their proper respect to their loved 
<br/>ones.  Forty-foot containers and trucks were converted to temporary morgue to accommodate the 
<br/>spillover from our normal mortuary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most healthcare workers, the Military and the Police stayed away from their families for over 
<br/>eight to ten weeks in order to maintain their bubbles.  Thanks to FijiFirst for their decisive leadership 
<br/>and thanks to FijiFirst for the effective mitigation strategies, including the “No Jab No Job” policy 
<br/>needed at that time, and that saw us out of the woods while strong nations, like Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand are still searching for the right footing in managing that pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Dr.  Lalabalavu  has  highlighted  some  of  the  reviews  of  the 
<br/>legislations under the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.  </span><span>Vuniwai</span><span> (Doctor), may I add to the 
<br/>list the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>The Review of the Medical and Dental Act 2011; 
<br/>Confirmation of the Appointment of the National Advisor Oral Health; 
<br/>Establish the Renumeration for those dentists that have already completed their speciality 
<br/>training but they are still put together as normal dentists; 
<br/>General review of the Dental Public Health Policy and Guideline; 
<br/>Proper  implementation  of  the  M-supply  programme  that  you  have  mentioned  in  your 
<br/>Maiden  Speech.    I  wish  to  seek  that  this  is  properly  resourced,  establishment  and 
<br/>remuneration. 
<br/></span><span>Accredited training for our Biomedical Technicians and Engineers.  This will decrease the 
<br/></span><span>breakdown in all our sophisticated medical and dental equipment that are installed in our 
<br/>hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I end my speech today with a simple plea, may the love of God fill all our 
<br/></span><span>hearts and may the action of Government be a reflection of God’s love and his genuine love for all 
<br/></span><span>Fijians.  V</span><span>inaka vakalevu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  May God bless Fiji.

<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to join my colleagues on this side of the 
<br/>People’s Coalition Government to wholeheartedly support the Motion before Parliament as presented 
<br/>by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  offer  my  thanks  and  respectful  commendation  to  His 
<br/>Excellency the President’s most gracious Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  want  to  congratulate  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  on  your  ascend  to  steer  ship  of  this  august 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament and the honourable Qereqeretabua as Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency’s wise counsel to us all, urging us to be united as one nation 
<br/>and strengthen our resolve to work together to meet our collective challenges and to continue to look 
<br/>after each other, especially those less fortunate and the most vulnerable members of our society, must 
<br/>be the guiding principles for which we dispense our role in this august Parliament for our people who 
<br/>have sent us here and who pay us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, permit me at this juncture to acknowledge and honour God and some 
<br/>key individuals who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to send me to Parliament to serve the nation.  
<br/>To all my supporters and voters who stood by me here in Fiji and abroad, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu saka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge  especially  my  voters  in  Tailevu  North  from  the  different  </span><span>tikina</span><span>  of  Tailevu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>North and the different villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I greatly acknowledge my loving wife, Sereana, and my children who bore the brunt of the 
<br/>long  campaign nights  and gruelling  schedules.   Thank you for patiently  being  the base for me  at 
<br/>home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also remember will deep fondness and love my late mother, who passed away shortly after 
<br/>my maiden speech in Parliament in 2014.  She was a single mother, Mr. Speaker, who fought hard 
<br/>to give me the best and is the strongest woman next to my wife, and I.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also acknowledge my late grandfather, the late Mosese Radokana, who was the only father 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>figure I knew and the mentor on how to behave like gentleman with humility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I offer my sincere gratitude and thanks to my National Federation Party colleagues and its 
<br/>machinery, and its continuous support, especially to Mr. Kamal Iyer, who is my constant reminder, 
<br/>second to my wife, about my medication.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  very  indebted  to  my  tireless  campaign  team  and  I  would  like  to  thank  them  most 
<br/>sincerely – </span><span>Momo</span><span> </span><span>Tamai Kini</span><span> from Dakuivuna, Sitino, </span><span>Tamai Kele</span><span> and Sili from Delasui, and all my 
<br/>hardworking polling agents from Tailevu North and throughout Fiji.  Also, I want to acknowledge 
<br/>NFP  team  in  Sydney  and  Canberra,  especially  to  Mr.  Herbert  Pickering,  Sunil,  George,  James 
<br/>Mataitini and the Fijian community in Sydney for their support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I want to acknowledge and pay my respects to my Nasinu and Nausori Campaign Team – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>John Lutua and </span><span>Naita</span><span> Karalo from Nausori and the Tupua family of Wainibuku.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I send my heartfelt congratulation, Sir, to my mentor, Father Alan Finn, Congregation of the 
<br/>Mission of the Saint Vincent De Paul Society from Natovi, who turns 90 years old in a few weeks 
<br/>from today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am eternally grateful to the Society of the Marist Brothers in Oceania, who were at St. Johns

<div><span>College in Cawaci for over 200 years, building the Catholic character in education for the people of 
<br/>Fiji.  They, Mr. Speaker, have departed Cawaci for good during the last few weeks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am a proud product of Cawaci, standing tall like Mount Tomuna, towering to 
<br/>blue, with others who have passed through its gates over the centuries, and I will be forever indebted 
<br/>to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also pay humble tribute to Father Kevin Barr for his work for liberty and sheer pain and who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was assisting in the sharing of his deepest thoughts on these issues with me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to acknowledge my prayer power base, Mr. Speaker, and they are the </span><span>Bubu</span><span> or the 
<br/>retired Nuns of the Sisters of our Lady of Nazareth who are in Wailoku. I would like to thank them 
<br/>for their prayers and this has kept me going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  collaboration  with  the  people  of  Fiji  is  essential  to  the  People’s  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s philosophy of national leadership.  For 16 years, the people have been told what to 
<br/>do, how to think and how to act by FijiFirst.  We are different, we lead not simply in coalition with 
<br/>each other, but in coalition with the people of Fiji the most.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Already, we are seeing an unprecedent willingness of people to speak out and highlight the 
<br/>menacing abuse of office that was right under the leadership of Frank Bainimarama and Aiyaz Sayed-
<br/>Khaiyum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I often wonder when we talk amongst ourselves as Government Members about what we are 
<br/>slowly discovering, how the Opposition side, where their hidden minions are likely pulling strings 
<br/>right now from their Chambers upstairs, sleep at night.  The slow grind towards rolling back all their 
<br/>dark and nefarious tentacles of money flows, insulated by laws is simply staggering,  Mr. Speaker. 
<br/>And we are ever thankful to the voters and taxpayers for their patience, as we do what we need to do 
<br/>lawfully.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there is one key difference in leadership styles, it is the Prime Minister who ensures that 
<br/>we actually talk to each other in Cabinet and take decisions together, unlike the former Cabinet and 
<br/>the former Government.  Our honourable Prime Minister then faces up to the public to tell them that 
<br/>Cabinet has decided in in their name and freely fills question from the media, unlike the grumpy one 
<br/>way </span><span>khaas khabre</span><span> communication that we all know of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to digress for a moment.  On Monday, we endured listening 
<br/>to the callosal disaster, that was the Leader of the Opposition’s speech.  As I told the media, this is a 
<br/>Member of Parliament who still cannot stomach that he lost the election, and that the people have 
<br/>rejected him and his Party.  Their creative scheme about election numbers does not change the fact 
<br/>of the matter, that his Party only received 42.5 percent of the total vote … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of order.  The matter being referred to by the honourable Minister 
<br/>is  before  the  Privileges  Committee.    I  think  he  ought  not  to  be  speaking  about  it.    Just  that,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, please continue with your speech but can we confine 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it to the very core of what you want to deliver, instead of going back … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking about the decline of their popularity, 
<br/>there was a woeful decline in their popularity rates which plummeted from the 59.2 percent of the 
<br/>total votes cast in the 2014 General Elections.   So, no matter how hard he cries and despite his side 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>telling us about the personal votes he got, what does not change is that, he sits that side of Parliament 
<br/>and we sit on this side of Parliament.  This is after all the electoral system of their own making that 
<br/>the Leader of the Opposition and his side …legalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to update this august Parliament of my policy intentions as the 
<br/>Minister for Home Affairs.  The fundamental focus of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration 
<br/>is to keep the people of Fiji safe.  Our national border, as we know, witnessed many cross-border 
<br/>movements of illicit products, of humans, of investments, of trade and cargo, of fisheries and marine 
<br/>species, of natural disasters, of remote sensing and satellite capability, of hard drugs, of money flows, 
<br/>of  global  pandemic  diseases,  of  proprietary  scientific  exploration  intelligence  and  of  carbon 
<br/>emissions among many others.  Fiji’s line border protection through Immigration must be hardened 
<br/>up dynamically to pre-empt and withstand all these daily direct security risks and challenges to the 
<br/>people of Fiji, which are then absorbed by our national security and law and order arms, if not guarded 
<br/>against.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  the  complementarity  and  the  synergy  of  immigration  with  the 
<br/>national security and law and order arms of Government, that I foresee as the lens with which to 
<br/>work.  The People’s Coalition Government is committed to a defence review as announced by His 
<br/>Excellency the President.  I have had discussions with both the honourable Prime Minister and the 
<br/>Commander of the RFMF and they are supportive of this idea.  Unlike the previous Government that 
<br/>wasted money by commissioning a defence review only to then collect dust somewhere just because 
<br/>one individual may have felt it was his personal fiefdom to rule at will, we are committed and we 
<br/>have a shared understanding about the mammoth task required to enhance the safety of the people of 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The defence review will be headed by civilian and an independent panel of experts, with the 
<br/>extensive experience in national and international security and defence matters.  The panel will be 
<br/>drawn from members of academia, civil society and the security and defence industry and service 
<br/>providers.   One of the aims of the Defence Review will be to define in  very precise terms, Fiji’s 
<br/>national  interests  and  objectives  in  the  complex  and  ever-changing  global  landscape  we  find 
<br/>ourselves in today.  Once this is defined, it will help shape our Foreign and Security policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Defence  Review will also  recommend a national  security  framework for 
<br/>Fiji.  This framework is envisaged to serve as a foundation for the continued professionalization of 
<br/>the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.  Mr Speaker, it is only reasonable to expect that the people of 
<br/>Fiji  want  the  RFMF  to  regain  a  strategic  fit  for  Fiji's  society.    By  that  I  mean,  that  there  is  an 
<br/>expectation for the RFMF to reposition itself in society as a loyal servant of the State, and not the 
<br/>master of it - contrary to the delusion that the previous Government promoted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within  the  proposed  national  security  framework,  we  want  to  use  the  civilian  supremacy 
<br/>model of civil-military relations. It is long past time to turn the 16-year mess under FijiFirst on this 
<br/>front, right side up. If you ask the people of Fiji, they will tell you that they expect the RFMF (and 
<br/>the  Police  too  for  that  matter)  to  be  subject  to  civilian  control  and  that  they  be  governed  by 
<br/>procedures, normally used in a parliamentary democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, it has to be subjected to checks and balances like any other arm of government.  
<br/></span><span>This includes parliamentary scrutiny of budgetary issues and the like - and that Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 
<br/>very simple terms is what democratic oversight is all about.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just add that the principle of civilian supremacy over the military is 
<br/>used by many western governments around the world. The USA, France, Australia. New Zealand, 
<br/>Canada and other western nations respect this principle.  Even our wantoks in PNG use this principle

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the management of their defence forces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you all know, the civilian supremacy model has its roots in the English Bill of Rights of 
<br/>1689 which established the concept of parliamentary sovereignty and civil liberties as being above 
<br/>the prerogatives of the ruling monarch.  In other words, it established the supremacy of Parliament 
<br/>and the recognition of free speech, human rights, civil liberties etc.  Indeed, modern representative 
<br/>government is based on the consent of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to emphasise that sovereignty in Fiji should lie in parliament where 
<br/>the  voice  of  the  people  is  heard  through  its  elected  representatives.    To  transfer  sovereignty 
<br/>elsewhere,  as  Section  131(2)  of  the  2013  Constitution  does,  is  repugnant  to  democratic  norms.  
<br/>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  constrained  by  the  very  provisions  of  the  Constitution  that 
<br/>provides the constitutional conditions to allow review of it.  There is a binding constraint on us which 
<br/>means that we must follow the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am of the view that there is a need to redefine the constitutional 
<br/>role of the RFMF to allow it to focus on its core roles of defending a sovereignty as well as participate 
<br/>in nation building tasks.  To be peace ambassadors to the world from Fiji in peace support operations 
<br/>with the most professional of officers and men.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  point  I  am  making  is  that  the  role  of  the  RFMF  must  be  clearly  defined  in  our 
<br/>Constitution.  Doing  so  is  the  first  step  to  modernizing  the  military.    As  it  stands,  Section  131(2) 
<br/>leaves the door open for unwelcome military intervention in politics.  Democracy demands that the 
<br/>door remains closed.  If this Parliament is truly representative of the people, then it must reflect the 
<br/>will of the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  sake  of  Fiji’s  future,  I  appeal  to  both  sides  of  Parliament  to  support  the 
<br/>democratisation  of  our  institutions.  We  must  consolidate  democracy  at  all  levels  and  society. 
<br/>Democracy should be the only game in town. There should be no autocracy.  We have just had 16 
<br/>years of authoritarian rule and the people have spoken. They do not want any more of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, I would like to thank the officers and men from the RFMF for providing Fiji 
<br/>with a secure and firm base for the smooth transfer of power after the 2022 General Elections where 
<br/>the people of Fiji resoundingly echoed their voices - renouncing autocracy and endorsing a change 
<br/>to genuine democracy.   I also thank the officers, men and women of the RFMF for their courage and 
<br/>fortitude in upholding and respecting the will of the Fijian people at the polls, and for the rule of law 
<br/>for which I am most grateful, and the people of Fiji are most grateful to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the review we propose is still in its conceptual stage at the moment, but we are 
<br/>working through it.  I will be announcing more details as we firm up on several issues before us.  
<br/>Once  completed  I  intend  to  have  the  published  Defence  Review  presented  to  Parliament  as  a 
<br/>Parliamentary Paper before the end of the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is still deep-seated fear of the Fiji Police.  Many of our people see the Fiji 
<br/>Police Force as an agent as repression.  Rogue and ill-disciplined elements within the Fiji Police have 
<br/></span><span>tarnished their collective reputation.  We need to overcome that and that is why I have reiterated that 
<br/></span><span>we need to keep the Fiji Police Force blue, and true blue at that. We want the Fiji Police Force to live 
<br/>by their moto “Salus Populi” - in the service of the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FPF should report to the law and to the law alone, Mr. Speaker.  We can do this through 
<br/>improved discipline, training and leadership.  The leadership of the Force has changed for the better.  
<br/>We expect the new leadership to improve on the training and the discipline of the police force. The

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>241 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people of Fiji demand that they do so and we expect no less. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am 56 year old today and 37 of these years I have faithfully served Fiji and 
<br/>the Fijian people.   In 1985 I started my service to Fiji as an apprentice in the then Ministry of Fijian 
<br/>Affairs and later in the Judicial Department. I joined the RFMF in 1988 until 2007 when I joined the 
<br/>Public Service.  In 2014 I was elected to Parliament and to date I remain. Throughout this time I have 
<br/>witnessed our political  calamities and how  Fiji  has continued to  go backward because politicians 
<br/>have continuously exploited the RFMF for their political mileage and benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I was at QBE in 2000 and was shot at, like many others during their attempted 
<br/>mutiny of 2</span><span>nd</span><span> November.  It was a terrible and evil event.  People died and more were injured.   I 
<br/>went through that.  I want to share with you also, Mr. Speaker, another event that occurred in my life 
<br/>and set the way I value human lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1996, I was serving in the 1</span><span>st</span><span> Battalion on the Fiji Infantry Regiment in South Lebanon.   
<br/>During this time, I was the Adjutant and side Commander for the Fiji Batallion Head Quarters in 
<br/>Qana.  Whilst there on 8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 1996, I made a drastic decision during a state of war in </span><span>Operation 
<br/>Grapes of Wrath</span><span> to provide refuge to over 500 men, women and children who were displaced from 
<br/>their  homes  because  of  the  war  between  Israel  and  Lebanon.    In  my  effort  to  protect  these  men, 
<br/>women and children, I failed badly, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The IDF, whilst retaliating to armed elements that were firing Katyusha rockets into Israel, 
<br/>lifted and traversed the artillery fire and bombarded our location where the refugees were protected.  
<br/>More than 300 men, women and children died as a result.  Hundreds more were seriously wounded, 
<br/>including four officers and men and under my care.  All under my watch, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have 
<br/>witnessed death and war and I do not like it to happen here, nor for my children or in our home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  lived  through  </span><span>coups  </span><span>after  </span><span>coups  </span><span>in  Fiji,  and  I  want  to  tell  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament and our Fijian people, no more </span><span>coups. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I will stand to answer to history and to God for the loss of lives 
<br/>from the misuse of military power in Fiji and abroad at the time when I was in a position of influence 
<br/>and of leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I oppose this strongly because parents die and children become orphaned.  
<br/>No more pleas, Mr. Speaker, no more.  We must free our children and this stranglehold, and help 
<br/>them to build their future in Fiji, a nation of peaceful people where the rule of law is upheld, where 
<br/>all our human rights are protected and all Fijians are equal, and democracy is our way of life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your indulgence and I thank, once again, the people of Fiji 
<br/>for their patience.  Once again, may I reaffirm my support and thanks His Excellency the President 
<br/>for his most gracious Address.  I thank you.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also want to make a special mention to two of my lovely aunties, who

<div><span>Lastly, Sir, to my voters who voted me in here, in Fiji and abroad, thank you very much for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now as I turn to my reply to the Address from His Excellency the President, 
<br/>I thank and support His Excellency the President’s most gracious Address on the Opening of the 
<br/>2023-2024 Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to reiterate the acknowledgement rendered by the honourable Minister for Home 
<br/>Affairs and Immigration to the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Fiji Police Force in working 
<br/>together to maintain the safety, stability, security, defence and well-being of Fiji and all Fijians, not 
<br/>forgetting those serving in peacekeeping duties around the world, thank you to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, 
<br/>allow me to speak on behalf of the work of the Fiji Immigration Department, which is now part of 
<br/>the Ministry of Home Affairs and my aligned portfolio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  all  are  aware,  Government  is  responsible  for  the  managing  and 
<br/>protecting of Fiji’s borders and ensuring the legal and orderly flow of people in and out of the country.  
<br/>In my first few weeks in Government,  I have had the opportunity to visit Immigration Offices in 
<br/>Fiji’s  Central  and  Western  Divisions,  and  I  thank  the  Management  Team  and  staff  for  their 
<br/>continuous effort in protecting the integrity and security of our borders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also noted with great concern the tremendous resource constraints faced 
<br/>by our frontline teams and the Department as a whole. I am humbled that Officials have expressed 
<br/>their  sincere  appreciation  that  a  Minister,  even  though  Assistant  Minister,  can  now  hear  their 
<br/>concerns directly.  This has been an opportunity that these Officials have not been afforded in quite 
<br/>a while.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  assure  the  people  of  Fiji  and  likewise,  the  Director  of  Immigration,  Senior 
<br/>Management of Immigration and Officials of the Fiji Immigration Department that I will fight for 
<br/>you and your concerns.  I want to reassure the teams on the ground that the issues and concerns raised 
<br/>have been consolidated by my team and I have prioritised them accordingly and will begin the process 
<br/></span><span>of addressing them one by one where possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  my  very  first  priorities  as  Assistant  Minister  responsible  for 
<br/>Immigration,  is  to  commence  work  on  the  relocation  of  the  Fiji  Immigration  Department 
<br/>Headquarters, which is in a very poor condition.  For far too long, the Department Headquarters has 
<br/>been operating from a building that does not meet the safety requirements of the Health and Safety

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Work Act.  It is anticipated that this new site will address the compliance work safety standard to 
<br/>accommodate our public at large.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  this  Parliamentary  term,  Government  will  look  to  progress  the  work  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reviewing the following legislations, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immigration Act 2003; 
<br/>Immigration Regulation 2007; 
<br/>Registration of Skilled Professionals Act 2016; and  
<br/>Citizenship Act 2009. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government intends to undertake extensive public 
<br/>consultation to solicit the views of the people of Fiji before any such Bill is tabled in this august 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government will prioritise capability development improvements for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our Immigration Officials, and this includes the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of the Migration international Data Analyst System (MIDAS); 
<br/>Establishment of Border Immigration Fusion Centre; and 
<br/> Installation of additional closed-circuit television cameras at strategic spots to enable the 
<br/>Department to improve its monitoring and surveillance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  has  been  an  initiative  in  which  financial  assistance  had  been  made 
<br/>available to the previous administration by the United Nations Development Programme, but it is 
<br/>unfortunate  that  the  lack  of  political  will  placed  on  our  national  border  security  has  delayed  the 
<br/>progression of this project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department will also progress with the digitisation initiatives.  This will 
<br/>be rolled out through a dedicated online application lodgment platform for permit and visa lodgments.  
<br/>Moreover, due to the lack of redundancy available for immigration records and files, we anticipate 
<br/>moving towards electronic storage of files and documents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, 
<br/>enhancing and upgrading Fiji’s border will be a priority.  The global COVID-19 pandemic shocked 
<br/>the world and no other country was prepared to manage health issues at its ports of entry.  As such, 
<br/>the Government will walk the talk and work towards positioning our borders to a state of pandemic 
<br/>readiness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A more streamlined and coordinated border management approach will drive this vision.  I 
<br/>believe that we can greatly support Fiji’s largest economic sector  - tourism, by ensuring safe and 
<br/>secure borders.  To that end, border security upgrade plans are already underway for the efficient 
<br/>facilitation of passengers and to ensure seamless travel for those visiting our shores.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji as the connectivity hub for the region has enjoyed significant benefits.  
<br/></span><span>However, this has also come with negative impacts as it has meant that we have to also become a 
<br/></span><span>source, destination and more importantly the transit point for transnational border activities.  For this 
<br/>reason, technological advancement and digitization of services enhances Fiji’s capability for early 
<br/>detection work at the borders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, a coordinated approach by all our border agencies including the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>Military Forces, Fiji Police force, Fiji Revenue and Custom Services, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji,

<div><span>Air and Seaport Terminal operators and Ministry of Health and Medical Services will be established 
<br/>to support this seamless facilitation vision and security at our main ports of entry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  plans  for  upgrading  and  enhancement  are  made  possible  by  our 
<br/>development partners which cushion the financial impact to government coffers, and I would like to 
<br/>acknowledge the assistance and continued support of our  existing  bilateral  development  partners.  
<br/>However, we look forward to engaging with new development partners for the continued upgrade 
<br/>and enhancement of our border management and security.  The Fiji Immigration Department will 
<br/>certainly make progressive changes and modernise Fiji’s border through the timely assistance of our 
<br/>partners.  Let me say at this juncture that exciting times lie ahead of us as Fiji and visitors can look 
<br/>forward to modernised, effective and efficient immigration services at our borders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of our international obligations, Fiji has ratified the UN Convention 
<br/>relating to the Status of Refugees, the UN Convention on statelessness and the UN Convention on 
<br/>the Protection of rights of all migrant workers and members of their families.  These Conventions 
<br/>guide how we respond  to  large-scale movements  and displacements such as  refugees and asylum 
<br/>seekers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To map our responses, we need to understand the evolving migration trends to determine the 
<br/>quality of data and develop an informative analysis. This year with the assistance of the International 
<br/>Organisations of Migration (IOM) the framework for a migration policy and strategy for Fiji will be 
<br/>formulated in consultation with our key stakeholders from the Government and other sectors at large.  
<br/>A migration policy for Fiji will be prioritised as we recognise that managing migration will become 
<br/>a complex issue which would require a truly whole of government approach and multi-sectoral efforts 
<br/>towards facilitating safe, orderly and regular migration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week I had the opportunity to meet with officials from 
<br/>Amnesty International where we discussed a number of concerns that the organisation had published 
<br/>in its 2022 Global Report.  Amnesty International raised a number of issues at the consultation which 
<br/>falls within the ambit of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration concerning the Gestapo-style 
<br/>use of the Public Order Act, Immigration Act 2003 and other laws to target and silence government 
<br/>critics.  This included the expulsion from Fiji of USP Vice Chancellor Mr. Pal Alluwahlia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was glad Mr. Speaker, Sir, to reassure the team from Amnesty International that the winds 
<br/>of  change  are  here  and  that  government  will  act  swiftly  to  reverse  the  discriminatory  and 
<br/>undemocratic decisions taken by the previous administrations. In the past week, we have seen the 
<br/>joyous  celebration  in  Nadi  Airport  welcoming  the  USP  Vice  Chancellor  and  likewise  freedom 
<br/>fighters who have had to resettle overseas in fear of being persecuted in Fiji are already returning to 
<br/>their homeland. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing I wish to reiterate to this august Parliament and the people of Fiji 
<br/>my commitment that during my tenure as the Assistant Minister responsible for Immigration, I will 
<br/>do my  utmost  best  to  ensure that  immigration policies and regulations are implemented with  due 
<br/>consideration to the rights of individuals under the 2013 Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the security of our borders is maintained and enhanced, I invite 
<br/></span><span>member of the other side of the Parliament along with the relevant stakeholders to work together to 
<br/>ensure the safety and security of Fiji, all Fijians and visitors to our beloved nation.  I am currently 
<br/>working  with  my  team  to  promote  the  essence  of  unity  and  to  collaborate  across  border  security 
<br/>stakeholders  and  international  counterparts  to  maintain  fairness  and  justice  within  the  national 
<br/>security jurisdiction.
