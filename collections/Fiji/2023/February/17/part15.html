<div><span>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a matter of privilege was raised with you 
<br/>as  Speaker  of  Parliament  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  134(1)  on  the  afternoon  of  Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>February, 2023.  You, Sir, as honourable Speaker, after reviewing the complaint as well as the </span><span>Daily 
<br/>Hansard  </span><span>for  Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023,  believed  there  was  cause  to  refer  the  matter  to  the 
<br/>Privileges Committee for consideration on Wednesday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Privileges Committee was given a timeline to report back to Parliament today, Friday 
<br/>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.  The Privileges Committee agreed with the Committee’s terms of reference and 
<br/>this is attached as Appendix 1.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, by resolution, decided to conduct the inquiry into the said matter by calling 
<br/>the responsible parties, the honourable Pio Tikoduadua being the complainant and the Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, the honourable Josaia Bainimarama, the respondent.  The Committee noted that during 
<br/>the debate on His Excellency the President’s Address, the honourable Leader of the Opposition made 
<br/>certain comments that honourable Pio Tikoduadua deemed denigrating and humiliating to the Head 
<br/>of State, His Excellency the President and also as Commander in Chief, while appealing to the rank 
<br/>and file in the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) which he communicated to the honourable 
<br/>Speaker,  as  he  felt  were  highly  seditious  and  disrespectful  while  dishonouring  the  dignity  and 
<br/>bringing Parliament into disrepute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament is an independent arm of the State which is fully entitled to take such measures it 
<br/>deems  fit  to  maintain  its  integrity  and  decorum.  The  Constitution  and  the  Standing  Orders  of 
<br/>Parliament are very clear in that the control and the administration of the parliamentary precincts is 
<br/>vested with the Speaker.  The honourable Speaker has the authority to maintain order and decorum 
<br/>to secure and maintain the honour and dignity of Parliament and to act for any breach of privilege or 
<br/>contempt of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having considered the complaint raised as well as reviewed the Uncorrected </span><span>Daily Hansard 
<br/></span><span>for  Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023,  the  honourable  Speaker,  yourself,  Sir,  under  Standing  Order 
<br/></span><span>134(2)(a)  referred  the  alleged  matter  of  breach  of  privilege  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  for  words  allegedly  uttered  during  his  speech  on  Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023.    This 
<br/>Report  differs  from  those  of  Standing  Committees  in  that  the  proceedings  were  held  in-camera, 
<br/>Minutes  and  most  of  the  other  written  documentations  generated  remained  confidential  and, 
<br/>therefore, do not form part of this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  all  honourable  Members  of  the  Committee  for  their  hard  work  and  determination 
<br/>shown and respectfully submit and commend this Report to Parliament.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those 
<br/></span><span>words and on behalf of the Privileges Committee, I now commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, hand the report to the Secretary-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General to Parliament)
