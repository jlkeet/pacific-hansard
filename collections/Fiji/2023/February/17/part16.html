<div><span>BREACH OF PRIVILEGE - HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, having 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>received the Report of the Privileges Committee, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Josaia Bainimarama be suspended from Parliament for three years effective 
<br/>immediately to be served until 17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2026; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>honourable Josaia Bainimarama issue a written apology to His Excellency the President 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within 14 days from today - 17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023; 
<br/>honourable Josaia Bainimarama issue an apology to the public within 48 hours from today, 
<br/>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>during the period of suspension, honourable Josaia Bainimarama is not allowed to enter the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliamentary precincts; and 
<br/>if honourable Josaia Bainimarama fails to comply necessary enforcement measures must 
<br/>be imposed to ensure compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Having received the Report 
<br/></span><span>of the Privileges Committee, Mr. Speaker, I stand here as a member of the Privileges Committee to 
<br/>support the Report tabled by the Chairperson, the honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua  the matter of 
<br/>privilege that was referred by your good self, Mr. Speaker, for the consideration of the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  ruling  you  made  to  refer  this  matter  to  the  Privileges  Committee  is 
<br/>commendable as it shows to the world that democracy is alive and well in this country.  It is the 
<br/>embodiment of integrity and decorum in Parliament, and this is why the Parliamentary democracy 
<br/>works to enable the mechanism of Parliament to work in respect of the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to inform honourable Members that both, honourable Tikoduadua and the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Josaia Bainimarama, attended the hearings of the Privileges 
<br/>Committee when they were summoned, and were fully cooperative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker and honourable Members, at this juncture I wish to advise that the Members of 
<br/>the Committee completed their deliberations, after which honourable Members who had dissenting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>334 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>views gave their opinions.  Then we took a vote, and it was agreed that we will present this Report 
<br/>to Parliament with the recommendations of the three honourable Members who were in agreement, 
<br/>and two against.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members agreed by vote that there was a breach and a need to staunchly protect 
<br/>the sanctity and decorum of Parliament, being the representative body of all Fijians.  There is a need 
<br/>to  strengthen  the  instrument  of  Parliament  and  take  serious  measures  to  protect  the  dignity  and 
<br/>supremeness of the legislature.  When pursuant to Standing Order 62(3), His Excellency has been 
<br/>denigrated (which should not happen) as he is the embodiment of the State and under Standing Order 
<br/>62(4)(c), seditious words were uttered that breached the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, matters of offensive conduct towards Parliament must be taken seriously.  
<br/>It is even more important that Members of Parliament uphold the required standard of behaviour in 
<br/>Parliament.  In particular, the prohibition against speaking words that are disrespectful to our Head 
<br/>of State as well as seditious words that breach the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the above, the Privileges Committee has recommended actions to be 
<br/>taken, we request honourable Members to consider the recommendations as put forward.  I commend 
<br/>the Motion to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>honourable Members may speak for up to 20 minutes.  At the end of the debate, I will then ask the 
<br/>mover of the motion to provide her Right of Reply.  The floor is open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Maharaj, I am addressing you honourable Member.  Do you want to speak, you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stood up and you sat down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order being that we have just received this Report and 
<br/>from the Opposition side, we would like to go on a break so that we can deliberate on the Report and 
<br/>come back to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Member  for  your  Point  of  Order.  I  have  since 
<br/></span><span>decided that we can just sit and go along, and you read it in your good time.  The Report is not that 
<br/></span><span>big, it is not that thick and we all understand the content, so we will move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion this afternoon.  At 
<br/>the forefront, I would like to mention that while parliamentary privilege is the sum of certain rights 
<br/>enjoyed by Members of the Parliament, it is necessary to allow Members of Parliament to discharge 
<br/>their duties to be the voice of the people in the legislature.  The privilege of Parliament granted in 
<br/>regard  to  public  service  must  not  be  used  for  the  detriment  of  our  national  interest  or  for  the 
<br/>advancement of personal interest and agendas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2015 there have been four instances where Members of Parliament 
<br/>have been referred to the Privilege Committee for breaches of parliamentary privilege.   I will now 
<br/>briefly speak on these matters that were referred to the Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first case was against you whilst you were a Member of SODELPA in 
<br/>2015.    The  then  Government  referred  yourself  (when  you  were  a  Member  of  Opposition)  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>335 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Privileges Committee for references uttered outside Parliament directed to the honourable Speaker.  
<br/>It was noted by the Privileges Committee that a reflection on the Speaker is a question of privilege, 
<br/>and such instances amount  to  contempt  which must be dealt with  by Parliament.   Further, it was 
<br/>regarded  as  a  well-established  parliamentary  principle  that  reflections  on  the  Speaker  inside  or 
<br/>outside Parliament are </span><span>inter alia</span><span> and regarded as contempt of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Privileges  Committee  also  noted  that  the  Office  of  the  Speaker  of 
<br/>Parliament is an independent or highly esteemed office under Section 77 of the Constitution of the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji which states amongst other things, that the Speaker serves to secure the honour and 
<br/>dignity of the Parliament hence an attack against the Speaker is an attack against the institution of 
<br/>Parliament as a whole.   As a result of the findings and recommendations of the Privileges Committee 
<br/>as you would recall, a period of suspension of two years was imposed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second case was against the former honourable Tupou Draunidalo.  In 2016, the former 
<br/>honourable Tupou Draunidalo was referred to the Privileges Committee for making reference to the 
<br/>words, “fool”,  “dumb natives” and “you idiot” in Parliament.  The Privileges Committee deliberated 
<br/>on the facts pursuant to Standing Order 62(4)(a)(b)(c) and (d).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the preliminary meeting of the Committee on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> June, 2016, there was a discussion within 
<br/>the  Committee  as  an  composition  of  its  membership.    Following  discussions,  the  honourable 
<br/>Opposition Members refrained from attending the Committee deliberations, leaving the Committee 
<br/>to only comprise the Government side.  This Committee invited former honourable Draunidalo to 
<br/>present her views, but she chose to exercise her right of silence saying that she believed she would 
<br/>not receive a fair hearing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommended that the former honourable Draunidalo be suspended for the 
<br/>rest of the term of Parliament with immediate effect from 6</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2016 and during the period of 
<br/>suspension  she  was  not  allowed  to  enter  parliamentary  precincts  or  the  Opposition  Office.    This 
<br/>would be in excess of two years since her Parliamentary term ended in September 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  third  case  was  against  the  former  honourable  Ratu  Isoa  Tikoca  who  was  elected  to 
<br/>Parliament in September 2014 and was an Opposition Member for SODELPA.  On 5</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2016, 
<br/>the then honourable Tikoca made certain statements in Parliament which selectively targeted Fijians 
<br/>of Muslim faith.  He also named some Arab countries in reference to the use of the name of Ministry 
<br/>of Economy and also named some Muslim officials serving in the State offices and used words such 
<br/>“your kind” and “this elite group” during his speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He was referred to the Privileges Committee for investigation.  Following investigation and 
<br/>hearing of the matter (majority Members of the Committee which comprised honourable Government 
<br/>Members of Parliament) for a serious breach of privileges as well as contempt of Parliament.   They 
<br/>recommended  that  the  then  honourable  Ratu  Tikoca  be  suspended  for  the  rest  of  the  term  of 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Committee  went  further  in  saying  that  “the  Members  freedom  of  speech  had  been 
<br/>affected by its decision”.  The words of the former honourable Ratu Tikoca, although touching on 
<br/></span><span>sensitive societal matters fall within the rights of freedom of expression.  Following his suspension, 
<br/></span><span>Ratu Tikoca instituted judicial review proceedings in the High Court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After leave was given, the Attorney-General’s Chambers filed a summons seeking to strike 
<br/>out the proceedings.  The trial judge was Justice Senaratne said that he was bound by the Court of 
<br/>Appeal decision of Madhavan</span><span> v Falvey &amp; Others</span><span>.  He decided to follow suit and ruled that the Court 
<br/>will not interfere with the internal proceedings of Parliament.  He summed up by saying, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>336 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If the Court starts interfering with the internal affairs of the Parliament it will open 
<br/>floodgates for Members  to  challenge  any resolution  passed by the Parliament in  court 
<br/>which  will  lead  to  a  situation,  where  the  Judiciary  will,  virtually,  be  controlling  the 
<br/>internal affairs of the Parliament and the entire system of  administration for the country 
<br/>can collapse in no time.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the trial judge struck off the application on the ground that the Court lacked 
<br/>jurisdiction to determine the case.  I will staunchly defend the values which the Office of the President 
<br/>embodies to our people.  They do not need to be defended.  They speak for themselves.  These values 
<br/>have given our people confidence and strength.  They have gone to the spirit of our people more than 
<br/>can be appreciated in this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am here to denounce two evils which is a malice to our society, to this nation and must not 
<br/>be allowed in this august Parliament.  These are hatred and ignorance.  These are the forces behind 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s speech in Parliament on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>accused His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji of failing to protect the 2013 Constitution 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji and the rule of law.  On any measure, these are shocking claims.  They should 
<br/>never have been made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allegations are totally without any merit, and I condemn them in the strongest possible 
<br/>terms.  Coming  from  a  former  Prime  Minister,  they  are  both  disgraceful  and  contemptable  and 
<br/>unworthy of a Member of Parliament - unworthy of someone who has led this country in the past and 
<br/>now as honourable Leader of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He shows a complete lack of respect for the person and the Office of the President.  The attack 
<br/>on His Excellency the President’s integrity is  unprecedented  and despicable.  They  amount to  an 
<br/>allegation that His Excellency the President has  forgone and violated his  Oath  of Office to  obey, 
<br/>observe, uphold and maintain the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  assuming  office,  His  Excellency  the  President,  despite  his  past 
<br/>political allegiance, has carried out his constitutional duties with complete probity and impartiality.  
<br/>The Constitution makes it clear that His Excellency the President acts only on the advice of Cabinet 
<br/>or  a  Minister.    His  Excellency  the  President  has  been  faithfully  discharging  his  constitutional 
<br/>obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition has impinged on the conduct of 
<br/>His Excellency the President and calling to question his fitness to occupy that high Office as Head 
<br/>of State.  To impugn on the President’s character, knowing that he had no right of reply, is an act of 
<br/>cowardice  or  an  act  of  a  bully.    If  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  were  to  repeat  his 
<br/>comments outside Parliament, he would be inviting an action for the affirmation against himself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 62(3) states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  conduct  of  members,  the  President,  the  Chief  Justice  (performing  the 
<br/></span><span>functions of the office of President under section 88 of the Constitution), members of 
<br/>the judiciary, or other persons acting in a judicial capacity must not be raised, except on 
<br/>a motion with notice introduced with the Speaker’s permission…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in honourable Draunidalo’s matter for uttering words “dumb natives” and 
<br/>“idiot” in Parliament, she was suspended for the rest of her term as a Member of Parliament.  In your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>
<div><span>337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for making derogatory statements against the then Speaker of Parliament, you 
<br/>were suspended from Parliament for two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of this, having regard for the gravity of the Leader of the Opposition’s conduct, this 
<br/>has been the second instance where he is found to have breached parliamentary privilege. As the 
<br/>deterrence and denouncement of his behaviour, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, a higher 
<br/>sanction is thus recommended.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the words of the former Attorney-General on 21</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2015, in support of the motion to 
<br/>debate on the report of the Privileges Committee regarding the breach of privilege by honourable 
<br/>Lalabalavu, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If you want to attack a judge, irrespective of whether they like the ruling of the judge 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or not, you will be held in contempt of Court.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the former Attorney-General himself said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“No  Member,  however,  is  allowed  to  attack  the  Speaker  because  the  Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>represents the third of one of the three arms of the State, which is the legislature.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the same way, you do not make an attack on His Excellency the President.  
<br/>What Parliament witnessed on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, strongly indicates that the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  breached  Standing  Orders  and  I,  therefore,  support  the 
<br/>recommendations made by Privilege Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  have  been  given  a  list  by  Government  that  they  have  another  two 
<br/>Members,  that  is,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Gavoka  and  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister Professor Prasad.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  in  support  of  the  Report  and 
<br/>recommendations  by the Privileges Committee.  I was saddened by the speech of the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  in  Parliament  on  Monday,  13</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023,  where  he  accused  His 
<br/>Excellency the President for failing to protect the Constitution and the rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the President is not immune from criticism, when such criticism is based on obvious 
<br/>distortion of gross misstatement, it becomes an insult against the President.  Such ignorant insults 
<br/></span><span>can destroy public confidence in the Office of the President.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members of this august Parliament must have regard to the constitutionality of 
<br/>the President’s critical role.  His Excellency is the Head of State and in whom the Constitution vests 
<br/>the State’s executive authority.  I am mindful, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I stand here today that the people 
<br/>of Caumatalevu throughout Fiji and all over, their prayers and thoughts are with His Excellency the 
<br/>President being a paramount chief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the President has been dragged to the lowest point of discredit. What is graver 
<br/></span><span>is that His Excellency does not have the right to respond to these unmeritorious and offensive words 
<br/></span><span>uttered against him and the Office of the President in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  situation  presents  an  opportunity  for  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament to create history by making a stand against ignorance.  Therefore, I call upon honourable 
<br/>Members of this Parliament to defend the values which the Office of the President embodies, and to 
<br/>further denounce the ignorance that the honourable Leader of the Opposition has spurred in his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>338 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speech in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The President is sworn to maintain and preserve the Constitution and the laws of Fiji.  The 
<br/>President is sworn to protect and promote the rights of all Fijians.  The President, therefore, holds the 
<br/>ultimate trust of the people.  This is the oath His Excellency has taken since assuming Office and it 
<br/>is not just a formality but a fundamental value in a State where the rule of law is observed.  These 
<br/>values have given our people confidence and strength.  They have done more to our people’s spirit 
<br/>that can be appreciated in this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The protection of the integrity of the Office of the President and the President is reflected in 
<br/>the rules of this august Parliament.  Standing Order 62(2) prohibits the President’s name from being 
<br/>introduced to influence Parliament or any Committee.  In furtherance of the recognition, Standing 
<br/>Order 62(3) requires that the conduct of the President must not be raised, except on a motion with 
<br/>notice introduced with the Speaker’s permission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In essence, the President is the most important among public servants.  His Excellency should 
<br/>be supported to the degree warranted by his good conduct and efficiency.  The President should be 
<br/>able  to  perform  his  constitutional  duties  without  being  distracted  by  these  unprecedented  and 
<br/>despicable attacks.  You bear the responsibility for your stand before history, I am taking mine, and 
<br/>I must remind honourable Members of this august Parliament that our people will never forget what 
<br/>stand you take. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you already had four precedents in this Parliament that have decided that a 
<br/>breach of privilege committed inside or outside of Parliament warrants suspension from Parliament.  
<br/>In this case, where a former Prime Minister of this country and Leader of the Opposition, who has 
<br/>breached parliamentary privilege, there is much expected from him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We strongly recommend that we follow the precedence that had been set. If we do not, what 
<br/>example are we setting for our young and emerging generation?  Our children and youth should not 
<br/>be  exposed  to  this  type  of  denigration  and  to  see  that  we,  as  representatives  of  the  people,  are 
<br/>accepting this as a norm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also this big lie that the people of Fiji live in fear and are unhappy 
<br/>which is told over and over again. This big lie can get credence. We see the Military been fed this 
<br/>big lie.  We know the master of the big lie. His name was Joseph Gobles, Hitler’s propaganda minister 
<br/>and we know what he did to the German people.  We must stop the big lie. It is emanating from the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition in a manner that is seditious.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  not  condone  such  utterances  and  behaviour,  especially  from  a 
<br/>senior Member of this Parliament, someone of such public status. We must set the example that is 
<br/>right for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, support a suspension from this Parliament of the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Voreqe Bainimarama in line with the recommendation of the Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not know that he was on zoom.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a very serious matter before Parliament.  We have the honourable 
<br/>Members  of  the  Privileges  Committee  deliberate  on  the  matter  of  privilege  brought  up  by  an 
<br/>honourable Member and honourable Minister of the House. We have the recommendations from the 
<br/>Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as a matter of logic, I would say that the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>does not have or will not get benefit if he apologises to His Excellency the President, or if he issues 
<br/>a public apology within 48 hours so he could rightly say whether I apologised or not, I am still going 
<br/>to be suspended for three years.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Attorney-General has highlighted the number of cases we 
<br/>have had in the past and the various awards given to those offending Members over time.  We have 
<br/>heard  that  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  openly  stated  that  he  does  not  value 
<br/></span><span>matanigasau </span><span>or apologies.  So, if he was forced to do a </span><span>matanigasau</span><span>, he could satisfy this but then 
<br/>for him, there is no benefit, Sir.   Apologise </span><span>se sega, tuba ga.  </span><span>Apologise to the public or not, </span><span>tuba 
<br/>ga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish the Committee had put a proviso that if he elects to apologise, then there would be a 
<br/>reduction in the severity of the award.  I am not a lawyer, Sir, but I think there are certain things that 
<br/>can be taken in mitigation before the Judge awards his sentence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has  highlighted  the  importance  of  dignity  and 
<br/>decorum of Parliament and I contribute to that view.  We must maintain the dignity and decorum of 
<br/>this august Parliament and the language we use must be in-keeping with the status we project to the 
<br/>people who voted us as leaders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I farewelled a former officer on his way back to New York and I told him 
<br/>about the discussion we had outside the Washington Hilton Hotel after a prayer breakfast, where I 
<br/>had promised those who were there - 4,000 to 5000 Kings, Presidents, Prime Ministers and leaders 
<br/>from all over world.  They congregated to pray with the President of the United States where two 
<br/>colleagues from Kosovo had given their testimony about coming together after trying to kill each 
<br/>other in the same sector in the civil war.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  United  Nations  coming  in  and  brokering  a  street  fire  and  then  supervising  general 
<br/>elections, each went to opposite parties and won their seats and sat on opposite sides of Parliament.  
<br/>When they saw each other, one would come and would see the one already in the dining hall during 
<br/>parliamentary session – praying.  They got around to asking him, “I saw you praying”.  One of them 
<br/>was a Muslim and one was a Christian.  He said, “Yes, I pray.  Who do you pray to?”  “I pray to 
<br/>Allah, and you?”  “I pray to God through Jesus.”  They started talking and they decided to agree to 
<br/>just fellowship together in the name of Jesus whom they both knew.  They both understood, they 
<br/>both studied the character, so they became very good friends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They came and that night at the final dinner, they gave their testimony and the person who 
<br/>was supposed to close the dinner did not turn up, so the organisers asked me to close the dinner.  I 
<br/>had not prepared an address but I picked up from where they had left off about coming together in 
<br/>the name of Jesus.  They became great friends and walked across the floor of Parliament to facilitate 
<br/>some of the major decisions that Kosovo had to arrive at to ensure a stable future for the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I told the gathering that night that I was going to come back.  When I heard them using the 
<br/>name “Kosovo’, pronouncing it as Kosovah, I told the gathering that night that we have a Fijian word 
<br/></span><span>“kosova”, which means cross over. And I promised them that night that I was going to cross over 
<br/></span><span>from my side.  All of them knew that I had conducted the </span><span>coup</span><span> in 1987, and I promised them that I 
<br/>would cross over from my side as the aggressor of </span><span>coup</span><span> to the aggrieved.  Some saw me as a victor 
<br/>in the </span><span>coup</span><span> and I promised them that I would cross over from my side as a victor to the other side of 
<br/>the victims.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we met the following morning Phillip told me, “Sir, I hope you can go and do that”.  I

<div><span>came back and did that when Ratu Nailatikau was the President.  I took back to him the </span><span>tabua</span><span> that 
<br/>was presented to me by the Senior Officers in the Army to install me in Ratu Nailatikau’s position.  
<br/>I went down to Home Affairs where Ratu Epeli Ganilau was the Minister for Home Affairs, I took 
<br/>one big </span><span>tabua</span><span> to him too and apologised.  The </span><span>Turaga Bale Na Tui</span><span> Cakau had passed on then and 
<br/>Adi Kainona had also died, so I asked Ratu Epeli Ganilau to, please, pass that to his siblings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That afternoon, I went across to Viseisei in Vuda as the late Ratu Iloilo had gone back to the 
<br/>village  and  was  there  as  Tui  Vuda,  I  also  presented  to  him  one  </span><span>kamunaga</span><span>  as  my  apology, 
<br/></span><span>matanigasau </span><span>or</span><span> soro</span><span> to the </span><span>Vanua </span><span>of Vunisei, Viseisei, Vuda, particularly to the family of the late 
<br/>Dr. Timoci Bavadra, </span><span>Taukei kei Werecakaca</span><span>.  I came back feeling very good and, in the meantime, 
<br/>I went around apologising to people even after people told me stop apologising.  Apologising does 
<br/>not mean much to some people, they think we are wasting our time when we apologise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, His Excellency the President is the </span><span>Turaga Bale Na Tui Macuata</span><span>, you are the </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>Bale Na Tui</span><span> </span><span>Cakau</span><span> and we have heard today the efforts of the Coalition Government to bring back 
<br/>the Bose Levu Vakaturaga (BLV).  It was the BLV that accepted our actions in 1987 and forgave us.  
<br/>That forgiveness became the provisions for immunity in the 1990, then the 1997 Constitution.  It 
<br/>came from the hearts and the soul of the BLV.  It was the motion moved by the late </span><span>Marama Bale 
<br/>Na Roko Tui Dreketi,</span><span> Adi Lady Lala Mara, for them to forgive me and my soldiers - some of whom 
<br/>are here in this Parliament - for what we had done in 1987.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for me personally, apologies and </span><span>veivakaturagataki</span><span> are very important.  Just 
<br/>as I spoke about the language this morning, the importance of one’s own language whether it is Hindi 
<br/>or </span><span>Vosa Vaka Viti</span><span>, they demonstrate they are the heart, they are the essence of the character of a 
<br/>person and a people.  But there is no provision for leniency, for a more lenient award if the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition complies with Sections 71(2) or 71(3) of the Constitution of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji.  For him if he really believes there is no point of apologising, we will confirm to him there is 
<br/>no point in apologising - you apologise or not, you will be suspended anyway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know about procedures at this time whether we can insert or make an amendment to 
<br/>this, or we do not have that power, I do not know, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But I believe that an apology, 
<br/></span><span>veivakaturagataki</span><span> that you have and the </span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata</span><span>, you can be the great chief that 
<br/>you are and exercise that inherent mercy, not required of you by any law.  I am probably a lone voice 
<br/>on this side of Parliament, but I can afford to say that because I have been forgiven many times.  The 
<br/>most serious offence that can be committed in a country is treason, and I was forgiven.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by saying that I fully support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is  a  repeat  offender  for  many  grievous 
<br/>parliamentary assaults in this august Parliament, and many of the honourable Members are aware of 
<br/>that.  What is worse is that in the past, he was kind of cocooned into cotton wool and protected by 
<br/>many State agencies that allowed him to unilaterally crush his opponents, sometimes either lawfully 
<br/>or while skimming around the outer edges of the law.  He was allowed to carry on under a delusion 
<br/>sometimes that he was fully entitled to treat Fiji as if it was his own personal kingdom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  at  a  juncture  today,  that  is  not  going  to  be  like  that.    For  me, 
<br/>personally, it comes as no surprise that right now at the beginning of our substantive parliamentary 
<br/>term, where we are the Coalition Government, and where he has been thrown into the Opposition 
<br/>side by the voters - that is the fact.  It does not matter how many votes he single-handedly received.  
<br/>It does not matter how the Coalition Government with what numbers was formed.    
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact is that we are the Coalition Government, but he wilfully and intentionally signalled 
<br/>in his deplorable speech and I consider that as an abuse of parliamentary privilege of immunity to 
<br/>cause destabilisation, and destroy the sanctity of Parliament to ferment sedition, and appeal for others 
<br/>to actually undermine His Excellency the President, who is an embodiment of unity and peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such cowardly behaviour in weaponising ones’ immunity-laden privileged 
<br/>words, inciting others to do his bidding, is not acceptable.  It is utterly pathetic and a sign of a weak 
<br/>leader.    His  words,  sullying  us  in  these  Chambers  attempted  to  inflame  acts  that  lean  towards 
<br/>criminality, and I think he does that while he sits here like a puppet-master egged on by puppeteers 
<br/>inside his side of Parliament.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just underscores the deviousness, ruthlessness 
<br/>and selfish leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We just heard the honourable Prime Minister’s Right of Reply, in return our honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister who ably leads the Coalition Government genuinely from the heart and I have experienced 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the campaign not only just recently, I campaigned with him in 1999.  
<br/>He has shown the honourable Leader of Opposition nothing but respect, kindness and outstretched 
<br/>hands - just now we heard that.  That is the kind of compassion that our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>is trying to show, and he is genuine about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone around him feels his genuineness about compassion, unity and 
<br/>inclusiveness.    In  return,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  continuously  and  maliciously 
<br/>rebuts these gracious overtures with high-ended arrogance.  When I recall our time sitting on the 
<br/>Opposition side and now observe our honourable Prime Minister's kindness, Sir, it actually moves 
<br/>me because his manner of empathetic compassion is what I had long pleaded the Opposition Leader 
<br/>to do or show as then Prime Minister and to extend to us, in order to move the country forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the honourable Members  sitting there and Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would know on 
<br/>many occasions, I called for bipartisanship, I called for compassion, it never happened and now look 
<br/>where we are today in this Parliament.  I have heard over the last four or five days he and his minions 
<br/>started it across the floor and even today, viciously attack the honourable Prime Minister who, in my 
<br/>view, is a far more honourable and noble Statesman than the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>ever was, evidenced by our Coalition's win and within 100 days, his mastery of bringing the region 
<br/>together, bringing Kiribatis, USP and the continent of India, back into Fiji's embrace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He spitefully maligns you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his speech on Monday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, 
<br/>lying to this august Parliament that our collective desire as the Coalition Government to debate in 
<br/></span><span>our mother tongue and pray as we choose to pray was unilaterally decided upon by yourself when 
<br/></span><span>we all know, Sir, that  it was  resolved by vote in the Business Committee, where he himself was 
<br/>present.  He said in his speech, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We have a Parliament where the Speaker without following the Standing Orders, 
<br/>without  debate,  has  decided  that  parliamentarians  can  speak  in  languages  other  than 
<br/>English and say a Christian prayer excluding those of other faiths - a complete defiance of 
<br/>the Standing Orders and the spirit of the Constitution.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, if you know your Standing Orders as we all should, Standing Order 70 states that the 
<br/></span><span>powers of the Speaker is to maintain order and decorum in Parliament.  The honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition's seditious and treasonous narration undermining His Excellency the President in his 
<br/>Address can only be put down to </span><span>viavialevu</span><span> and </span><span>veibeci</span><span>, or in English, contempt and scorn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is no room for that in this august Parliament. There is no room for this 
<br/>anarchy and chaos to reverberate across Fiji and the globe, treacherously exploiting the entitlement

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>342 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have as Members of Parliament to speak as legislators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  heard  Members  of  Parliament  taking  their  cue  from  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and for the whole week, Mr. Speaker, they did not even have the decency to give us that 
<br/>fact that we are only less than two months old Government.  Within the 100 days, we have done a 
<br/>number of things that no one in the Opposition talked about on how quickly we were able to help 
<br/>students in this country. A genuine help, not before an election but before the school was opening - 
<br/>no one talked about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in case the honourable Leader of the Opposition forgot, he is a legislator first 
<br/>and foremost. He is supposed to be here to help and create laws and ensure that the laws we craft 
<br/>together within the Parliamentary procedures a robust fit for purpose and forward thinking. Instead, 
<br/>he is crushing the very laws he brought in and wants an exemption where he can threaten us and the 
<br/>nation with humility at will.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All the other Members who spoke with the exception of a few, all seem to create this situation 
<br/>that the country is heading towards anarchy.  That is the impression that they are creating. That is 
<br/>what they have been doing. No way, Mr. Speaker! The people of this country know. The people of 
<br/>this country appreciate the new Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This notion that somehow, we owe him and his antics a courtesy or a bow must be put down 
<br/>today,  Mr.  Speaker.    He  pulverised  the  rules  of  Parliamentary  engagement  under  Standing  Order 
<br/>62(3) and (4) that explicitly prohibits us from raising the conduct of His Excellency the President or 
<br/>the Judiciary or persons acting in their judicial capacity, and my two other colleagues pointed that 
<br/>out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Mr. Speaker, he has the ball to lecture us about undermining the Constitution, when the 
<br/>Constitution makes it clear in Section 77 that the Office of the Speaker is independent subject only 
<br/>to this Constitution and any other law and serves to secure the honour and dignity of Parliament. His 
<br/>Excellency the President’s Constitutional role states in Section 81(2) that the President is the Head 
<br/>of State, and the executive authority of the State is vested in the President. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Member  actively  incited  in  this  august  Parliament,  hoping  to  foment  an 
<br/>uprising  among  the  armed  forces  to  disrespect  and  undermine  the  Commander-in-Chief.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that cannot go unchallenged. More specifically when he uses grossly irresponsible language 
<br/>like, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji as Head of State in whom rest 
<br/>the executive authority of the State and who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji Military Forces failed to acknowledge the fact that the very Constitution which he 
<br/>is supposed to uphold is being stripped away almost on a daily basis.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is  the message we are sending out  to  the people of this country, we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sending out to the world what the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I appeal to the rank and file of the RFMF to preserve their manna, to maintain their 
<br/></span><span>credibility  and  calling  and  not  forsake  their  constitutional  role.  I  also  wish  to  inform 
<br/>RFMF and its gift and legacy, the Fijian Constitution is being ignored and abused on a 
<br/>daily basis, and the current Prime Minister wants what the RFMF worked so hard for, 
<br/>removed.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But worst of all, Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition launches a widely contemptuous 
<br/>attack  on  the  Judiciary,  saying  that  we  have  a  Judiciary  where  the  sitting  Chief  Justice  has  been 
<br/>suspended  for  frivolous  matters.    The  constitutional  process  is  being  followed.    Fiji’s  judicial 
<br/>authority and its independence and our role as parliamentarians is clearly set out in Section 97(4) of 
<br/>the Constitution which states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Parliament and Cabinet, through legislative and other measures, must assist and 
<br/>protect  the  courts  to  ensure  their  independence,  impartiality,  accessibility  and 
<br/>effectiveness.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  freedom  of  parliamentary  speech  by  virtue  of  our  privileged  of  legal  immunity  as 
<br/>Members of Parliament that the honourable Leader of the Opposition sought to manipulate comes 
<br/>with the responsibility, it is not an absolute right.  This is why when any of us abuses these freedoms, 
<br/>our own Standing Order Rules evolved from the Westminster genesis of tension between monarchs 
<br/>and Members of Parliament grants us the ability to self-regulate and hold ourselves above reproach 
<br/>to be worthy of honourable Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there can be no other way to put this but to say that the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition wilfully violated his parliamentary privilege as a Member of Parliament to foment 
<br/>an uprising or a </span><span>coup </span><span>using and manipulating our august Parliament and the privileges accorded to 
<br/>him by using seditious and treasonous words that are prohibited references according to the Standing 
<br/>Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  on  seditious  and  treasonous  words  inciting  an  insurrection,  had  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  not  enjoyed  this  parliamentary  privilege  as  he  does  now, 
<br/>according to the Crimes Act 2009 (73) (b), if found guilty of inciting soldiers or police to sedition or 
<br/>to disobey any lawful order by a superior officer, it would earn him a penalty of five years in prison.  
<br/>Such is the gravity of using seditious or treasonable words. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was very clear that the honourable Leader of the Opposition viciously attacked, threatened 
<br/>and scandalised in one single speech the three arms of the State.  If he is permitted to continue in this 
<br/>Parliament,  he  will  do  so  and  raise  the  notch  at  every  opportunity.    Ever  since  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government tried to come together in formation, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and all his 
<br/>sidekicks  unquenched  thirst  for  power  has  actively  tried  to  destabilise  the  will  of  the  people  by 
<br/>inciting communal antagonism since 22</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2022, after that glitch failed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It continues today and I can see it continuing in Parliament with the turnaround in narrative 
<br/></span><span>from the other side all week where they are now the victim agitating to sow discord based on race - 
<br/>shameful.   He cannot be allowed to fester on, Mr. Speaker.  We have been discharged with the solemn 
<br/>constitutional  task  of  protecting  your  high  Office  as  well  as  the  Office  of  the  President  and 
<br/>Commander-in-Chief as well as the Judiciary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  talked  about  the  precedent  but  if  you 
<br/>compare all those three and the gravity of what the honourable Leader of the Opposition has said and 
<br/>what those three honourable Members at that time faced as a result, this is very serious.  We will not 
<br/></span><span>waiver from what the people have sent us to do as our Prime Minister exemplifies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said before, we have a Prime Minister who has openly, publicly showed compassion 
<br/>and humility.  His Right of Reply today was a masterclass of humility, humbleness and trying to work 
<br/>together.  His contribution just now, his stories embody some of those experiences that he has and all 
<br/>he  has  got  from  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  some  honourable  Members  on  the 
<br/>Opposition’s side is hate, scorn, andridicule. He does not deserve that, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in  conclusion,  I want  to  gratefully  acknowledge the  efforts  of the Privileges 
<br/>Committee  and  I  thank  them  for  upholding  the  highest  standards  of  parliamentary  procedure  and 
<br/>practice for the rest of us.  Their report actually reminds us that responsible parliamentarians protect 
<br/>and uphold the integrity and impartiality of these democratic institutions  - ensuring that the three 
<br/>arms of the State have the liberty and latitude to do as the Constitution stipulates without reference 
<br/>of threats.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I support this motion before this august Parliament.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-    Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  comment  on  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament.  We all know it is a matter of privilege.  I have been a Member of Parliament since 2014 
<br/>and at that time we were in the Opposition with most of the honourable Members who now form part 
<br/>of  the  Coalition  Government.    The  first  matter  of  privilege  that  came  during  my  first  tenure  in 
<br/>Parliament was the matter that was against you at that time, Mr. Speaker.  You will recall that night 
<br/>the former honourable Niko Nawaikula and myself were pleading on your behalf for leniency, and 
<br/>also that you could be forgiven.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second case was Tupou Draunidalo’s case and Ratu Isoa Tikoca’s case. I was also part 
<br/>of the Privileges Committee in 2019 when the matter of privilege was raised by the honourable Pio 
<br/>Tikoduadua then against the former honourable Prime Minister.  I was fortunate at that time when 
<br/>the  former  honourable  Prime  Minister  was  part  of  the  Privileges  Committee  with  the  former 
<br/>honourable Adi Liti Qionibaravi.  Given that the former honourable Prime Minister had to recuse 
<br/>himself because he had already made a comment publicly, I was appointed by our Caucus at that 
<br/>time to replace him at the Privileges Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Prime Minister alluded to, something with the Privileges Committee comes 
<br/>down  to  the  recommendations  and  the  vote.  Whatever  will  be  debated  tonight  has  already  been 
<br/>deliberated by the Committee and that will be part of the Hansard report that will be made available 
<br/>later to the honourable Members as an Appendix to the report that is before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue, the guideline and the baseline as the honourable Prime Minister has raised, he has 
<br/>talked about Kosovo and the </span><span>itaukei </span><span>word of “</span><span>kosova</span><span>”.  I would like to thank him in his Right of 
<br/>Reply the motion thanking His Excellency the President’s for his most gracious speech on how we 
<br/>rise  above  the  issues  like  the  most  senior  member  of  Parliament,  and  also  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister now serving his third term in position as Prime Minister.  He talked like a fatherly figure in 
<br/>Parliament when he did his Right of Reply.  He also appealed for a “cross-the-floor” cooperation, in 
<br/>terms of what we used to beg for when we were on the Opposition side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We always sought a bipartisan approach and this is the first sitting of Parliament in this 2023 
<br/></span><span>session, and it was unfortunate that a matter of privilege has come up.  We are in a very important 
<br/>stage of transition.  We have heard from honourable Seruiratu our acceptance on the transition and 
<br/>the change of Government that is there.  We have also heard the honourable Prime Minister in his 
<br/>Right  of  Reply  saying  that  the  Government  will  build  on  from  the  legacy  that  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government has already created, and that is the way forward that I see this Parliament going to - on 
<br/>how we can find solutions for a shared destiny as national leaders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Monday, I had shared a story (but it was not deliberate honourable Members) during His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency the President’s trip to the Vatican.  He was received by Pope Francis in his visit to UK 
<br/></span><span>and also Middle East to see our troops at Golan Heights before going to Great Britain where he met 
<br/>Prince Charles at Norfolk, England at Her Majesty’s residence.  He had sent me a photo and he said 
<br/>that he was with Prince Charles.  That was in July and in the following month, Prince Charles became 
<br/>the King of England.  When he sent me the photo, I replied and said “</span><span>Sota e rua na ‘ai Bolatagane.</span><span>” 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President  replied  and  said,  “</span><span>Sota  e  rua  na  ‘ai  vale.</span><span>”      The 
<br/>meaning I shared on Monday was that two from the same household had met.  That is the moral of

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the story.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I had shared something about that and said that we need to listen to what His Excellency the 
<br/>President  is  not  saying.    What  comes  back  to  me  is  the  story  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>himself.  He had shared to us one day that being the Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs at that 
<br/>time, one of his officers had asked him, given that there were conflicting ideas on various resolutions 
<br/>that needs to be passed through the GCC, "how are you able to bring these chiefs into consensus?”   
<br/>He said, “I told them, for the chiefs, we have to listen to what they are not saying.”  That has been 
<br/>the tool used by the honourable Prime Minster at that time as Chairman of the GCC, on how he used 
<br/>to resolve issues within the GCC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on our way to Suva in 2021, after the COVID-19 crisis when the ban was 
<br/>lifted, we were with His Excellency the President (the </span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata) </span><span>before he was 
<br/>nominated at the airport in Labasa.  He had his bag and I asked him where he was going, and he told 
<br/>me he was going to a Board meeting at Fiji Pine.  He was a Board member at that time.  I told him 
<br/>in the Macuata dialect, “</span><span>sa rui a kisi nomu ‘ato</span><span>” , meaning his bag was too small.   He asked why 
<br/>and I told him, “</span><span>muru sa varau lai tawana na vale boro vulavula</span><span>”, which meant that he was going to 
<br/>occupy the White House here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were seated together on the plane, and I was sharing to him that it was time for some 
<br/>leadership training to prepare his successor as he would probably be elevated to  become Head of 
<br/>State.   When we reached the airport in Nausori and we bid farewell, I told him that if his name came 
<br/>up as a nominee for President, I would vote for him.  He asked if I had heard something and I told 
<br/>him that I had a feeling his name would be put forward for nomination.  I said to him in the Macuata 
<br/>dialect, “e</span><span>sa ‘erei me sa vakatututaki na yacamu, muru cikoma”</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>meaning that if he is approached to 
<br/>be nominated, to accept it.  After few hours at home, he contacted me that he was on his way down 
<br/>to Sigatoka to see his son.  He was intercepted by some officials and was brought to the then Prime 
<br/>Minister’s residence at Muanikau and was approached to be the Prime Minister’s nominee and he 
<br/>had accepted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  gave  me  a  call  that  night  and  told  me,  “</span><span>Mo  oya  na  ‘a  daru  veitalanoata’ina  mai  na 
<br/>waqavu’a sa yaco, oio sa ciqoma, io”</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>meaning that what we were talking about on the plane had 
<br/>come about and he had agreed. “</span><span>O io sa donu, au sa na tio ga nodaru veitalanoa mai na airport”</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>The very next morning, we had the caucus and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at that time you will know that you 
<br/>were the Leader of the Opposition and I had requested that I and the Members of Parliament from 
<br/>Macuata be given the liberty to vote for our Chief that morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were in agreement with honourable Adi Litia but some members of the caucus did not 
<br/>see the wisdom.  I had asked for us from Macuata to vote </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> and not to vote on party lines, 
<br/>but some members of the caucus said that we were members of SODELPA and we should vote for 
<br/>the nominee of the party.  On our way down with you, Sir, you told me something that I will never 
<br/>forget and you said, “</span><span>Mo na vote qo ‘ila ga na Kalou kila oio” - k</span><span>nowing the importance to us in 
<br/>Macuata that our chief was brought up.  The difficulty at that time was what I had raised in caucus 
<br/>but there was some understanding in the end on how I should vote or the action I should take, given 
<br/>the advice by the Leader of the Opposition at that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, back to the motion that is before Parliament, I appeal across the aisle in agreement 
<br/>with  what  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  urged  this  august  Parliament  moving  forward  in  a 
<br/>destination and a new path  that we need to  follow  - a path  of reconciliation.   We have heard the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General on many occasions talking about reconciliation and also other things 
<br/>that needs to be done on some of the things that are attached to our political past.  This could be the 
<br/>start where we can walk and talk across through cooperation.

<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>346 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I appeal to you, Sir, through Standing Order 18 and Standing Order 20 to use the Powers 
<br/>of the Speaker in support of what the honourable Prime Minister has said of how the motion can be 
<br/>amended but the power is vested in you, Sir.  I am appealing to your chiefly inherited powers that is 
<br/>more powerful than the law and also it is in line with the re-establishment of that authority.  “</span><span>Ni 
<br/>kemuni na turaga sa mai vua na Kalou”</span><span> and I think from this afternoon we have learnt that inherited 
<br/>power and merging it with government leadership, those are the things that can move our country 
<br/>forward.  This is the time that is most needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, when I delivered my response to His Excellency the President </span><span>Turaga na Tui 
<br/>Macuata</span><span> when he opened the Parliament Session in 2021, I shared with Parliament what Sir Winston 
<br/>Churchill had said in one of his famous quoted speeches, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“To each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively 
<br/>tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them 
<br/>and  fitted  to  their  talents.  What  a  tragedy  if  that  moment  finds  them  unprepared  or 
<br/>unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cited that in my speech, saying that the </span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata</span><span> is prepared for this 
<br/>finest hour and I think at that time many did not know what God was calling him for.  I had also 
<br/>shared in that speech a time when Sir Winston Churchill had shared that particular quote, the famous 
<br/>attack in London where the Germans had invaded London and there was a famous song at that time 
<br/>that came out when London was facing all those uncertainties and that song was called, “Until the 
<br/>lights of London shine again.” That was translated into the Fijian song, “</span><span>Me yacova ni waqa na cina 
<br/>mai Bolatagane.”</span><span>  I appeal to you, Sir, I think the </span><span>cina</span><span> from </span><span>Bolatagane sa waqa to’a</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- </span><span>Kua ni veiwali tale tiko</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- We need to see that light and that light, again, as being reminded 
<br/>by the honourable Prime Minister, urging Members of this august Parliament and also appealing to 
<br/>your power, Sir, as per Standing Orders 18 and 20 to see a way forward for the betterment of Fiji 
<br/>moving forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I did not realise that I was going to do this very early 
<br/>into my career or my job here in Parliament.  I was scared to come to the last Parliament. I would 
<br/>watch from home and listened to the way attacks and missiles were being thrown at each other and I 
<br/>would say to myself, “Vili, lucky you are not in there.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, this is happening, and we are talking about a person when the offence is all hidden in 
<br/>those words, those words that we are saying that this is seditious or treasonous, which is not as clear 
<br/>cut if it was a swear word it would had been easy to talk about.  It is how you interpret those words 
<br/>that were said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, I shared a story of that lady in Labasa in 2000 and what happened to her and those 
<br/>of you who were here would have heard that story.  When I was telling that story yesterday, the day 
<br/>before  with  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation,  I  knew  she 
<br/></span><span>wrongly said that it was the honourable Leader of Opposition in 2000.  I knew she meant 2006 but 
<br/></span><span>she said in 2000 and I was going to say, “no, he was not the leader, he was the person that stopped 
<br/>this carnage.”  The story that I had told about that lady naked cooking curry for people who were 
<br/>sitting there drinking beer, it is that person that we are talking about today that stood his ground and 
<br/>we gradually moved back into where we are today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hear the honourable Deputy Prime Minister that had just spoken again.  Just adding on into 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that back and forth, the life in this Parliament that I am so scared of when I was outside.  And when 
<br/>we try and interpret the words whether it is seditious or treasonous, I know at the end of the day it 
<br/>comes to the vote. We can say as much as we can over here but at the end of the day, it will come to 
<br/>a vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision in the Committee that had deliberated on this is a three to two Committee. Those 
<br/>that brought up the charges they have more numbers than us and it is how this place sits. At the end 
<br/>of the day, we are going to vote regardless of what we say.  The interpretation of words whether it is 
<br/>seditious or treasonous is so hard to just may be lawyers who do it very easily but for us, for a sailor, 
<br/>captain of a ship, it is so difficult to define and say, “look, that word is treasonous or inciting.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  sharing  with  some  of  my  friends  on  this  side  of  Parliament  the  fact  that  people  are 
<br/>saying, he is inviting the military to do a </span><span>coup</span><span> and I was just sharing with them what I saw that could 
<br/>never ever happen again in Fiji is a </span><span>coup </span><span>because of the Constitution.  That is the way I saw my role 
<br/>when I was Commander RFMF because it says that you can never abrogate the Constitution, you can 
<br/>never form a government outside the way it is supposed to be formed over here.  You cannot come 
<br/>in and do a </span><span>coup </span><span>and get away with it, it is not an option in my view. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was listening to the argument that those words were inciting people in the RFMF and I was 
<br/>just putting my old Commander’s shoes again and said, “did those words incite me?” I said, “no, I 
<br/>know my role and I know what to do.”  I am just wondering when will this end?  When will this back 
<br/>and forth that I think carried on from the last Parliament when we the new kids who are coming in 
<br/>here, if you listen to all the speeches in this Parliament, you hear the tone of those who are coming 
<br/>in new are totally different from those who were here before.  When will this end? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will have to watch my words very carefully every time I speak in this Parliament because I 
<br/>can say one word and you take it and go to the Committee, it is a three to two-vote all the time.  Come 
<br/>back here, vote and throw him out.  I appeal for good sense.  Seditious word is bad, inciting is bad  
<br/>and I am not saying that they should be said but this game that I saw in this Parliament which made 
<br/>me so scared to come in, should end.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just appealing to both sides, as a new Member of Parliament, I hope that we can reshape 
<br/>the way we do our work in this Parliament.  For those of you who were here before, if there were 
<br/>animosities  between  you,  it  should  be  thrown  out  of  this  Parliament,  no  more!    This  is  a  new 
<br/>Parliament, and we go new from here.  I do not know whether that contributes to this motion, but I 
<br/>would like to share my thoughts and the feeling that I feel right now as we debate this motion in this 
<br/></span><span>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I promise that I will be very brief.  Be assured, 
<br/>and, of course, to our friends on the other side of Parliament, we have heard you.  We have heard you 
<br/>and  heard  you  well  and  I  thank  all  those  who  have  spoken  on  the  motion  before  Parliament.  
<br/>Definitely,  it  is  a  serious  business,  we  need  to  maintain  the  high  standards  and  the  decorum  of 
<br/>Parliament, we totally agree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that we welcome the offer by the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span><span>If that is a way forward, that is what I said in my deliberations today.  I did not know why I used that 
<br/></span><span>statement.  We are in a new season, probably this is the beginning of the new season.  The honourable 
<br/>Naupoto was asking, when will this end?  I am asking, when will this start?  And I see this as an 
<br/>opportunity for us to start.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what I am going to ask for, I welcome the recommendation by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  Secondly, it rests on you, Sir, and the Secretary-General based on your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="92">Page 92</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Breach of Privilege – Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>348 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>powers under Standing Orders 18 and 20.  I would plead that this be referred back to the Committee, 
<br/>taking into consideration the amendment that has been proposed, and probably in the next sitting so 
<br/>that  the  Committee  can  come  again  with  the  recommendations  that  has  been  proposed  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have heard the honourable Attorney-General but I would make an extra plea as well, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  Based on Standing Order 127, the Privileges Committee has the same powers as the 
<br/>High  Court.  Sitting  here  today,  this  is  my  plea  to  you  as  well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  fair 
<br/>administration of justice.  We have lawyers in this Parliament, I am a bush lawyer, but this is what I 
<br/>want to say, because this Privileges Committee has the powers equivalent to the High Court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the military when the Court Martial is convened, we have a Judge from the High Court to 
<br/>ensure that the deliberations of the Court Martial is done according to law.  We are politicians here, 
<br/>we know the history of all the disciplinary cases in Parliament and in the fair administration of justice, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on your wisdom, if this is referred back to the Committee and if you allow 
<br/>the Committee to sit with all due respect because according to the Standing Order, the Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, is the Chairperson, I am not sure whether it is correct by law, but in the name of justice like 
<br/>the Military Court Martial, we have someone to direct them and that is the role of a High Court Judge 
<br/>within the Court Martial to ensure that.  Sir, that is justice, that is democracy, that is transparency 
<br/>and that is the way forward, and I leave it with you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no other speakers because my name has been mentioned, my 
<br/>position has been mentioned firstly by the honourable Prime Minister of his experiences, what he has 
<br/>gone through, he sought forgiveness several times from high chiefs around the country and he is just 
<br/>throwing in something that for him, perhaps it is the beginning of a new beginning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But again, let me quote from </span><span>Erskine May</span><span> a quotation made by William Lenthall, the Speaker 
<br/>of the House of Commons of England in 1642.  When King Charles I moved for the impeachment of 
<br/>certain Members of the House and to effect the arrest of William Lenthall because of the Members 
<br/>of Parliament, the Speaker refused and defied the King by saying, “I have neither eyes to see, nor 
<br/>tongue to speak in this place, but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, honourable Members, embodies what the Speaker of Parliament is, that I am here for 
<br/>this august Parliament and you the honourable Members.  I hope we can understand the full effect 
<br/>and meaning of that quotation, as to the role that is now being mentioned because I happen to be 
<br/>wearing a traditional role as well, to see how best this would be outside the Standing Orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not so much the powers that is with the Speaker, as highlighted by honourable Bulitavu 
<br/>under Standing Order 18, but this is something that has already been done in the House of Commons.  
<br/>I hope I have enlightened you, honourable Members, that the role of the Speaker is just to be someone 
<br/>that is a servant of Parliament, and that is embodied in our Standing Orders and we are also part of 
<br/>the tradition that we hold dear to.  Who else will be making the move for unity?  Honourable Penioni, 
<br/>in his Maiden Speech has prayed - we do not change what is there and what is good - just try and 
<br/>improve on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been through this.  Honourable Seruiratu sat on the Privileges Committee, and it is sad.  
<br/></span><span>It is sad, honourable Members, knowing that the Leader of the Opposition who is also a relative of 
<br/>mine, but as honourable Naupoto has asked, when will this come to a halt?  Honourable Seruiratu 
<br/>has  asked,  when  will  this  start?    This  is  a  new  beginning.    It  is  the  55  Members  who  are  in  this 
<br/>Parliament who will be making the decision here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been hard for them, Madam Chairperson of the Privileges Committee, knowing her  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Breach of Privilege - Hon. J.V. Bainimarama   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but it is the 55 who will have to decide on this.  I have been given a note from the Secretary-General, 
<br/>from an honourable Member that if something could be done.  The statement made by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister is true, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I apologised in the newspapers, I apologised by writing a letter to the Madam Speaker then, 
<br/>the late  Dr. Jiko  Luveni,  but  I still went  out  with no pay, not  even to  set  foot in  the precincts  of 
<br/>Parliament.  I came back and I stated in this Parliament when given a chance to speak that I went out 
<br/>like a man and I came back like a man.  It makes you stronger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your service as a parliamentarian or as a politician, once you become one you become one 
<br/>for good, so you are stuck there, honourable Naupoto.  If you are afraid of coming in, you are in now, 
<br/>so at times you have to stand up and make decisions and such a moment is right in front of you, 
<br/>honourable Members.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  hear  so  much  about  praising  the  good  Lord.    I  have  been  blessed  to  be  raised  up  as  a 
<br/>Christian.  I have heard all that but that is an issue that I would like to share and implore on you, 
<br/>honourable Members.  The decision is yours.  I am here as your servant and the decision is yours to 
<br/>decide.  Once the decision is taken, it would be too late to change things because immediately after 
<br/>this, all these come into effect - no more setting foot into the precincts, he loses everything, the pay 
<br/>is out, even though that was done to us but who are we? I may not be speaking for my two former 
<br/>colleagues, honourable Tupou Draunidalo and honourable Isoa Tikoca, but sitting here in the Chair 
<br/>is not easy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I ask, please make a decision.  We have sat late into the night because of the deliberations 
<br/>of the Committee.  I know they are loggerheads because this is something new to them but again, 
<br/>being given this and being mentioned here, this Parliament is pleased to direct me and whose servant 
<br/>I  am  here  for.    Thank  you,  honourable  Members.    Your  right  of  reply,  honourable  Leader  of 
<br/>Government in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to share the findings of the Committee.  We 
<br/>all have a copy, we can refer to it in paragraph 6.0, just to shed some light in light of what has been 
<br/>discussed in Parliament tonight.
