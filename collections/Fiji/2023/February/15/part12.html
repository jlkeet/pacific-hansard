<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- TELS… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- We will not give excuses to our people, but we will deliver what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have promised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- For you only one person decides. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to underscore that there is a critical need to have a separation between 
<br/>the National Government and the Local Government and at the same time, the Local Government’s 
<br/></span><span>vision, mission and objectives must mirror that of the National Government.  The Local Government 
<br/></span><span>at their level are the implementation arm of national policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen that over the years, there is an increased dependence of the Local Government 
<br/>on National Government for funding and decision-making.  Prior to 2014, there were some capital 
<br/>projects funded by the national budget for some municipal councils but in 2014, what used to be a 
<br/>few hundred-thousand-dollars of funding through national budget reached millions of dollars.  It was 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>113 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also  noted that the municipal councils became complacent  and little effort was made to  focus on 
<br/>municipal development plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Wastage, wastage! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  outstanding rates  collection is 
<br/>concerning.  As at January 2023, Councils have yet to collect 31 percent of this financial year’s rates, 
<br/>which is approximately $10.8 million, but arrears from previous years are very low in collection.   The 
<br/>Councils collectively have to collect $63.9 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Go and collect it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Hence, revenue streams need to be strengthened.  In entirety, through 
<br/>the process of preparing for the elections, the Ministry will provide all the Councils with standardised 
<br/>policies, operating procedures, guidelines and manuals.  This is very important, especially with  
<br/>councillors being established after almost two decades. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, the Ministry intends to provide rates amnesty that will 
<br/>provide some relief to the ratepayers who are facing difficulty in paying hefty amounts of interest.  In 
<br/>addition, the Council will have the opportunity to tidy their books and records that will allow them to 
<br/>collect the principal amounts owed by the defaulting ratepayers.  The Ministry realises that the ratepayers 
<br/>need some incentive for paying their rates and as such, the Councils have been prompted to provide the 
<br/>necessary discounts to the ratepayers as deemed just and reasonable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  and  the  Municipal  Councils  will  continue  to  work  towards 
<br/>development in the respective Municipalities in accordance with the budgetary allocations and the set 
<br/>policies for the implementation of infrastructure.  We cannot just leave the councils to fend for themselves 
<br/>all of a sudden.  There are some small councils that may need support to get back on their feet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consultations have been the cornerstone of the People’s Coalition Government’s 
<br/>agenda.  We believe that with consultation and discussion, we will be able to fund better solutions.  Hence, 
<br/>as part of the election’s preparation process, we want the ratepayers, the citizens of each municipality to 
<br/>have a say in the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also ensure that the Councils are engaged with the ratepayers and relevant stakeholders 
<br/>on  the  need  for  capital  developments  in  the  distinct  communities.    We  remain  focused  on  building 
<br/>Municipal Markets for the benefit of all market vendors and consumers alike. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formulation of a Strategic Spatial Master Plan of Viti Levu is in progress 
<br/>with a Conceptual Master Plan of the greater Suva, Nadi and Lautoka areas.  In finalising these master 
<br/>plans, we will involve the people of Fiji and our key stakeholders to have their say and their voices heard, 
<br/>as their input will be critical in our stance of better serving our towns and cities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to commend the National Fire Authority (NFA) for its services 
<br/>in the last 100 years since its establishment in 1922.  The Fire Service has come a long way since then.  
<br/></span><span>In light of this milestone achievement of the fire service, a centennial celebration is being planned to 
<br/></span><span>celebrate this achievement and to remember the many who have contributed towards the growth of the 
<br/>fire service in Fiji since its beginning 100 years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  the  National  Fire  Authority  has,  indeed,  made  an  impact  since  its  humble 
<br/>beginnings.  This Government will continue to support the work of the NFA in providing security for our

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>property and our lives.  We acknowledge the work of the people in the fire service, and we thank them 
<br/>for their continuous service to this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Coalition  Government  is  here,  not  by  default,  but  by  a 
<br/>defined mandate of the people - 58 percent who voted for a change, vote of confidence demonstrated by 
<br/>the  election  of  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  on  the  floor  of  this  Parliament  and  decisions  taken 
<br/>democratically by our respected Coalition partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition are at liberty to live in denial of this fact and wander in the wilderness.  We are 
<br/>least bothered.  The Coalition Government has a duty to serve the people and we will move on to fulfil 
<br/>what  we  have  promised  to  the  people.    Already  52  days  of  happiness  and  freedom  is  far  greater  an 
<br/>achievement to the 16 years of confinement in the guided dictatorship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That being so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our style of governance, leadership, policies, programmes and 
<br/>mode of operation will be in part with the ideals and principles of democratic accountability.  We are the 
<br/>Government of the people, by the people and for the people.  We have grown smarter and greater by the 
<br/>experiences of the past.  We have the mandate of the present and share a vision compatible to the future.  
<br/>This is the era of the Coalition where one must learn to renounce and denounce the politics of connivance 
<br/>and convenience and accept and embrace politics of dialogue and consensus building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the days and nights of the long knives of fear of oppression are gone.  We live in a truly new 
<br/>Fiji today where the guiding dictum of our governance is aptly defined by the immemorial words of the 
<br/>late President Ronald Reagan, and I quote: “The duty of the Government is to serve the people, not to 
<br/>regulate their lives.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.  May God bless 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us all and God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea and when 
<br/>we resume and the bell is sounded, we will invite honourable Semi Koroilavesau to take the floor.  The 
<br/>Parliament is adjourned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.41 a.m.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.16 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, may I join other honourable Members who have 
<br/>congratulated you as being elevated to the position of Speaker of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak in reply to His Excellency’s Address at 
<br/>the opening of the 2023-2024 session of Parliament.  Before I comment further on His Excellency’s 
<br/>Address, please, allow me to thank the people of Fiji that have come out to vote and special thanks to 
<br/>those who voted for FijiFirst making it possible for us to receive the highest vote well above the People’s 
<br/>Alliance-NFP coalition.  In fact, without SODELPA’s support, the situation will be much more different 
<br/>in this Parliament.  Our leader, honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, received the highest vote for all 
<br/>candidates that stood for the General Election in 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  wish  to thank my  wife  -  Joanna, my children  and their  families,  for their 
<br/>unwavering support during the preparation for general election.  I also wish to thank my relatives and 
<br/>friends from all over Fiji who voted for FijiFirst and for me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must admit that I did not campaign but worked all right through except for a 
<br/>few days that I took leave to visit Savusavu for the 100 years birthday celebration of Mrs. Brown, wife 
<br/>of Captain Stan Brown; the founder of today’s Fiji Navy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to, I did not campaign but supported those that worked around 
<br/>Fiji correcting misinformation and lies that have been spread around the country.  With social media 
<br/>access, these conspiracy theories spread like wildfire and supporters of theories continue today and will 
<br/>remain to be a challenge for Fiji in years to come.  I must thank the people of the “</span><span>Veivakararamataki” 
<br/></span><span>team; Timoci Gaunavinaka, Lino Nawai and many youths for their tireless work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The promises and lies made by politicians supported by political parties during this campaign will 
<br/>be a subject that Fiji and Fijians will need to grapple with in years to come.  I wish to thank my families, 
<br/>relatives and friends in Nadi, Yasawa, Kadavu and Fiji wide for their trust and support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  in  his  opening  statement  had  stated  and  highlighted  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>difficulties faced in the last three years and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Mr. Speaker and honourable Members of Parliament, since November 2021 when I 
<br/>last addressed this Parliament our nation was at the tail-end of efforts to address the global 
<br/>pandemic, natural disasters and a period of uncertainty, distress and loss that gripped  our 
<br/>nation”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these challenges were during our FjiFirst Government.  We had recovered and 
<br/>the fact that our growth rate was one of the highest in the last quarter of last year in 2022 is tantamount 
<br/>to this fact.  The People’s Alliance Party Coalition Government in 2023 cannot continue to use the excuse 
<br/>of previous years as that has been dealt with as I have alluded to.  Additionally, His Excellency stated 
<br/>that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The past three years have been indeed a challenge for us all.   As  always,  we  have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>risen to the challenges and demonstrated our resilience as a nation and one people.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally agree with His Excellency but wish to add that it was because of the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government, and its leadership that we were able to successfully steer and navigate our way 
<br/>through the COVID-19 obstacles.  This challenge now is for the PAP Coalition Government to recover

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as the worst has gone and dusted, having being dealt with by the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency emphasised the need to work together and he stated that as we 
<br/>grapple with ongoing and emerging challenges, this august Parliament should embody the collective spirit 
<br/>of resilience and resolve for our beloved nation, which we call home.  I take note of the statement, that 
<br/>the Government needs to concentrate on the job at hand and stop harassing FijiFirst and our supporters. I 
<br/>must also inform this Parliament about the Special Branch of the Fiji Police that has been following our 
<br/>supporters especially our youth members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Who have been visiting other counterparts in and around Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- I wonder why! Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- The Minister of Home Affairs should stop using the Fiji Police 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to advance his political ambition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh, oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- His Excellency again reiterated and stated: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“No more than ever, we must be united as one nation and strengthen our resolve to 
<br/>work together to meet our collective challenges. We must continue to look after each other 
<br/>especially those less fortunate and the most vulnerable in our society”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PAP Coalition Government must practice good governance.  Do not say “thank you” - you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wait. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And make good the promises it made to the people of Fiji during campaigns in the last General Election.  
<br/>His Excellency stated that he was grateful to note that the change in Government took place peacefully 
<br/>and swiftly and the new administration has commenced its work with the mandate of the people.  He also 
<br/>acknowledged the contribution and achievement of previous Governments in steering this nation in the 
<br/>last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji are well aware of that performance. The contribution and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>achievements - that is the reason why FijiFirst received the highest vote by a single political party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- …and our leader received the highest vote … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Too much vote buying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- ..by any candidate during the General Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>117 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  In  fact,  almost  double  of  that  of  the  Prime  Minister.    His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency then went on to announce the policies and intentions of the PAP Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Too much vote buying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Honourable  Minister,  I  just  want  to  remind  you  that  in  the 
<br/>normal Westminster system you have to give your first maiden speech before you can shout across the 
<br/>floor, that is the normal tradition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government should not use His Excellency to be a messenger of excuses.  As a Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the PAP Coalition should take the bull by its horn and manage it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Oh, yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- No amount of excuses will resolve the work that you need to 
<br/>do.  Honourable Attorney-General  and honourable Minister for Home Affairs must be reminded to stop 
<br/>running  around  like  headless  chicken  and  using  the  Fiji  Police  Force  and  RFMF  for  their  political 
<br/>purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President had touched on social cohesion and unity, and emphasised that the 
<br/>Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion.  There must be a clear focus on upholding 
<br/>the Constitution and the rule of law, the democratic processes including transparency and accountability.  
<br/>You are not doing it.  The actions carried out by the PAP Coalition Government over the last few weeks 
<br/>is  far-far  from  democratic  processes,  transparency  and  accountability.    The  Coalition  Government  is 
<br/>basically giving jobs to their supporters and failed candidates who did not make it to Parliament. You 
<br/>know, do not ask me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PAP Coalition Government supporters continue to harass our Members of Parliament and 
<br/>supporters.  It is being discussed in every gathering and meetings that we attend.  What the Coalition 
<br/>Government has done over the last four weeks, had greatly affected and totally destroyed the very core 
<br/>of the separation of powers.  Why did the Government terminate the contracts of senior civil servants, 
<br/>like  Permanent  Secretaries,  Boards,  CEOs  of  Government  companies  and  entities,  and  put  in  their 
<br/>supporters, party officials and candidates, who failed to secure…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- So you are admitting it?  They did SO without any due processes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and procedures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, economic and investment confidence is at its 
<br/>lowest level ever.  If the Government continues to harass and undermine the rule of law, do not follow 
<br/>proper procedures, deny natural justice and give rise to corruption, people and business and investors will 
<br/>simply fly away.  Those who were planning to invest here, will think twice before coming here.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President also touched on the revival of rural and outer island 
<br/>development  programmes  which  will  boost  socio-economic  development  in  our  rural  settings.    The 
<br/>programmes would be directed at income generating projects, improve infrastructure and better services 
<br/>including affordable cyclone resistant housing, power and water supply, sanitation system and sustainable 
<br/>livelihoods.  Before  I  resume my seat, please  allow me to highlight to PAP Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>honourable Ministers and honourable Assistant Ministers that we members of the FijiFirst, have to go 
<br/>through as Members of the Opposition Party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we the Opposition Members of this side, with our supporters, are continuously 
<br/>harassed by </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  I feel for our Indo-Fijian parliamentarians and supporters.  So if we come into this 
<br/>Parliament and vent our frustrations, you should try and understand.  I am not saying that all the Members 
<br/>of the Government are encouraging and condoning this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Go to the police, do not come here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Why not?  This is people’s Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Go to the police. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  This is the people’s Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Coward! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our parliamentarians and supporters have been 
<br/>verbally and physically abused in public places and on the streets.  If our Indo-Fijian brothers and sisters 
<br/>chose to live as Members of Parliament to work for a quiet and peaceful life, who am I to question them.  
<br/>It is their right and freedom.  Many Fijians, irrespective of ethnicity are migrating to look for greener 
<br/>fields in other countries, which is their gain.  Our MPs have been reported to be picked up by police from 
<br/>home at odd hours to be questioned and released with their interviews suspended - until they raised the 
<br/>question again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I know it, honourable Kamikamica, because I was there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our supporters, especially our youth, have gone to the police to report the Attorney-General 
<br/>and the honourable Prime Minister in doing exactly the same thing that our Secretary-General and 
<br/>our Prime Minister have done and they were told by police that they would be called.  Two weeks 
<br/>later no telephone calls. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>119 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week honourable Bulitavu was taken 
<br/>from his home at 5am.  I decided to visit him and provided him with breakfast and lunch.  The police 
<br/>officers were very kind to me as they recognised me.  The discussion I had with them is that the order 
<br/>to arrest was from the top. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Which means it is from the political masters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  We  have  had  our  supporters  reported  being  harassed 
<br/>especially our indo-Fijian by </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> members of the Opposition.  It is very embarrassing to people 
<br/>like me as an </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and a Christian.  The sad fact is that in one hand you hold the Bible and on the 
<br/>other hand you are holding the stone, cursing, throwing defamatory words and intimidating them and 
<br/>their families.    It  all comes back to  a Christian  value that you vocally lobby about,  starting from 
<br/>Jerusalem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  inform  this  Parliament,  the 
<br/>intimidation that I have experienced.  In my case, my property has been vandalised, it is alright - 
<br/>materials things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Why are you complaining? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I did not want to report it as I know that nothing would be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU- Two weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had to take my wife for 
<br/>a medical review in Canberra, Australia, as she has been diagnosed with cancer.  While at the airport, 
<br/>I was followed around by officials and to avoid my wife being harassed, I took her and served her 
<br/>dinner before I approached the officials.

<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- The first question I asked them, am I a flight risk? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- They asked what passport I was using.  I said, I am using 
<br/>my private passport because I am not entitled to a diplomatic passport.  She then called her boss and 
<br/>told the boss that my diplomatic passport was not with me.  Anyway, I came back and I burnt the 
<br/>passport.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me remind the Government of this simple sentence - since the coming into power of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coalition Government, there has been an air of uncertainty… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  …that  lingers  and  the  general  euphoria  of  a  new 
<br/>government,  new  changes,  very  quickly  turned  into  a  concerted  effort  and  dismantling  of 
<br/>constitutionally established institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Like? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  also  very  evident  now  is  the  abuse  of 
<br/>political  power to  exact  political  vengeance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this statement is  especially  for the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, honourable Attorney-General who are Methodist lay preachers, and for 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, a staunch Catholic brought up by the Brothers and Sisters 
<br/>at Natovi Catholic School. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I wish I could stand on this floor of Parliament,  look up to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>heaven and say, “God forgive these people, for they not know what they are doing”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot utter these words as I will be lying to God.  It is better for them to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say it then me saying it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I say it everyday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt in my mind that there are 
<br/>huge challenges ahead and the most urgent ones are the national economy and rule of law.  Promising 
<br/>Fijians the world is easy, the challenge is to deliver those promises.  I thank you for your indulgence 
<br/>and greatly appreciate this opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  call  on  the  honourable  Joseph  Nand  to 
<br/>deliver his speech, I just want to caution us honourable Members that for those who are delivering 
<br/>their  speeches,  especially  their  maiden  speeches,  what  has  been  indicated  by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau  is  quite  true  because  we  have  to  allow  without  any  interruption  or  heckling  for the 
<br/>speeches  to  be  delivered  smoothly  and  as  such,  I  seek  your  indulgence  here  that  we  observe  that, 
<br/>honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers 
<br/></span><span>and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament;  it is a great honour for me to deliver my maiden speech for being elected to yet another term 
<br/>and congratulate our leader, the former Prime Minister, honourable Bainimarama, for leading FijiFirst in 
<br/>securing the greatest number of seats in this Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, at this juncture, I wish to thank the former Speaker, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, who served in this 
<br/>Parliament with utmost sincere dedication and great responsibility. It is rather unfortunate that he lost out 
<br/>but accepted his defeat with grace which demonstrates the supremacy of our parliamentary process under 
<br/>the 2013 Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also sure that every re-elected Member of this Parliament will agree with 
<br/>me and say that are our last term in Parliament was unforgettable.  I wish to thank those Parliamentarians 
<br/>who did not make it for another term and at the same time, congratulate those who have made it for the 
<br/>first time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move on, allow me to thank my wife, Binita  Nand, and my two children 
<br/>- Justin Nand and Chetan Nand, who have been the pillar of strength and a source of inspiration in my 
<br/>political career.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special  thanks  and  appreciation  go  to  our  team  in  Sigatoka  and  throughout  Fiji  for  their 
<br/>tremendous support in our campaign.  My hearty thanks go to my Campaign Manager, Mr. Abhinesh 
<br/>Raj; members of our team - Mr. Sanjeev, Vishal Jeet, Nalini Devi, Manikam Pillay, Pradeep Singh, Bechu 
<br/>Lal, Jocelyn Singh, Praveen Padyachi, Mohammed Ali of Naidiri Seafood Supplies, Mr. and Mrs. Narend 
<br/>Kumar, Mr. Nandan, Nilesh Kumar, Sanjay Kant, Sonny, Dinesh Singh, Saijadul Jaan Ali, Muni Ratnam, 
<br/>Mohammed Shameem Rehaan, Sanjay Krishna and Rahul Sharma of Lomawai Kava Supplies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am indebted to the unwavering support of numerous communities in Sigatoka,

<br/>areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly thank His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his acknowledgement of achievements of the previous government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bainimarama-led Government and FijiFirst achievements are unmatched

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list is endless and we all know that, so I would like to, once again, thank the 
<br/>able leadership of our leader, honourable Bainimarama and the former Attorney-General and Minister 
<br/>for Economy, Mr. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who had the vision to build Fiji into a modern nation so that 
<br/>all Fijians can enjoy peace, progress, equality, tranquillity and above all, a reassured security so that all 
<br/>could live without any form of fear or intimidation regardless of where one lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  first  20-Year  Development  Plan  provides,  and  I  quote:  “The  forward-
<br/>looking vision for ‘Transforming Fiji’ towards an even more progressive, vibrant and inclusive society.  
<br/>It outlines a framework that encompasses strategic policy manoeuvres, new approaches to development 
<br/>and aspirations of all Fijians.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  achievements  have  been  driven  by  the  establishment  of  a  modern  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inclusive Fijian Constitution that states in Chapter 1, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Republic of Fiji is a sovereign democratic State founded on the values of - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(f)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(g)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(h)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>common and equal citizenry and national unity; 
<br/>respect for human rights, freedom and the rule of law; 
<br/>an independent, impartial, competent and accessible system of justice; 
<br/>equality for all and care for the less fortunate based on the values inherent in this section 
<br/>and in the Bill of Rights contained in Chapter 2; 
<br/>human  dignity,  respect  for  the  individual,  personal  integrity  and  responsibility,  civic 
<br/>involvement and mutual support; 
<br/>good governance, including the limitation and separation of powers;  
<br/>transparency and accountability; and 
<br/>a prudent, efficient and sustainable relationship with nature.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it boggles my mind that this Coalition Government as reported in the media, is 
<br/>thinking  of  changing  our  Constitution.    Wherever  you  go,  there  is  a  powerful  sentiment  of  ethno-
<br/>nationalism being engineered and smeared into our mainstream media.  The hidden agenda behind this 
<br/>is the zeal and lust to divide, and no credible desire to unite, contrary to the FijiFirst Government has 
<br/>done - uniting all Fijians under one banner and giving all its citizens the common name, ‘Fijian’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this fourth or fifth generation Indo-Fijian will, in the near future, have to fill a 
<br/>piece of paper to say that they are Indian.  It is a sad day for all the Fijians in this nation, especially those 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>123 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who had toiled hard and broke every brick of racism to ensure that we are all called Fijians.  Remember 
<br/>the Indo-Fijians have no other place they call or can call ‘home’, Fiji is their home, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government side did not fight this election purely on the interests of all 
<br/>Fijians, but to denounce and discredit the good work done by the FijiFirst Government.  They gave false 
<br/>hope to the people and kept on repeating until people believed and it became truth for them, and they got 
<br/>the votes.  Such was the level of manipulation, Sir.  We have yet to see those promises being fulfilled. 
<br/>All we see is welcoming ceremonies and garlands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President, in his concluding remarks, said and I quote: “The 
<br/>change in our Government gives rise to the opportunity to bring our nation together and start afresh”. The 
<br/>manner in which the Coalition Government, over the past months, have conducted their business and 
<br/>undermined  the  rule  of  law,  violating  policies  and  procedures,  uttered  statements  without  due 
<br/>consideration to the existing laws, reform and SOPs that are in place, reminds me of a poem by WB Yeats 
<br/>– The Second Coming and which says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “Turning and turning in the widening gyre; 
<br/> The falcon cannot hear the falconer; 
<br/> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; 
<br/> Mere anarchy is loosened upon the world, 
<br/> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere 
<br/> The ceremony of innocence is drowned; 
<br/> The best lack all conviction, while the worst 
<br/> Are full of passionate intensity.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to sum it up, let me pay my tribute to our former Attorney-General in his words 
<br/>when he spoke during his presentation of the Voluntary National Review on Thursday, 18</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2019 in 
<br/>New York.  He said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“At the very core of everything we do is an unshakeable commitment to leaving our 
<br/>communities, our country, and the world, better than what we inherited.  We are resolutely 
<br/>committed to equality and inclusivity for all of our citizens, creating a golden era of opportunity 
<br/>for young Fijian girls and boys to take advantage of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2013, we forever enshrined these values in our Constitution, shedding a long history 
<br/>where Fiji was mired with inequality, preferentialism and exclusion.  We’ve put a special focus 
<br/>on bringing in those previously marginalised members of society - particularly our women, our 
<br/>young people, and those living with disabilities - ensuring that the Fijian future would be one 
<br/>not of oppression and missed opportunities, but one of empowerment and inclusion.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what a thought and what a vision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The respectable former Attorney-General said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Your vision may not be fully realised or even given enough coverage but deep down 
<br/></span><span>in everyone’s heart, we all know that we have left a legacy that perhaps will be very hard for 
<br/></span><span>anyone to match.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you very much, Sir, for your contribution, and this Parliament will always have a longing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to welcome you back in the near future should you wish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, let me thank all our voters who stood for FijiFirst, locally and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>abroad, and some who are in eternal abode.  We will continue and commit to champion the causes of our 
<br/>former Prime Minister and our leader laid before this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Best wishes to all the Members of Parliament and as I sojourn, Sir, I leave you with a quote by 
<br/>our Leader and the former Prime Minister, honourable Bainimarama, at the USP Open Day on Friday, 
<br/>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2018, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“They can also tell you some of the ugliest parts of our nation’s history.  Those traumatic 
<br/>periods we endured before any of you were born.  You didn’t experience the political upheavals 
<br/>that ripped apart the fabric of our nation in 1987, and the years of backwards divisive leadership 
<br/>that followed.  You didn’t know the many thousands of Fijians who fled the country, those 
<br/>who lost faith that they could ever be accepted or be successful here in Fiji.  You never knew 
<br/>the suffering of that time, and I assure you, so long as we remain united and keep Fiji on the 
<br/>path of progress, you never will.  Because that is not the Fiji of today. Today, we are a united 
<br/>country, all of you - no matter who you are, no matter where you come from – are Fijians.  We 
<br/>all share the same destiny.  We all share the same love for our country or one another, and we 
<br/>all share the same care and concern for the future direction of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But make no mistake, the voices of hatred and division that once did such untold damage 
<br/>to our nation are not gone.  We’ve pushed them to the fringes of society, but they still persist.  
<br/>I’m sure you may have seen that kind of divisive and damaging thinking on social media, with 
<br/>people attacking those of different ethnicities and those of different religious.  Unfortunately, 
<br/>we are even seeing those kinds of attacks being made by political leaders today in this country.  
<br/>It’s completely unacceptable - it’s not something we can ever tolerate as a society. And as 
<br/>young Fijians, as the next generation, it is you who must finally shut the door for good on any 
<br/>and all attempts to divide our society along ethnic, religious or communal lines.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us wish and pray for the spirit of tolerance never to fade away and we shall 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forever remain a united nation, stronger and bigger than ever before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.  God bless all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name 
<br/>of the honourable Prime Minister, that we thank his Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, 
<br/>for his most gracious Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I also join the honourable Members of Parliament in congratulating you on your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appointment and wish you a successful tenure and good health, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also congratulate all honourable Members of Parliament who have been re-elected, albeit, for a 
<br/>different side, and my best wishes to all the new Members of Parliament. It is my honour and privilege 
<br/>to serve the people of Fiji once again during this term of Parliament, in particular, as your Deputy, Sir. I 
<br/>do  regret, however, looking  around the  room, Mr. Speaker, that the number of  Women  Members of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament in this Parliament has dropped to only five from 11 in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the Parliament of Fiji website, Mr. Speaker, women representation in Parliaments 
<br/>globally has more than doubled in the last 25 years, reaching 24.9 percent in 2020, up from 11.3 percent 
<br/>in 1995. However, women’s parliamentary representation in the Pacific region has been historically low. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Quoting the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) publication, “Women in Parliament – 1995-2020 – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>125 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25 years in review”, a number of barriers were highlighted in the report as contributing factors to the low 
<br/>representation of Pacific women in Parliament, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  region’s  dispersed  geography  makes  it  all  the  more  difficult  for  women  to 
<br/>campaign, as they often cannot afford extensive travel and also because they bear most family 
<br/>and care-giving responsibilities.  The Pacific, unfortunately,  also  has one of the highest 
<br/>levels  of  gender-based  violence  against  women,  which  further  hampers  their  full 
<br/>participation in all areas of life.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am confident, however, Mr. Speaker, that Local Government elections will act as a catalyst 
<br/>to increasing women’s participation in political life.  I am confident that we will see more women 
<br/>and young people put their hands up to serve Fiji through their municipalities.  I am confident  of 
<br/>seeing  many  women  especially,  as  town  and  city  councillors  and  mayors.  Participation  in  Local 
<br/>Government has often been seen as a steppingstone into national politics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, please, allow me a few minutes to make some acknowledgements and say some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>‘thank yous’ during this, my first speech as a Government Member of Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  to  my  small  nuclear  family;  my  pretty  amazing  parents  -  Eta  and  Radike 
<br/>Qereqeretabua who are 81years and 85 years old respectively and who, to this day, continue to be 
<br/>my biggest cheerleaders; my husband and my earthly covering – Poasa; daughter Ana-Lisa and her 
<br/>husband, Jonathan Hill; and my brother - Sakiusa and his bride - Emily in Auckland.   I could not 
<br/>have gone on this journey without your support from day one.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to mention and thank Mr. Dinesh Kumar and our friends of Narere Stage 
<br/>1, at Omkar Road, Narere, and in Penang, and the members of every community and village I was 
<br/>blessed to have visited; from Nadroga to Kadavu, from Navava in Savusavu to Nananu and Burerua 
<br/>in  Tailevu,  from  Nadovu  in  Naitasiri  to  Barara  in  Sabeto,  from  the  Mamanucas  to  Ovalau  and 
<br/>everywhere in between, </span><span>vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am, of course, grateful to all NFP supporters in the Central, Eastern, Western and Northern 
<br/>Divisions, and abroad, and pay tribute to all our candidates.  I have nothing but gratitude for the NFP 
<br/>engine room, whose tonnes of knowledge continue to be invaluable.  To the amazing team of men 
<br/>and women who were my polling agents, I am so grateful for your support, camaraderie and keen 
<br/>interest in the process.  We all learnt a lot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  want  to  acknowledge  my  Fiji  Sign  Language  classmates,  and  my  friends  at  Suva 
<br/></span><span>standup  paddlers  and  the  Suva  Harbour  Foundation.    Then  there  are  those  who  kept  me  in  their 
<br/></span><span>prayers  from  within  my  New  Way  International  Fellowship  church  family  -  thank  you  for  your 
<br/>prayerful  support.    I  am  very  grateful  to  you  all  -  Talatala  Josaia  Tokea,  Talatala  Jope  Tamani, 
<br/>Talatala Jo Lauvanua, your wives and the wider church family in the Central, Eastern, Northern and 
<br/>the Western Divisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>None of this, Mr. Speaker, would have been possible without the mercy and grace of my Lord 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Saviour to whom I return all honour, glory and praise, who has sustained me, lifted my head and 
<br/>gave me strength and provision during this journey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if you allow me, I would like to turn my attention to Housing.  Shelter, as we 
<br/>all know, is a fundamental human need so naturally, housing affordability and accessibility is a felt 
<br/>issue.  In the last three months as our nation transitioned to a new Government after the 2022 General 
<br/>Election, the Ministry of Housing continued its mandated role of providing housing assistance to our 
<br/>low and middle income earning families, from first time home owners, housing assistance for fire 
<br/>victims and people living with disabilities, and the upgrading of informal settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that the housing sector continues to face challenges that impact 
<br/>our roles as service providers.  As I took up office this year, I listened, observed and realised that 
<br/>there is much to do. The demand for housing is increasing, however, supply has not been enough to 
<br/>meet it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I have to say that I am inspired and impressed by the commitment and enthusiasm of the 
<br/>men  and  women,  who  work  in  the  respective  housing  sectors;  the  Ministry  of  Housing;  the 
<br/>institutions – the Housing Authority, Public Rental Board, HART and Koroipita, and I wish to convey 
<br/>my sincere appreciation to them.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span> for your continued hard work and dedication.  I 
<br/>also wish pay tribute to the former Minister, honourable Premila Kumar, for her leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  stated  by  His  Excellency  the  President,  the  ultimate  goal  here  is 
<br/>improving the lives of all the people in Fiji, and this Government aims to increase access to affordable 
<br/>and quality housing to our low and middle income families and those living in informal settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  be  carrying  out  thorough  reviews  and  re-aligning  our 
<br/>strategies to address the challenges the housing sector faces. We will work to strengthen collaboration 
<br/>with private and public sectors to improve the standard of housing and its affordability for the people 
<br/>of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the upgrades of informal settlements will continue for 12 settlements - four in the 
<br/>Central division, seven in the Western Division and one in the Northern Division.  Mr. Speaker, three 
<br/>informal settlements that have had upgrades completed, and this Government will make it our priority 
<br/>to ensure that the issuance of the 99-year leases will be done this year for the 451 households who 
<br/>have been living in the hope of land tenure and security for a long time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency told us that the Government would continue its efforts to 
<br/>end violence against women and girls and to that end, Sir, I humbly ask all honourable Members here 
<br/>and everyone watching to, please, wear black tomorrow and every Thursday, if possible, to show 
<br/>your support for and solidarity with survivors of gender-based violence, to remember those who did 
<br/>not survive, and as a peaceful protest against violence in all its forms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thursdays in black is what I am talking, Mr. Speaker.  It was started by the World Council of 
<br/>Churches in the 1980s as a form of protest against rape and violence.  That has now become a practice 
<br/>for  many  women’s  groups  and  human  rights  defenders  to  stand  in  solidarity  against  domestic 
<br/></span><span>violence and rape, a global campaign against violence and abuse in its many forms and in Fiji, of 
<br/></span><span>course, we know that this  has been led by the Fiji Women’s Crisis  Centre and the Fiji  Women’s 
<br/>Rights Movement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no doubt that there is a lot of work to do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are ready.  It is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my hope that both sides of Parliament will work together for the good of our beloved Fiji.

<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests 
<br/>seated  in  the  gallery,  members  of    media  organisations,  all  those  joining  us  through  televised 
<br/>programme from around the world via Parliament </span><span>Facebook</span><span> live, dear Fijians, families, friends and 
<br/>well wishes from Fiji and abroad; my sincere greetings, </span><span>ram ram, namaste, ni sa bula vinaka</span><span> and </span><span>as-
<br/>salaam alaikum</span><span> to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  glorify  FijiFirst  victory  to  the  Almighty  God.    Thank  you, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, for blessing this nation with your sincere strong leadership and 
<br/>your complete commitment to contribute to the entire nation through best leadership qualities that is 
<br/>unmatched by any other leader. This is evident from the past 16 years, as one can see how much the 
<br/>country and its people have benefitted under your leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Party  General-Secretary,  Mr.  Aiyaz  Sayed-Khaiyum,  for  the  vision  of  trust 
<br/>envisaged in me to be a candidate of such a strong political party. On the same note, I congratulate 
<br/>my fellow Members of Parliament, who have been appointed for another term and to all who are 
<br/>appointed for the first term along with me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me personally acknowledge and thank the people and organisations that 
<br/>were behind FijiFirst and my success as a candidate.  I have been blessed by the Almighty and am 
<br/>humbled as I pay tribute and respect to my late great grandmother, who was dubbed by unscrupulous 
<br/>recruiters with my grandfather who was five years old and ended up in Fiji.  Little did she know that 
<br/>100 years later, her great grandson would contribute to this great nation’s wellbeing by being elected 
<br/>as a Member of Parliament.  Her decision and the decision of her fellow </span><span>jahaji</span><span> brothers and sisters 
<br/>brought great labour force to an inland unknown to them to which we call home today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, any united family becomes an asset to the nation.  I take this opportunity to 
<br/>acknowledge the unwavering support of my dear wife - Radha Romika Kumar, who fully supported 
<br/>and respected my decision to join politics in my early forties; my son - Reyansh Soham Kumar, who 
<br/>is too young to understand my new profession, for his love and affection that makes me strong each 
<br/>day to serve my beloved country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I thank God and remember my late parents – Mr. and Mrs. Ram Deo who, despite all 
<br/>odds, brought me up in the dairy farming community of Viria in Naitasiri.  They must be smiling 
<br/>from the heavens fort and unfolding blessings in many ways as I stand here today in this prestigious 
<br/>chamber of the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I would also like thank my nephew - Azhar Tanvir Ali, who has always been 
<br/>there beside me in this journey and Mr. and Mrs. Arfaz Ali for their continued support towards me 
<br/>and my family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank my in-laws – Mr. and Mrs. Hansraj Harakh, who have nurtured my beautiful wife and 
<br/>happily married her to me 18 years ago, despite I hailed from a rural setup with only basic facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My sincere thanks to my two brothers, my sister-in-laws, a sister and brother-in-law, who 
<br/>have  always  stood  by  my  side  and  to  all  my  nephews  and  nieces  for  their  continued  love  and 
<br/>obedience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my teachers who have taught me at Viria 
<br/>Public School, Bhawani Dayal Arya College, Vedic Training Centre, University of the South Pacific, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>University of Fiji, Fiji College of Advanced Education and Australia Pacific Training Coalition.  The 
<br/>efforts of my teachers in shaping my character and personality are shining today as I embrace politics. 
<br/>They have become successful in instilling discipline in me from back in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before deciding to enter politics, I have been a secondary school teacher, a 
<br/>social and religious worker, Justice of Peace (JP), marriage celebrant and a counsellor.  It took me 
<br/>18  years  to  fully  understand  and  train  myself  to  prepare  for  the  bigger  responsibility.  Yes,  Sir,  I 
<br/>believe in achieving excellence through patience and today as I look back, I am proud that I have 
<br/>come up the ladder. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  sincerely  acknowledge  the  tremendous  support  and  faith  of  the  fellow 
<br/>teachers, ex-students, parents and community of following schools that I have been privileged to be 
<br/>a teacher - DAV College in Nabua, Rishikul Sanatan College, Jasper Williams High School, Basden 
<br/>Anglican College, Bhawani Dayal Arya College, Pt. Shreedhar Maharaj College, Vunimono High 
<br/>School and Dilkusha Methodist High School in Nausori.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  following  organisations  who  have  played  a  pivotal  role  in 
<br/>nurturing me into an aspiring politician. They have provided me with various platforms and nurtured 
<br/>me to this honourable title: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji for providing necessary training and providing me with my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>first employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shree Sanatan Dharam Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji and Sanatan Rewa Branch for having faith 
<br/>in me to lead the Youth Council and serve as Branch General Secretary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Methodist Church in Fiji Indian Division - Dilkusha Circuit for instilling strong values in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me through the word of God.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry  of  Education  for  being  my  employer  and  providing  me  with  necessary  skills, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>training and exposure to serve at different positions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Justice for allowing me to serve in different capacities mentioned earlier on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian Broadcasting Corporation Limited and Fiji Television Limited for providing me an 
<br/>opportunity  to  reach  out  to  the  nation  and  the  rest  of  the  world  through  broadcast 
<br/>programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with my vast experience in educational, religious and social organisations, 
<br/>I urge this august Parliament to leave behind old politics on race and religious lines and join hands 
<br/>to embrace the changes needed to develop our nation into an era of development which is inclusive 
<br/>and which benefits every member of our nation.   Sir, that is the challenge that the FijiFirst manifesto 
<br/>is providing for all Members of Parliament present in this Chamber to embrace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Joining politics is not an overnight decision.  It requires deep thought, perseverance, sacrifice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and commitment.  My interest in joining politics grew in 2018 but as alluded earlier, it is all God’s 
<br/></span><span>will and His plans. I have always admired the leaders of this nation and got encouraged by many of 
<br/>you seated here.  To serve the nation, one must serve God and his people first.  It is the people who 
<br/>put us here and I will totally fail in my duty if I do not acknowledge the support of my people from 
<br/>all over Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge  the  ‘vanua’  and  chief  of  Viria  Village,  Naqali  Village,  Savu  Village, 
<br/>Nawaqabena Village, Vatulili Village, Korovou Village, Waisasavu Village, Waisa Village, Nasama

<br/>Naiborebore and Waitolu Village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also acknowledge the support and vote towards my success from the following settlements, 
<br/>my immediate family living along me at Naduri Settlement, Wainikia and Viria Settlement for their 
<br/>tremendous support, people and families of Lomaivuna, Vunidawa, Muaniweni, Nasi, Sawani, Tauli 
<br/>and Nakadi, Waila, Navuso, Dilkusha, Vuci, Waituri, Vuci South, Vusuya, Raralevu, Korociriciri,

<br/>Madhuvani, Barotu and Vunikavikaloa in Rakiraki, Labasa, Savusavu, Levuka and Taveuni. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  people  of  Fiji  for  their  belief  in  me  and  my  party.    I  thank  all  my  campaign 
<br/>managers and all those who accompanied me to nationwide campaign.  Finally, I would like to thank 
<br/>the Supervisor of Elections, Mr. Mohammed Saneem for his excellent execution of the 2022 General 
<br/>Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  being  a  Member  of  Parliament,  I  shall  not  only  serve  my  province  of 
<br/>Naitasiri but I am duty bound to serve the entire nation.  I request members of the public to approach 
<br/>me freely for any matters that I can be of use to anyone, irrespective of their political affiliations.  I 
<br/>know your languages and want to understand you better to try and solve the problem that you are 
<br/>faced with.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, many of the FijiFirst supporters did not vote during this election out of 
<br/>fear of victimisation, but I urge the voters to exercise their rights freely and vote with confidence, for 
<br/>their vote decides the future of this beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  thrilled  to  take  note  of  the  initiative  of  the  FijiFirst  Government 
<br/>towards  strengthening  National  Marketing  Authority  and  future  export  market  for  root  crops, 
<br/>vegetables and fruits growing locally in the world market with better pricing so that farmers who are 
<br/>involved in farming enjoy measurable return.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same note, the FijiFirst Government’s assistance towards the dairy industry is very 
<br/>much appreciated.  This includes transportation, subsidies, dairy and cow feed subsidies, well-trained 
<br/>agricultural staff, livestock loss replacement programmes and negotiations for fair farm gate pricing 
<br/>to milk suppliers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  will  directly  benefit  the  farmers  in  rural  areas,  who  will  assist  in 
<br/>developing our agro-industry further.  While thanking the past and future milestone successes of the 
<br/>Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the current Government to pay greater attention to dairy and 
<br/>vegetable farmers of this nation, for they work hard to put fresh produce on our tables. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President of Fiji, in his most gracious speech spoke so 
<br/>much about the indigenous rights that he failed to acknowledge that the Indo-Fijians also exist in the 
<br/>nation and whose contribution go as far as 143 years back.  He failed to acknowledge that we are all 
<br/></span><span>Fijians.  My plea to the Government is to consider everyone as equal citizens and protect the common 
<br/></span><span>citizenry and identity as enshrined in the 2013 Constitution.  For anywhere in the world I will go, I 
<br/>will be addressed as a Fijian national and not an Indian national.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While giving a common national identity does not mean that I will share the indigenous rights 
<br/>or royalties but in return, it will give me a sense of belonging since Fiji is home to the children of 
<br/></span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> and this is where we belong.  Then only the Girmit Day (public holiday) will sound more 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appropriate and meaningful.  Girmit should not remind us that we the descendants do not belong here 
<br/>but should be acknowledged as the immense contribution of our foreparents in building this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Girmit  Day  will  sound  more  meaningful  if  the  Government  of  the  day 
<br/>continues to protect the rights of the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> children through promoting the languages, culture 
<br/>and heritage of  Indian diasporas.   The  contribution  of the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> and their children in  nation 
<br/>building is immense and it pains to hear from His Excellency that my people are classed as minorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, to the people of Fiji, I thank you. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will 
<br/>work every day for you, I will walk a mile in your shoes, I will be courageous, I will be worthy of 
<br/>the trust you have placed in me and I will not let you down.  I believe that our greatest strength lies 
<br/>in our diversity.  We must celebrate and embrace the differences that make our nation great and work 
<br/>to promote unity and understanding.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  acknowledge  His  Excellency’s  Address  at  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opening of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on your appointment to the high office, and your 
<br/>Deputy  –  honourable  Lenora  Qereqeretabua.    I  wish  you  all  the  best  in  keeping  the  honourable 
<br/>Members of this Parliament in check. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also congratulate the honourable Prime Minister and his Coalition partners 
<br/>for forming the Government by only one vote, however, a win is a win.  But I also want to remind 
<br/>Parliament to, please, stop saying, “that the people appointed this Government”.  We all know that it 
<br/>is SODELPA that appointed this Government, not the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is to be noted that all 29 Government Members in Parliament are either 
<br/>Ministers or Assistant Ministers, and if you think that, that is unusual, then look at the appointment 
<br/>of three Deputy Prime Ministers, in a country with less than a million people. So, congratulations for 
<br/>setting a world record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the Election, there was much hype on reducing the cost of Ministerial 
<br/>salaries. In reality, the cost has increased after 10 percent reduction in salary. Are they noy fooling 
<br/>the public?  Is this how the Coalition Government will fulfil its Election promises?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our leader, honourable Bainimarama, and the former Attorney-General, Mr. 
<br/>Sayed-Khaiyum,  were  accused of holding too  many portfolios.  People are now questioning  why 
<br/>honourable Rabuka is holding so many portfolios, despite having three Deputy Prime Ministers and 
<br/>each Member of Parliament in the Coalition Government are holding a ministerial post. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They blamed FijiFirst for this but how different are you?  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Coalition Government has gone back in time with ministerial portfolios that are no longer 
<br/>applicable in the 21st Century but they will do it come what may, because it is all about themselves 
<br/>individually not about the country, even if their actions will cause social disruption. For example, in 
<br/>their quest to get PWD come what may, they have already caused hundreds of job losses for those 
<br/>working for Fijian and foreign companies.  Is this the change people wanted - to be jobless?

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>131 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  applaud  all  women  who  made  it  to  Parliament.  However,  women 
<br/>representation in Parliament has taken a nosedive, as we have heard from honourable Qereqetabua, 
<br/>14 percent in 2014, 22 percent in 2018 and 9 percent in 2022.  It is not that women do not stand for 
<br/>election.   In 2022 55 women fought the election and only six succeeded and we now only have five,  
<br/>after one resignation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in total, all 55 women candidates received a meagre 37,159 votes, which is 
<br/>16 percent of the total votes cast.  This is a very poor result for a country where women make up 50 
<br/>percent of the population.  A considerable amount of work on the ground needs to be undertaken to 
<br/>ensure more women are in Parliament and participating at the highest level of decision making.  In 
<br/>this regard, it is important that women support women and not just give lip service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recall the Maiden Speech made by the honourable Prime Minister in 2018, 
<br/>where he said, that during his time as Prime Minister, only two women were Members of Parliament: 
<br/>one of them became his Deputy Prime Minister; and the second was a Cabinet Minister.  Today, we 
<br/>have four women in his Government with only one given a Cabinet Minister post.  She, as Deputy 
<br/>Leader of PAP, could have been a Deputy Prime Minister to give some sort of gender balance.  I 
<br/>hope women are watching this and I appeal to all women to see for themselves, that it is really a job 
<br/>for the boys. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate my colleagues on this side of Parliament, as we represent the 
<br/>single largest  Party in  Parliament.  I sincerely  express  my  appreciation and profound gratitude to 
<br/>every  Fijian  for  their  unwavering  support  for  FijiFirst.    It  is  a  great  privilege  once  again  to  be  a 
<br/>Member of Parliament, and I owe this privilege to our leader and the people of Fiji who chose me to 
<br/>represent them in this august Parliament for the second time.  As an effective Opposition we are here 
<br/>to support policies that are good for the nation, and probe for clarity, transparency and accountability 
<br/>in the governance of this nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tourism and airline sectors which were worst hit during the COVID -19 
<br/>pandemic, has seen the fastest growth under the FijiFirst Government and we heard from honourable 
<br/>Bainivalu and honourable  Gavoka on how well our airline and the tourism sector is performing.   Not 
<br/>once did they give credit to the FijiFirst Government for its rock-solid policies and strong leadership 
<br/>during COVID-19 that saved our airline from going belly-up at a time when other airlines folded up 
<br/>for good.  Honourable Gavoka is on record for expressing his concern that Qantas was not playing 
<br/>an active role in the affairs of Fiji Airways, knowing very well that Qantas is in competition with our 
<br/>national carrier.  Now my question to honourable Gavoka is, we want to know when will honourable 
<br/>Gavoka bring Qantas, to save Fiji Airways and to increase Fiji Airways profitability?  And I ask him 
<br/>to read Hansard 25</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  Members  of  Parliament,  then  in  Opposition,  had  objected  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everything that the Government was doing.  They even demanded the return of the aircrafts… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- </span><span>Tik Tok</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- … and even circulated </span><span>Tik Tok</span><span> eating aeroplanes… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They suggested printing of money, and reduction of civil servants pay.  Thank God, we did 
<br/>not listen to them, not to a single one of them.   Imagine if we did return the planes or printed more 
<br/>money, the scenario would be very different today.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians are watching and they are curious to know how this Government 
<br/>will manage the economy and when will they reduce the cost of living, which was the key agenda 
<br/>during their campaign.  Coalition Parties had a lot of pre-election promises.  People are now asking 
<br/>as to – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when  the  honourable  Prasad  will  remove  the  20  percent  fuel  subsidy  to  make  fuel 
<br/>affordable; 
<br/>when  will  the  Government  restore  individual  FNPF  member  funds  withdrawn  during 
<br/>COVID-19 for self-help; 
<br/>when will they increase the minimum wage to $5 an hour; 
<br/>when will they increase the social welfare payment from $100 to $200 which is on record, 
<br/>as said by honourable Tabuya; and 
<br/>now  that  we  have  the  honourable  Agni  Deo  Singh  in  the  Government,  how  will  this 
<br/>Government fulfil the call he made for a 20 percent across the board salary increase for 
<br/>teachers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji were waiting for the mini budget to hear the good news, but then the Minister of 
<br/>Finance is not in agreement with his Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. NAND.- Give it to honourable Radrodro. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, leadership is about making a difference in people’s 
<br/>lives and we heard that from the honourable Prime Minister.  Our leader demonstrated not only during 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic but throughout his journey as the Prime Minister of Fiji.  His Excellency has 
<br/>also mentioned in his speech that the last three years have been full of challenges and acknowledged 
<br/>that we have risen to the challenges and demonstrated our resilience as a nation and as one people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I pay tribute to our leader, honourable Bainimarama, for everything Fiji has accomplished 
<br/>under his leadership.  We owe him a great deal of gratitude for the social, economic, and political 
<br/>stability that we enjoyed and often took it for granted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FijiFirst  Government’s  contribution  and  achievements  was  also 
<br/>acknowledged by His Excellency in his Address. The achievements of the FijiFirst Government are 
<br/>well known but there are many who conveniently turn a blind eye. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Free Education, School Grants, Free Bus Fares, Dignity Packs for our girls 
<br/>and Toppers and TELS were the greatest achievements of the FijiFirst Government, not forgetting 
<br/>the infrastructure development. Now TELS and Toppers are in jeopardy. How will Scholarships be 
<br/>given?  Is  it  to  everyone  who  qualifies  for  tertiary  education  or  just  to  those  based  on  merit  or 
<br/>ethnicity?  What happens to others?  Are they left on their own to fend for themselves and deplete 
<br/>their parents’ FNPF or get loans at high interest rate from the financial institutions or abandon tertiary 
<br/>education completely?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, the government has continued TELS for first semester of 2023, 
<br/>but it is not clear what will happen from the second semester?  I have been advised that some students 
<br/>have not enrolled because of lack of information on what will happen to TELS and if TELS goes out 
<br/>of the window, how will it be replaced by scholarships and then who will qualify? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the enormity of promising a piece of moon just to win an election is now 
<br/>starring in  the eyes of government  because they  went  ahead  and made election promises without 
<br/></span><span>realising that its easier said than done.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree that we had to borrow during our 
<br/></span><span>time, but these borrowings were for capital works, and these were very well managed. FijiFirst time,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government had never defaulted a single repayment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And none of us sitting in this Parliament have built our empire without 
<br/>borrowing.  Government debt should not become an excuse for the Coalition Government to borrow 
<br/>further, borrowing depends on how good your economic and social policies are.  How robust your 
<br/>financial  and  economic  governance  are.    Something  that  lenders  and  development  partners  had 
<br/>confidence in FijiFirst Government which enabled us to borrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency stated that ‘there must be a clear focus on the rule of law 
<br/>and  democratic  processes  including  transparency,  accountability,  respect  for  human  rights  and 
<br/>freedoms,  and  listening  to  the  views  of  the  people  through  genuine  consultation.    Is  this  being 
<br/>practised?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  already  witnessed  the  high-handed  nature  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government since they came into power. Let me remind them, it happened in 1987, yes it happened 
<br/>in 1986.  This is 2023, 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century, please, stop doing that now.  You are the elected government - 
<br/>we recognise that… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- And you have lost it, we had it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What happened in 2006? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen and experienced the revengeful mood 
<br/>of the Coalition partners.  We see that there is virtually a takeover of institutions that are independent.  
<br/>We see people being fired or forced to resign. We see failed politicians and cronies being put in high 
<br/>positions in the civil service and on the Boards.  I can give you an example of Mr. Leawere, who was 
<br/>a SODELPA failed politician who is now firing the shots at the Ministry of Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- He is qualified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They have been quick to appoint those who lost the election or are 
<br/>Party  supporters  and  some  of  them  were  appointed  before  the  application  for  board  membership 
<br/>closed, and a good example is the FBC Board.  We have seen how incompetent the chair is.  They 
<br/>have  blamed  FijiFirst  for  this.  You  have  blamed  FijiFirst  for  this  but  my  question  to  you  is  how 
<br/>different are you?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very different. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, we have seen the difference in just a few weeks. And is this the 
<br/>change  they  advocated?    Please  wake  up.  You  have  won  the  election  -run  the  Government 
<br/>appropriately.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many people pleasing initiatives or self-pleasing actions that have 
<br/></span><span>been put in place by the Coalition Government, without understanding the economic consequences 
<br/></span><span>or public sentiments. His Excellency has asked the Government to put in place necessary measures 
<br/>so that there is a level playing field certainty and consistency of policies that will boost confidence 
<br/>across the board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, where is this level playing field certainty and consistency of politics? For 
<br/>example, in  the Ministry of Education, let me share a  recent  </span><span>Facebook</span><span>  message. The failed PAP 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>candidate  is  still  claiming  to  be  the  General  Secretary  of  Fijian  Teachers  Association,  Mr.  Paula 
<br/>Manumanunitoga, on his </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page addressed teachers Fiji wide.  What caught my attention  
<br/>was this paragraph, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I wish to mention that now as I sit as FTA Rep in the MOE Staff Board, I shall be 
<br/>promoting only the interests of those faithful FTA members who stuck with us and showed 
<br/>true unionism qualities in solidarity and standing for our rights.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He ends his statement by guaranteeing job security and promotion assistance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this 
<br/>is worrying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- That is the change! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Why should unions be involved in the appointment and promotion of 
<br/>teachers? Are unions involved in the private sector?  I would like to ask honourable Kamikamica, 
<br/>statutory bodies and other Government entities when it comes to appointments and promotion? They 
<br/>are not. They are not involved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You wanted to destroy the unions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  I  had  raised  this  practice  of  the  past  before  which  was  denied  by 
<br/>honourable Agni Deo Singh when he was the General Secretary of FTU. Now it is out in the open. 
<br/>Now it is all about who you know and not what you know.  Mr. Speaker merit-based appointments 
<br/>created  level  playing  field  giving  equal  opportunities  to  all  Fijians,  regardless  of  province,  race, 
<br/>religion, cast or creed.  Unfortunately, we are going backwards. I appeal to the teachers to wake up 
<br/>and see what is happening. There is no level playing field at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  deeply  concerned  that  His  Excellency  had  nothing  to  say  about  the 
<br/>development of informal settlements and housing needs. I read his speech again and again thinking he 
<br/>must have mentioned it somewhere.  We heard from honourable Tabuya and honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/>consistently in the Parliament that the FijiFirst Government had no plans to address the housing needs 
<br/>and I hope that honourable Qereqeretabua, now that she is the Assistant Minister for Housing, you may 
<br/>have seen what all we have done and thank you for acknowledging that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- But where is the Coalition Governments Plan on such an important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue? Is this issue so insignificant that it could not make it to the President’s Speech?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to comment on the declaration of extra public holidays for Girmit 
<br/>Day and Ratu Sukuna Day.  It is up to the Government of the day to determine the number of holidays. 
<br/>By not having these two holidays, it did not mean that FijiFirst Government did not recognise the 
<br/>significance behind this. FijiFirst Government recognised that both are an important part of history. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, my issue and people have also pointed out that while 14th May marks the day when 
<br/></span><span>our forefathers first landed in Fiji, unfortunately this day also marks one of the darkest day in Fijian 
<br/></span><span>history  the  coup  of  1987  carried  out  by  none  other  than  the  current  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Sitiveni Rabuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- What are you talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We are talking about Girmit.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst Girmit holidays are welcomed, 14</span><span>th</span><span> May will not be appropriate as 
<br/>this  day  will  not  be  solely  dedicated  to  </span><span>Girmityas</span><span>  but  they  will  see  14</span><span>th</span><span>  May  as  the  day  many 
<br/>descendants were raped, tortured, made homeless and relegated to second class citizen.  Any other 
<br/>date before that could be a good option. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2018 when I entered the Parliament for the first time, I acknowledged the 
<br/>people who have made an impact in my life, also those who had motivated and inspired me to enter 
<br/>politics.  Today, I acknowledge them once again for putting their trust in me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my parents - the late Mr. Ram Karan and late Mrs. Ram Kuar, I am sure you are here with 
<br/>me in spirit.  Thank you for moulding me into what I am today.  To my husband Jayendra for your 
<br/>unwavering love and support that helped me to pursue my dream whether as a professional or in 
<br/>politics.  To my children; Shaman, Yamal and Ashmi for being my rock, to my 2023 campaign team 
<br/>members  for  their  commitment,  advice  and  hard  work  in  organising  campaign  meetings.    To  my 
<br/>standard Bureta Street family for your staunch support, to my brother Sunil Karan, his wife Sangeeta, 
<br/>and his friends.  Thank you for always being there whenever I needed you.  To my in-laws from the 
<br/>Western, Central and Northern Division; thank you very much, </span><span>bahut dhanyavad.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very special acknowledgement to Ms. Gayatri for her unwavering support throughout my 
<br/>campaign trail - thank you for everything and I do cherish your friendship.  Last but not the least, a 
<br/>big  thank  you  to  my  supporters  from  Nausori  to  Navua,  Western  and  Eastern  Division,  Labasa, 
<br/>Savusavu, Levuka, Taveuni for their votes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to His Excellency’s most gracious 
<br/>speech  delivered  in  this  august  Parliament  to  mark  the  opening  of  the  new  Parliament  under  the 
<br/>People’s Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I wish to acknowledge the presence of the Holy Spirit in this august 
<br/>Parliament in guiding me through my campaign trail. I also congratulate your appointment as Speaker 
<br/>of this august Parliament and congratulate honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua for her appointment as 
<br/>Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his confidence and trust 
<br/>placed on me to be part of his candidate listing and to be on the line-up of Ministerial portfolios.  I 
<br/>am deeply honoured, honourable Prime Minister, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank all my supporters nationwide, who have voted me here and I wish to ensure 
<br/>you all that I will be your voice in this august Parliament.  </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu na nomuni veitokoni, 
<br/>vinaka saka vakalevu na nomuni digidigi kei na nomuni veivakabauti </span><span>(Thank you all so much for 
<br/>your support, thank you for your votes and for your trust)</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not the least, I would like to acknowledge and extend my sincerest appreciation to 
<br/>my immediate family.  I thank my wife - Elenoa Ravu, and my children for their never-ending support 
<br/></span><span>during my campaign trail.  I also thank all my extended families nationwide for their confidence and 
<br/></span><span>trust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I share the sentiments of His Excellency the President that the outbreak of COVID-19 has 
<br/>disturbed the global political, social, economic, religious and financial structures.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>as the nation regroups to take a grip of this crisis, the People’s Coalition Government is determined 
<br/>to elevate Fiji to greater heights with proactive planning and smart partnerships.  The Government is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is of the people, by the people and for the people.  We, therefore, must be united as one nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  national  debt  has  widened  and  putting  all  eggs  in  one  basket  is  not  the 
<br/>solution.  The potential of natural resource-based sectors like fisheries, forestry and others cannot be 
<br/>further undermined.  The Ministry is working hard to shift its strategy to ensure a balance between 
<br/>protection  and  production,  equitable  benefits  and  community  empowerment  through  relevant 
<br/>capacity building and training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scope of such resources is wholesome and integrated - from the ridges 
<br/>of our mountains to the trenches of our oceans.  I hold a portfolio that is most dear to the people of 
<br/>Fiji.  The Coalition Government’s ambition is to build on the efforts of those who have served before 
<br/>me, so that I may play my part in creating something even greater for those who have yet to arrive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, fisheries and forestry are two natural resource-based and economic service 
<br/>sectors that can assist Fiji on its road to national economic recovery.  The Ministry was one of the 
<br/>few that developed an economy recovery plan to help cushion the impacts of the crisis.  In addition 
<br/>to the economic contribution, the Ministry also strives to make a social and environment impact as 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry recognises the need to strengthen its laws and policies.  This will support the 
<br/>vision of the Coalition Government in providing a capable environment that will allow the sector to 
<br/>advance to greater heights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  ‘30  Million  Trees  in  15  Years’  initiative  was  very 
<br/>encouraging  as  we  were  able  to  engage  with  communities  -  women,  youth,  et  cetera,  to  set  up 
<br/>nurseries and sell seedlings that were used for planting efforts across Fiji.  Now with your Coalition 
<br/>Government we will not only plant but ensure the survival rate is successful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During my maiden tour to the Central, Eastern and Northern Divisions, I had the opportunity 
<br/>to  present  cheque  payments  for  seedlings  in  Tailevu,  Ovalau,  Taveuni  and  Vanua  Levu.    Your 
<br/>Government, thanks all Fijians for their commitment to this national initiative, and encourages them 
<br/>to continue to plant trees as your efforts not only helps in the fight against climate change but also 
<br/>contributes to Fiji’s climate commitments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, forestry research seeks to  develop  new technologies that  can be used to 
<br/>assist  in  economic  development  programmes  designed  to  improve  human  well-being,  while 
<br/>protecting the natural resource base and the environment.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will inject more resources and efforts towards the research of non-wood 
<br/>forest products namely, sandalwood, bamboo, </span><span>sikeci</span><span> and </span><span>dilo. </span><span> This will ease the pressure on native 
<br/>forests,  provide  opportunities  for  diversification  and  will  benefit  communities  directly  through 
<br/>engagement,  training,  seedling  sales  and  products  from  mature  trees.      As  a  result  of  the  above, 
<br/>reliance on timber and chips for economic growth will be reduced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  same  note  of  industry  assistance  and  development,  we  have  our 
<br/></span><span>forestry sector boasting the largest mature mahogany planation in the world.  The Ministry is keen to 
<br/></span><span>work with the mahogany industry to facilitate the needs and boost the sector to greater economic 
<br/>contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the ways to achieve this is through forest certification. The Ministry, 
<br/>in consultation with Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL), will complete work on this process 
<br/>under the Forest Stewardship Council. This preparation of FHCL to target entry into the Certification  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme is vital for the premium market positioning of Fiji’s mahogany products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  forestry  sector  aims  to  reposition  its  current  objectives  in  the  pine 
<br/>industry.  The  Ministry  will  strengthen  partnerships  with  all  stakeholders  and  primarily  the 
<br/>landowning units at the heart of every decision-making process. Pine forests currently leased already 
<br/>have a certification in place as a requirement from their timber and chip markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the health of Fiji fisheries is  a matter of national importance because  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fish provides an important food source for Fiji’s population; 
<br/>it mitigates the effects of natural disasters, including the effects of climate change; and 
<br/>the  inter-connectivity  of  fishing,  aquaculture  and  tourism  is  an  economic  driver  that 
<br/>generates revenue for Fiji’s economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That being said, and as clearly articulated in His Excellency’s Address, the diversification of 
<br/>our resource-based sectors to strengthen the growth of our economy and increase the “size of our 
<br/>pie” that will furthermore increase our potential to trade, is a change that this Government will give 
<br/>rise to, as we start afresh.  For that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot and must not remain complacent in 
<br/>the face of more challenges ahead of us, we must continue to seize every opportunity we have to 
<br/>grow our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point, I would like to speak briefly on areas that the Ministry of Fisheries will focus 
<br/>on and strengthen, to grow our resource-based sectors.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the context of regional 
<br/>fisheries, our tuna resources are key drivers of our small island economies and have always provided 
<br/>a solid revenue and economic base for Pacific Island Countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  development  and  implementation  of  international  and  regional  fisheries  management 
<br/>framework have ensured that we, as Pacific Island Countries, manage and use our tuna resources 
<br/>sustainably  and  also  ensure  that  our  fish  stocks  remain  healthy  and  viable.    Your  Coalition 
<br/>Government values its development partners and stakeholders in driving targeted investments within 
<br/>the domestic fishing industry.   This includes upgrading the fishing vessels to fish in high seas, invest 
<br/>in satellite technology to monitor our EEZ and reposition our investment and loan policy capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the value of coastal fisheries to our nation is understated.  Production from 
<br/>fisheries offers extensive benefits to our communities, including employment and nutrition, as well 
<br/>as social and recreational value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  well-being  of  all  Fijians  is  the  ultimate  priority  of  the  Coalition  Government.  The 
<br/>Ministry is working to provide alternatives for an ever-increasing population.  It will review current 
<br/>capital projects and engagement with other Government agencies to empower communities to benefit 
<br/>economically and socially.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to collaborate with development partners to strengthen investment 
<br/>in the culture of high valued commodities to boost the fisheries sector.  The Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>will focus its current objectives of developing seaweed, edible oysters, pearl oysters, Mabe pearls 
<br/></span><span>and  giant  clams  to  ensure  these  commodities  reach  their  optimum  levels  of  production  to  meet 
<br/></span><span>consumers’ demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry,  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector  will  work  on  mass 
<br/>production  of  selected  species  in  communities  and  work  to  identify  high-end  markets  for  these 
<br/>commodities.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As stated in His Excellency the President’s most gracious Address, the new efforts that will 
<br/>be directed to revitalising the co-operative movement is welcomed.  This is aligned to the Ministry’s 
<br/>work in establishing Fishermen Co-operatives to foster greater participation by resource owners and 
<br/>to  empower  them  in  elevating  and  expanding  their  fishing  business.    Your  People’s  Coalition 
<br/>Government  will be steadfast in its efforts to ensure Fijians are food secure and have their needs 
<br/>provided for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  review  the  scope  of  assistance  to  food  security  and 
<br/>commercial aquaculture development programmes to focus on large scale communal co-operative 
<br/>assistance.  We will aggressively work with farmers to assess their production as this will be a critical 
<br/>time for aquaculture in Fiji.  As a result, this strategy will produce and supply the maximum number 
<br/>of tilapia fries and shrimp post-larvae to encourage large scale intensive farming, as well as support 
<br/>small-scale aquaculture farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The intensifying impact of climate change on our oceans, for instance, is compelling us to 
<br/>review our approaches of managing our oceans and fisheries resources.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, manpower 
<br/>and  financial  support  have  always  played  an  important  role  in  sustainable  fisheries  and  forestry 
<br/>management.  If we are to ensure progress, we must invest in our workforce and identify appropriate 
<br/>funding to support their work.  Your Coalition Government, through internal and external partners, 
<br/>will address these needs immediately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all share the benefits of our fisheries and forestry resources.  We are honoured to have 
<br/>inherited these blessings from our forefathers who have protected these resources for us.  It is our 
<br/>time now to do the same.  We must change the narrative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  my  prayer  that  we  will  exercise  wisdom  in  every  front  of  our 
<br/>deliberation in this august Parliament, to guarantee progress of the present and future generations.  I 
<br/>would like to end with a line from the poem, </span><span>Invictus</span><span>, and I quote: “I am the master of my fate, I am 
<br/>the captain of my soul.”  We all have a part to play in steering this ship of change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless you, may God bless Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will resume when the bell sounds.  The Parliament is adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  I have to say that it is nice to see 
<br/>the smiles.  I hope you had a good lunch time.  We will resume the Replies to His Excellency’s most 
<br/>gracious Address and   I now call on the Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation to 
<br/>have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>, 
<br/></span><span>namaste</span><span> and </span><span>faiaksia </span><span>to everyone watching at home and around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  congratulate  you  on  your  election  as  Deputy  Speaker  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  I also congratulate Mr. Speaker for his election in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to, first of all, thank my Lord and Saviour for granting us the victory we fought 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so hard for to free our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What a wonderful journey this has been. We have overcome.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, today 15</span><span>th</span><span> February, marks the Child Cancer Day. The gold ribbon 
<br/>I wear and some of my colleagues are wearing, signifies this important fight.  I acknowledge with 
<br/>much gratitude WOWS Kids Fiji which is Walk on Walk Strong, the only group that dedicates its 
<br/>work to supporting children living with cancer in Fiji.  To all our children and families living with 
<br/>this dreadful disease, I say to you - Walk on Walk Strong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today,  I stand before you, Madam  Deputy  Speaker, humbled and grateful,  as your newly 
<br/>elected Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation.  I am honoured by the trust and faith 
<br/>that  is  being  placed  in  me  to  serve  our  people,  and  I  promise  to  do  my  best  to  live  up  to  your 
<br/>expectations.  I acknowledge both my predecessors - Ms. Rosy Akbar and Ms. Mereseini Rakuita, 
<br/>for their hard work and leadership in the Ministry, and who both saw the light and resigned from 
<br/>FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to reply to His Excellency the President’s Opening Address 
<br/>and thank him for clearly outlining our vision.  The honourable Leader of the Opposition is right 
<br/>when he said, and I quote: “This is not the Fiji of 55 days ago, this is not a Parliament of 55 days 
<br/>ago.”    Indeed,  it  is  not  -  this  is  a  Fiji  that  is  finally  free  from  15  years  of  fear,  intimidation, 
<br/>victimisation and unjust control.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Go and talk to the people on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It absolutely baffles me, Madam Deputy  Speaker, that my colleagues 
<br/></span><span>on  the  other  side  have  absolutely  zero  self-reflection  skills  with  all  the  baseless  accusations.  
<br/></span><span>Honourable Premila Kumar stated the rape of  Indo-Fijian women  and children in  1987.  Give us 
<br/>facts, where are the police complaints?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- You talk nonsense.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Your  entire  campaign  (FijiFirst)  ran  on  sowing  seeds  of  fear  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hatred against our leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Koroilavesau,  you  stated  that  Indo-Fijians  were  being  victimised  by  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where is the proof?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Give us the facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Come here and I will give you the facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The air condition, Madam Deputy Speaker, in this room is not enough 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to deal with the amount of hot air coming from the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  I  want  to  say to  them,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker; “</span><span>Sa rauta mada</span><span>! 
<br/>Listen </span><span>mada</span><span>! Learn </span><span>mada</span><span>!”  It does not matter how much you boast about your leader having the 
<br/>highest  votes,  or  that  you  have  the  most  number  of  seats,  you  are  in  the  Opposition.    Accept  it! 
<br/></span><span>Ciqoma, tiloma</span><span>!  Look around, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is the new Fiji right here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- This is the freedom that has come in the shape of a grand coalition, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>representing the majority of Fijians who have cried out in one voice that enough is enough.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We were on our own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  To all indo-Fijians who  voted, believing  that lies and racism was 
<br/>spread by FijiFirst candidates, I say to you, you are safe, this is the Government for you.  Honourable 
<br/>Rabuka is the Prime Minister for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Honourable Premila Kumar asked, how different are we? You want 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to know how different we are? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We have seen it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Our honourable Prime  Minister was  waiting  for 60 days for your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader to move out of the official residence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tints on our Government vehicles were removed so that the people can see us riding in

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>141 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Our  honourable  Prime  Minister  was  received  with  open  arms  by 
<br/>Kiribati because he did not do things ‘my way’, he did it the Pacific Way.  Introduction of the Girmit 
<br/>day … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You were promised Deputy Prime Minister position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  … is a real commitment to social cohesion, not just calling us all 
<br/>Fijians.    A  Cabinet  that  speaks  to  the  media  with  transparency  after  their  meetings,  instead  of 
<br/>barricading itself in Level 9, hiding from the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are slowly trying to peel away the layers of corruption built on 
<br/>a  foundation  of  fear.    For  16  years,  this  intricate  network  of  the  Bainimarama  Government  has 
<br/>strangled  local  product  by  implementing  systems,  some  overpriced  fly-by-night  expatriate  had 
<br/>dreamed of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the majority of Fijians have put their trust on this side of Parliament, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to change things from the way they were.  The key word is ‘trust’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  carry  out  a  full  audit,  the  Coalition  Government  has  had  to  appoint  people  in  acting 
<br/>positions that we trust who will carry out the work.  Our Government is well within our power to 
<br/>appoint these acting positions so, please, stop berating the Government about that, as we await the 
<br/>application and tender processes for those positions and do the job the public expects from them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, I am finally ready to do the job, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, the public has entrusted me with.  The Ministry is one of the most critical 
<br/>Government institutions as it addresses the needs of those who are marginalised in our society. Our 
<br/>mandate  is  to  care  for  children,  support  families  in  need,  empower  women  and  promote  gender 
<br/>equality and provide services for older persons and persons with disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together with  over 200 registered women’s groups  and organisations, the Ministry serves 
<br/>over 90,000 clients through the various social protection programmes which includes the Poverty 
<br/>Benefit Scheme, Social  Pension Scheme, Care  and Protection Programme, Bus  Fare Scheme  and 
<br/>Rural Pregnant Mothers Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My passion for this Ministry is the reason, Madam Deputy Speaker, I requested it, and not 
<br/>the  request  for  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  And  it  stems  from  my  deep  commitment  to  promote 
<br/>women’s leadership and empowering women and girls to live safe and violence free lives. I am also 
<br/>a firm advocate for children and I am determined to raise their visibility, and ensure that they are 
<br/>given the opportunities they deserve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I embark on this new journey, I am honoured to be co-ministering with honourable Sashi 
<br/>Kiran, who will be leading our efforts towards poverty alleviation.  I view her not as an assistant but 
<br/>as  a  partner  who  brings  a  wealth  of  knowledge  and  experience  to  the  table.  And  after  seeing  the 
<br/>condition the previous Government has left us in, I could certainly do with all the help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  our  children  are  the  very  foundation  of  our  future  and  their 
<br/></span><span>protection is of the utmost importance.  As a nation, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to 
<br/></span><span>ensure that every child is safe, nurtured and empowered to reach their full potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  achieve  this,  our  Ministry  plans  to  establish  a  specialised  Department  of  Children, 
<br/>hopefully in the next budget, that is fully equipped and prepared to uphold the commitments outlined 
<br/>in our laws and regulations.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through rigorous training and education, we must ensure that parents, caregivers and leaders 
<br/>are fully aware of their responsibilities and obligations to protect and support our children.  Of course, 
<br/>we cannot do this alone.  It is imperative that we work in partnership with Government Ministries 
<br/>and civil society, to ensure we raise the visibility of children and keep up with our obligations under 
<br/>the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji is in crisis.  Our women and girls are living in fear everyday, 
<br/>facing violence and discrimination in both, public and private spaces.  This is not just a statistic; it is 
<br/>a heart-breaking reality.  Two out of three women have experienced physical or sexual violence in 
<br/>their lifetime.  Four out of five children in Fiji face some form of violence.  Women with disabilities 
<br/>and diverse sexual orientations and gender identities suffer even more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tradition or beliefs that women are limited to unpaid care work and keep them out of the 
<br/>workforce are holding us back as a society.  Fijian women spend up to 80 hours a week on unpaid 
<br/>care work and only 46 percent are in the labour force.  The women who are employed often face 
<br/>insecure, low paying jobs and no social protections.  Our girls and women are also disproportionately 
<br/>affected by climate-related disasters and have limited access to emerging digital and technical fields.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And to make matters worse, Madam Deputy Speaker, reproductive cancers, such as breast 
<br/>and cervical cancer are the leading causes of death for Fijian women, particularly iTaukei women.  
<br/>In  fact,  Fiji  has  the  second  highest  breast  cancer  mortality  rate  in  the  world.    This  is  simply 
<br/>unacceptable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must prioritise the launch and effective implementation of the Fiji National Action Plan 
<br/>to  prevent  violence  against  all  women  and  girls.    This  whole  of  Government  plan  will  focus  on 
<br/>stopping violence before it starts and will address violence against women and girls holistically in all 
<br/>aspects of public and private life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also develop Fiji’s first-ever Women Economic Empowerment National Action Plan 
<br/>which will focus on unpaid care, the informal economy, property and assets, digital and financial 
<br/>inclusion, education and future jobs, entrepreneurship, and more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But to create effective policies, Madam Deputy Speaker, we need adequate data and gender 
<br/>statistics.  That is why I prioritised the review and finalisation of the Fiji Country Gender Assessment 
<br/>which is the only one of its kind in the Pacific with relevant ethnicity desegregated data - something 
<br/>that was not available or made available by the previous Government sitting on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issues need interest and contributions of our women and girls in all diversity must be 
<br/>counted.    We  must  also  invest  in  institutional  capacity  development  and  establish  effective 
<br/>coordination  and  accountability  mechanisms  to  advance  gender  equality  across  all  Government 
<br/>Ministries and all decision-makers.  Madam Deputy Speaker, we cannot continue to turn a blind eye 
<br/>to these issues.  It is time for action now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the Opposition likes to taunt us on how we have addressed those problems in the very 
<br/>short  time  we  have  been  in  office.    I  was  particularly  amused,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  by  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Bulitavu stating that we were in Government by default, which I really found amusing 
<br/></span><span>because of his own position as a permanent default Opposition Member.  I look forward to seeing 
<br/>what kind of mayhem he will cause in his new Party.  Look out for it FijiFirst Party! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some of the work we have done in the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- How many parties? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is why I am on this side, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You destroyed all the parties.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in the spirit of transparency to the public, 
<br/>let me share with you on some of the work we have done at the Ministry in this first 55 days, sifting 
<br/>through the mess, wastage and overspending that the previous Government has left us with.  One of 
<br/>the first changes I made when we came into the Ministry …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We, we.  Listen to your Assistant Minister! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is really amazing that that they have discovered the word “we”, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker.  That is progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  discovered  that  the  families  of  unvaccinated  deceased  persons  could  not  access  their 
<br/>$1,000 funeral benefit.  However, Madam Deputy Speaker, within three weeks, we renegotiated with 
<br/>Fiji Care Insurance requirements and removed this requirement and backdated it to 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next challenge we faced was discovering that the staff had not been paid overtime. Upon 
<br/>further investigation, we found that a lot of the overtime had been accumulated in  the months of 
<br/>November and December.  I wonder, why? It must have been election time. Whether or not these 
<br/>overtime  hours  were  due  to  campaigning,  what  was  frustrating  is  that,  the  money  that  was  being 
<br/>assigned by the previous Government when they have a shortfall of overtime have come from the 
<br/>programmes themselves.  They have reallocated in the previous Government, to move monies from 
<br/>rural pregnant mothers to pay for operational costs.  That, we have put a stop to, Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- So? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- That’s what you people did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- How can they move money from a Social Programme to cover for 
<br/>operational costs and wastage.  We have put a stop to this.  Have you heard that? We have put a stop 
<br/>to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have appealed to the honourable Minister of Finance to give us overtime money and he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has kindly refused, and we will just have to work with what we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Oh, he refused? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is how a Government is supposed to work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Paisa nahi hai</span><span>.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Social Pension Scheme had a shortfall 
<br/>of $3 million. These shortfalls carried on into Bus Fare Programmes which the short-sighted FijiFirst 
<br/>Government had rushed to implement before the Elections without realising the disastrous impact 
<br/>that automatic top-ups would have on the budget. Yes, the budget we have inherited.  For that reason, 
<br/>we will change the system to a user-pay system and not accumulation-based.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the biggest changes in our Ministry that we plan to do, Madam Deputy Speaker, is to 
<br/>convert the $50 food voucher to cash. Why? Because it has been monopolised by one supermarket – 
<br/>Max Value Supermarket.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Max  Value  Supermarket  have  since  2021,  received  nearly  $14  million,  Madam  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, from the Government for this Food Voucher Scheme. It has forced majority of our recipients 
<br/>to go to Max Value Supermarket and not able to shop anywhere else.  This is meant exactly that, that 
<br/>they can no longer be able to go to the market and buy fruits and vegetable.  That $50 voucher can 
<br/>only be redeemed at Max Value Supermarket.  This will no longer be the case, they should have the 
<br/>freedom to choose where they shop and spend their money at other places. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the focus this year will be on developing our welfare graduation 
<br/>programme,  which  has  really  been  defunct.    There  have  literally  been  hardly  any  social  welfare 
<br/>recipients  moved  from  the  programme  into  something  that  is  meaningful  for  them.    So,  we  are 
<br/>committed to this.  We would like to move our social welfare recipients who are able-bodied, who 
<br/>have been on the programme for unemployment or other reasons, into a more self-sufficient way of 
<br/>life.

<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, by the end of our term, we vow to move our country away from the 
<br/>hand-out  mentality  that  has  been  created  by  FijiFirst,  into  a  hands-on  commitment  to  our  shared 
<br/>future. We must all work together to create a better, safer and more equal Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>145 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Members, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>bula vinaka, namaste, salaam walekum</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a very special moment for me to stand here in this Parliament 
<br/>Chamber as the youngest Member of Parliament, where our collective future of all our people and, 
<br/>indeed, our country is decided upon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as I took oath on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December last year, I pledged to serve my 
<br/>people  and  my  country  and  protect  the  Constitution  to  the  best  of  my  ability  as  a  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament and as a FijiFirst representative under the stewardship of honourable Bainimarama, the 
<br/>leader  who  single-handedly  got  more  than  130,000  votes  in  the  recent  Election  -  the  single  most 
<br/>popular candidate by far.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, at this juncture, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my 
<br/>parents, my family in Savusavu, Bua and Labasa and abroad for their support; my campaign team 
<br/>members in Vanua Levu and Viti Levu for their commitment towards the entire Election campaign; 
<br/>my friends and well-wishers and not forgetting our youth and voters who supported the FijiFirst Party 
<br/>during the 2022 General Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam, Deputy Speaker, I also wish to extend a special thank you to the FijiFirst General 
<br/>Secretary and former Attorney-General, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who has been my inspiration, who 
<br/>had confidence in me and who has encouraged me to be very strong in my passion for politics and 
<br/>serve all Fijians.  Without the guidance and encouragement of the former Prime Minister and former 
<br/>Attorney-General, I would not be standing here today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would not have had this remarkable opportunity had it not been 
<br/>for the revolution led by the former Prime Minister over the course of the last 15 years.  During one 
<br/>of the nation’s darkest periods, the former Prime Minister emerged with  the vision as well as the 
<br/>strength and determination to steer Fiji towards genuine democracy, prosperity, stability and certainty 
<br/>with  nine years of straight  economic growth; with more  Fijians of every  background  educated  at 
<br/>primary, secondary and  tertiary levels  than ever  before in  our history; and with  unity, equity and 
<br/>equality for all our people.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Madam  Deputy  Speaker, it seems  that the Coalition  Government  have made the decision 
<br/>amongst themselves to put all their focus on being petty and targeting FjiFirst policies rather than 
<br/>being a responsible Government themselves.  Many of their actions so far have been self-serving, 
<br/>irresponsible, unconstitutional and illegal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in many countries when there is a change of government, the new 
<br/>government embraces the civil servants and its constitutional officers and works with them, uniting 
<br/>all people under the banner of patriotism, national growth and socio-economic development. Instead 
<br/>of doing that, the honourable Prime Minister and his team have decided to threaten and force many 
<br/>civil servants to resign and have discontinued their contracts wherever they could.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  these  are  professional  people  who  have  years  and  years  of 
<br/></span><span>experience, such as Mr. Pene Baleinabuli, who has served as a loyal and highly efficient civil servant 
<br/>since  2006  and  was  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Fisheries  and  Forests  before  his  removal.    Mr. 
<br/>Baleinabuli, in a statement, said that the discontinuation of his contract was based entirely on the 
<br/>Government’s preference and not on performance.  This is both, sad and sickening.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is just one example of many of our citizens across the country being victimised simply 
<br/>because they were appointed through a transparent process when a different government was in place.  
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wonder what honourable Prasad and NFP have to say about this witchhunt 
<br/>which are being conducted in the manner of the 1987 days and many against our Fijian people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The former Supervisor of Elections was illegally stopped from leaving for overseas for a short 
<br/>break, Madam Deputy Speaker.  He was stopped from flying to see his own family.  We have all 
<br/>seen  the  statement  by  the  former  Supervisor  of  Elections  as  to  how  he  was  illegally  and 
<br/>unconstitutionally detained.  This stop departure was allegedly ordered by our honourable Attorney-
<br/>General, honourable Turaga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  these  people  are  so  petty  that  they  even  illegally  victimised  the 
<br/>person  who  conducted  an  election  from  which  they  formed  the  government.    This  is  the  same 
<br/>honourable Turaga who had to be corrected by his own Prime Minister when he made comments 
<br/>about changing the Constitution which were incorrect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has talked a lot about reviewing Fiji being a secular State, I 
<br/>wonder, Madam Deputy Speaker, if honourable Professor Biman Prasad, honourable Charan Jeath 
<br/>Singh, honourable Agni Deo Singh and honourable Sashi Kiran understand what their overlords at 
<br/>People’s Alliance are saying.  Yet, honourable Professor Biman Prasad and his NFP continue to say 
<br/>nothing, essentially selling out the small number of Fijians who voted for them and, indeed, selling 
<br/>out Hindus all over the world.  It is no surprise, and I repeat, it is no surprise that Mr. Narendra Modi 
<br/>gave him a goose step in India and did not even meet him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No guts, Madam Deputy Speaker, that is the legacy of the National Federation Party and no 
<br/>doubt the brave founders of the Party are turning in their graves right now.  But who knows, perhaps 
<br/>honourable Professor Biman Prasad believes that society is becoming immoral because people of all 
<br/>faiths are allowed to participate in free religious practice.  Maybe that is why his Party is silent while 
<br/>their own voters suffer with the rest of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Sir, this attack on secularism is uncalled for. A secular State means 
<br/>that the government is neutral and all faiths can be practised freely without any discrimination, yet 
<br/>the same 1987 tactics used to divide our people are once again being used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, no one, and I repeat, no one is a threat to Christianity or any other 
<br/>religion.  It is the honourable Prime Minister’s coalition creating these thoughts and this narrative 
<br/>that is causing division and fear, but this is no surprise because the past speaks for itself in today’s 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meanwhile,  the  international  community  is  silent,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.    Meanwhile 
<br/>Heike  Alefsen,  Regional  representative  for  the  Pacific,  UN  Human  Rights  Office  is  silent;  Mr. 
<br/>Sanaka, Resident Coordinator for the United Nations is silent; the Australian, New Zealand, United 
<br/>Kingdom,  United  States  and  Indian  Embassies  are  silent;  our  media  who,  for  years,  falsely  cried 
<br/>about media restriction is silent.  Why would they not be silent?  Why would they not?  Half of them 
<br/>are public relations experts for PAP and NFP, while the other half are afraid, like Mr. Mohammed 
<br/></span><span>Saneem  and  Mr.  Pene  Baleinabuli  who  will  be  illegally  victimised.    A  real  climate  of  fear  has 
<br/></span><span>descended on Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, listen to this, Madam Deputy Speaker, an outspoken feminist and well-known human 
<br/>rights  defender  was  picked  up  by  CID  twice  and  interviewed  for  hours  for  allegedly  spreading 
<br/>misinformation about the assault of a person brought into a police station.  What a ludicrous thing to 
<br/>do for such a petty reason.  Again, this is done under one of honourable Professor Prasad’s Party 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>147 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>members, honourable Tikoduadua, who like our honourable Leader pointed out correctly, appears to 
<br/>be like the </span><span>de facto</span><span> Police Commissioner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Do not say appears. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- It does not matter to NFP now, Madam Deputy Speaker, though because 
<br/>they have their black cars with red lights.  Power is all they ever wanted, it seems.  As highlighted 
<br/>by honourable Bala on Monday, this Government has failed to deliver what they have promised.  Let 
<br/>us shed some light on their promise to remove all TELS loans that students had.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I tried to find another way to say this but there is no other way.  
<br/>Honourable Rabuka, honourable Gavoka and honourable Professor Biman Prasad lied to the Fijian 
<br/>students and youth.  There is no other way to put it.  They promised that TELS debt will be removed, 
<br/>they have not done it. They lied, they are not going to remove TELS and they know it, and those who 
<br/>were tricked by the Coalition Government are devastated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, time is running out for the Coalition Government to make good on 
<br/>their first 100-day promises.  It seems that PAP is trying to get as many of their promises across the 
<br/>table while NFP and SODELPA sit back subserviently and have become mere spectators.  In some 
<br/>places of the world, that would be called cowardice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would also like to highlight that the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>proudly announced that Ajay Amrit is his friend. Then after advertising for people to apply for Board 
<br/>positions, he appointed his friend to the FBC Board without even waiting for the end date of the 
<br/>advertisement period - blatant cronyism. They do not even care. Well, in his first act, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister’s friend held an expensive cocktail party where he unveiled the worst logo, perhaps 
<br/>ever in the history of logos.  I repeat, the worst logo ever in the history of logos.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What made it worse, Madam Deputy Speaker? The logo was a free picture 
<br/>licensed icon, slightly changed and inverted.  Our young, technologically savvy and educated youth 
<br/>picked up FBC’s deceit almost immediately and FBC quickly became the butt of all jokes across the 
<br/>country.  The new FBC Board just days into their reign have proven that they are incompetent.  On 
<br/>social media even the Coalition’s most ardent supporters made fun of Amrit’s new FBC.  The new 
<br/>FBC, by the way, is giving almost zero coverage to our statements - so much for media freedom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  I  ask  honourable  Professor  Biman  Prasad,  are  you  alright  with  all  these?  Are  you 
<br/>alright with our national broadcaster becoming a circus - a laughing stock?  The first action for PAP’s 
<br/>new Board Chairman, Ajay Amrit, was to make the organisation look incompetent and amateur, but 
<br/>what is most telling, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that many of the staff could tell that it was a really 
<br/>bad  choice  but  due  to  the  culture  of  fear  they  could  not  speak  out.    That  is  just  one  example  of 
<br/>incompetence and culture of fear that we can expect to increase in future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, all I have to say to the people of Fiji is to stay tuned. The aspiration 
<br/></span><span>of  our  people  is  embodied  in  the  Fijian  2013  Constitution.    It  is  the  very  physical  object  and 
<br/></span><span>metaphysical symbol that makes all of us as Members of Parliament the custodians of Fiji’s future, 
<br/>a future where all Fijians are treated equally, a future where the rule of law is adhered to, a future 
<br/>where every Fijian regardless of gender, race, religion or age has the opportunity to pursue their true 
<br/>potential.  This is the future of Fiji that the 2013 Constitution aspires to and sets the stage for us to 
<br/>achieve.  The  Government  must  respect  its  significance  and  not  pursue  short-term  agenda 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accomplishments  by  circumventing  it  and  worse  -  long-term  damage  to  this  nation  by  trying  to 
<br/>change the contents of the Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I implore the Coalition which is made up of three smaller parties 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not to be petty and try to change our beloved Constitution which is the legacy of the Republic of the 
<br/>Fiji Military Forces and the FijiFirst Government.  We all swore an oath to protect the Constitution 
<br/>during  our  swearing  in  ceremonies.  Please,  do  not  become  oath  breakers  -  a  terrible  sin  in  every 
<br/>religion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to be standing here today as we work together to 
<br/>shape  the  future  of  our  beloved  nation.    We  want  to  move  forward  but  we  cannot  because  the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  continues  to  breach  the  Constitution  and  disregard  the  rule  of  law.  Some 
<br/>people on the ground  are now  calling  them the illegal  Coalition or the backward Government.   I 
<br/>would like to remind my colleagues in this august Parliament that our ultimate goal must be the well-
<br/>being of the people of Fiji.  Every decision we make must be guided by this principle and we must 
<br/>be accountable to our people in all that we do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am proud to be a member of FijiFirst - a Party that has a proven 
<br/>track record of delivering on its promises for years and here on the other side, we have a Coalition 
<br/>Government  that  cannot  achieve  even  their  first  100-days  promises.    Our  Leader,  honourable 
<br/>Bainimarama has worked tirelessly over the years to bring about real change in the lives of ordinary 
<br/>Fijians and I believe with his continued leadership, we can achieve great things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I would like to say that I am deeply committed to serving the people of Fiji 
<br/>and protecting the Constitution that has always protected us and I will do everything in my power to 
<br/>ensure that their voices are heard in this Parliament.  No matter how this Coalition Government likes 
<br/>to spin it, the truth of their incompetence and infighting just like the downfall of the FBC brand in 
<br/>just a few days, will be shown to the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I fully expect it and if we are truly people who value our country, 
<br/>who are truly patriotic and who want Fiji to grow and for our people to prosper, we will do what we 
<br/>must to create a better future.  And  to  the  people  of  Fiji,  I  say  to  them,  we  have  done  so  many 
<br/>complicated things without an issue and this new Government on the other side is showing that they 
<br/>cannot  even  do  easy  things,  how  will  they  build  our  future?    I  strongly  believe  we  are  moving 
<br/>backwards  under  this  Government,  but  now,  we  on  this  side  will  never,  I  repeat  Madam  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, never rest until we forge the future that we believe is the best for all our Fijians.  May God 
<br/>bless all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, Members of Parliament, invited guests and those that are tuning in to the live

<br/>His Excellency the President, for his most gracious Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I also take this opportunity to congratulate you and the </span><span>Turaga Bale 
<br/>na Tui Cakau </span><span>for your appointments as Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively.  I trust that these 
<br/>appointments  have  been  made  considering  your  capabilities  to  discharge  your  responsibilities 
<br/>diligently.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, please allow me to acknowledge and thank the Almighty God, the 
<br/>creator of the universe for his divine calling upon me into the annals of Fijian leadership history.  I 
<br/>am grateful to His Excellency for his assurance of the Government mission to build unity through 
<br/>social cohesion that will further improve and strengthen our economy through sustainable growth 
<br/>with the ultimate objective of improving the lives of all the people of Fiji.  I am also grateful to His 
<br/>Excellency for his further assurance that there must be a clear focus on the rule of law and democratic 
<br/>processes which includes transparency, accountability, respect for human rights and freedoms, and 
<br/>listening to the views of the people through general consultations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  am  deeply  humbled  with  my  appointment  by  the  People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government as the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways.  Thank you, honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, for your trust in me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me turn to my task as Minister for Agriculture and Waterways.  
<br/>At this juncture, let me acknowledge my predecessors in the FijiFirst Government; the honourable 
<br/>Inia  Seruiratu  and  my  good  friend,  Dr.  Mahendra  Reddy  for  their  contribution  to  agriculture 
<br/>development over the last 16 years.  The Ministry has the mandate to ensure that all Fijian citizens 
<br/>have access to safe and nutritious food while farmers enjoy guaranteed incomes from local produce 
<br/>and export market sales. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, Madam Deputy Speaker, also spearheads the efforts of the various stakeholders 
<br/>in the agriculture sector in their fight to increase contribution to Fiji’s economic growth.  In addition 
<br/>to  this,  the  Ministry  also  has  the  national  mandate  to  look  after  our  waterways  by  way  of  rivers, 
<br/>streams, coastline and the major drainage and creeks in Fiji.  To guide this mandate, the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture has in place a 5-year Strategic Development Plan 2019-2023, envisioning a competitive, 
<br/>sustainable  and  resilient  agriculture  sector.    This  SDP  is  intricately  linked  to  the  5-year  National 
<br/>Development Plan that inculcates the need to have food and nutrition security through increased and 
<br/>improved production methods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  to  this  end,  the  Ministry  has  in  place  agriculture  development 
<br/>programmes budgeted for in the public sector investment programme that addresses specific areas to 
<br/>enhance crop and livestock production.  These areas include mechanisation for large scale crop and 
<br/>livestock  production,  provision  of  planting  materials,  improvement  of  livestock  breeds  and 
<br/>infrastructural support, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President in his Address stated the importance 
<br/>of  inclusive  agricultural  policies  for  young  people  and  women  to  be  strengthened  along  with 
<br/>development  of  specific  commodities.    In  addressing  the  above,  the  Ministry  has  developed  an 
<br/>agenda in the Agriculture Policy 2022-2027 that ensures equality of access to economic resources 
<br/>required for productive and resilient agricultural markets.  The Ministry has also developed a Youth 
<br/>in Agriculture Policy with the view to empower and incentivise young people to actively participate 
<br/>in all aspects of the agri-food system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there is a need to  encourage local farmers to work in clusters or 
<br/>better  still,  form  registered  co-operatives  to  address  inconsistency  in  supply  to  the  markets  and 
<br/></span><span>strengthen their bargaining power.  This has been rightly stated by His Excellency the President as a 
<br/></span><span>way to facilitate access to markets, finance training and technology to promote regional economic 
<br/>growth, enhance competitive strength through advanced specialisation of agriculture production and 
<br/>increase each cluster member’s income.  The long-term  vision is  to  value-add  commodities, both 
<br/>crop and livestock as part of product diversification in the agriculture sector.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as Minister responsible also for Waterways, it is disheartening to 
<br/>hear  the  cries  of  our  people  regarding  clogged  drains  and  blocked  waterways,  that  often  leads  to 
<br/>flooding after a heavy downpour.  This is the end result of 16 years of plain talk and neglect with no 
<br/>action by the other side of Parliament.  To this end, the Department of Waterways already has its job 
<br/>cut out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Minister, I also have the intention of reintroducing the drainage board schemes.  There 
<br/>have been calls from within the farming, housing and rural communities for this reintroduction to 
<br/>resolve the constant  flooding occurrences.  The Department will continue to focus at the national 
<br/>level on drainage schemes, dredging works and construction of nature-based solution seawalls so as 
<br/>to safeguard food systems, housing, rural economy and ecosystems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me now turn to my maiden speech and with your permission to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliver my opening statement in the vernacular.

<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it would be remiss of me if I fail to acknowledge the many people 
<br/>who contributed to my upbringing on this political journey, in particular, my late father, Mr. Viliame

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cavubati of Vanuavatu, Totoya, Lau who passed away two days after my swearing-in as a Member 
<br/>of Parliament and as a Member of Cabinet in the People’s Coalition Government.  My father, Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, served as an Assistant Minister in the earlier Rabuka-led Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to pay tribute to my late mother, Vila Rayalu Kaunitawake and of my late 
<br/>maternal grandfather the late honourable Tomasi Rayalu Vakatora, who served both as a Cabinet 
<br/>Minister in both the Lower and Upper Houses of during the leadership of </span><span>Na Turaga Bale Na</span><span> </span><span>Tui 
<br/></span><span>Nayau, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to acknowledge my immediate family - my lovely wife Vasiti Tiko Rayalu 
<br/>and our children and my siblings.  I pay tribute to my late younger brother Big Jone Cavubati (JC) 
<br/>who  passed  away  last  year.    Thank  you  for  being  there  at  the  start  of  this  journey.    To  Big  Bill 
<br/>Cavubati (Jnr), Atama Cavubati, Kitione Vesikula and Tevita Cavubati (my younger brothers and 
<br/>your families) </span><span>malo a veitokoni</span><span>.  To my extended Tau Ethan, many thanks for your moral support 
<br/>and prayers, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to one and all for your most valuable support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to particularly thank the people of Raiwai and Raiwaqa 
<br/>where I was brought up for the most part of my life for their support during the elections.  To the 
<br/>young people, the youth of Raiwai and Raiwaqa, I say “stay focussed on your dreams”.  If I can make 
<br/>it, you can also do it.  I would also like to thank my relatives of the </span><span>Yavusa o</span><span> Waimaro, Vanuavatu 
<br/>of Nasavu Village, Rara, Naitasiri and my relatives of Natokalau Village, Narocake, </span><span>Tikina o</span><span> Nasinu, 
<br/>Ovalau, for your support during the Elections.  You will always remain in my heart.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would also like to sincerely thank all my supporters from wherever 
<br/>you voted for me, throughout Fiji.  I would like to acknowledge the previous government for their 
<br/>16 years of ruling our beloved country, however, I would not be doing any justice to the people of 
<br/>Fiji  if  I  fail  to  mention  the  various  injustices  that  our  people  went  through  from  their  draconian 
<br/>leadership styles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  was  riddled  with  nepotism,  favouritism,  racism,  bullying,  not 
<br/>following the rule of law, muzzling the media, micro-managing and unconstitutional practices.  To 
<br/>that end, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am surprised that the other side of Parliament, beginning with 
<br/>their  leader  can  have  the  audacity  to  even  speak  and  point  to  the  just  past  50  day  old  People’s 
<br/>Coalition  Government  on  these  things  without  first  looking  at  themselves  in  the  mirror.    This  is 
<br/>typical  of their arrogant  and ignorant  character that  we  witnessed for 16 years.  Everyone  else is 
<br/>wrong and they are always right but they will quickly find a scapegoat to blame when something 
<br/>goes wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Members from the other side of Parliament have been 
<br/>accusing the People’s Coalition Government of confusion and the left hand not knowing what the 
<br/>right hand is doing.  It seems that they either have a very short memory or through their ignorance 
<br/>have a selective memory.  Let me refresh the memory of members of the other side on their own state 
<br/>of confusion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most recently the people of Fiji witnessed the biggest confusion of all when the leader and 
<br/></span><span>the </span><span>de facto</span><span> leader of the FijiFirst Party failed to interpret the 2013 Constitution in the appointment 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Constitutional  Offices  Commission  (COC)  resulting  in  their  de  facto  leader  automatically 
<br/>losing his seat in Parliament.  If that was not confusing enough, the statement by their leader that the 
<br/>de facto leader was now going lead the charge from outside Parliament, was even more confusing.  
<br/>What kind of leader leads from outside?  Leadership is either in the front, from the middle but never 
<br/>from the outside.  If you are on the outside,  then you are nothing - short of just being a cheering 
<br/>squad.

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, even if that was a deliberate act, it has now left more than 22,000 
<br/>voters in limbo and in a state of more confusion.  To date we have not heard a single explanation 
<br/>from the FijiFirst Party to their voters on the resignation of their other Members of Parliament, that 
<br/>is confusion for you.  To the other side of the Parliament, I say to you, pride comes before a fall. The 
<br/>people of our beloved country have spoken at the polls and have rejected your leadership because 
<br/>they have had enough of 16 years of your unscrupulous dictatorial nonsense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend His Excellency once again for his most eloquent and 
<br/>gracious address to this august Parliament and support the motion before Parliament.  Floreat </span><span>Viti</span><span>, 
<br/>thank you and may God bless you all and may God bless Fiji.  </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I know honourable Aliki Bia is ready to present his speech 
<br/>but I think we are going to take a break before I ask him to take the podium.  So, honourable Members, 
<br/>afternoon tea is served in the usual place and, please, listen out for the bell.  </span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.00 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of 
<br/>the Opposition, also greetings to those in the gallery and to the thousands watching via television and 
<br/>various social media platforms in Fiji and around the globe; first of all, allow me to congratulate you 
<br/>on your appointment as Deputy Speaker of this august Parliament and also to the honourable Ratu 
<br/>Naiqama Lalabalavu on his appointment as Speaker of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I count myself fortunate, blessed and through the power of the living 
<br/>God, I am able to stand in Parliament and deliver my maiden speech as one of the youngest and new 
<br/>Members of Parliament.  Before I kick start my term as an Opposition Member of Parliament, I feel 
<br/>that it is important for people to know who I am and what is my background. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am proud to say that I am a  </span><span>kai</span><span> Solomoni in Fiji, a direct descendant of the Melanesian 
<br/>labourers who were forcefully brought to Fiji to work as labourers in the late 1800s. My dad, Josua 
<br/>Sade Rabonu was a fourth generation of those Melanesian labourers.  My mother, Mereti Tabuavula 
<br/>Rabonu hails from Burerua, Sawakasa, Tailevu and I am proud to be called a vasu of Daviko where 
<br/>they used to say in the iTaukei dialect, </span><span>keitou kakana na vatu katakata, neitou salusalu na mate </span><span>(we 
<br/>feast on hot rocks, and death is but a garland to us). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would not be standing here today without the votes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of people who trusted me to be their voice and a servant to the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, who would have thought a wheelbarrow boy in the city of Suva will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stand in Parliament 22 years later to deliver his maiden speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Member of Parliament, it is only through the power of God that will take a miracle like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this to happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- </span><span>Emeni</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to mention people who have helped 
<br/>and encouraged me to take the leap of faith and swim in a small river full huge of sharks, I may say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  my  NTK  200  campaign  crew  -  Jayson,  Poni,  Reponi  Bete,  Meli,  Moape,  Jeffrey,  Ta 
<br/>Seyasi, Ta Jone, Amaraki, Tome, Jimilai, Samisoni, Pita, Ulai, Iloa, Ta Samu, Jay Koi, Pat, Talevu 
<br/>Matai, my father-in-law Jimi Vauqaci (Snr) and my namesake Aliki Bia (Senior), thank you for all 
<br/>your endless support and love.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it has been a journey that has brought tears and at times drained us 
<br/>out emotionally and physically but I thank my loving wife, Masilina Ligatabua, and my three children 
<br/>- Bia Junior, Lusiana and Maika for standing by me not matter what. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, spending more than 10 years in the media industry has shaped me 
<br/>to be the person I am today. I would like to thank all media leaders who have helped me along the 
<br/>way. To all the various news heads, thank you for allowing me to learn along the way, I will always 
<br/>be forever grateful and indebted to all of you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the biggest impacts in my life was my spiritual upbringing.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the Anglican Church, the Diocese of Polynesia, the Parish of St. Mark in Nasinu 
<br/>and St. Philip in Nadawa, Bishop-elect, Rev. Sione Uluilakepa, Rev. Eseta Mateiviti Tulavu and her 
<br/>family - thank you for the spiritual guidance and the words of encouragement.  To the many advice 
<br/>of Pastor Manasa Kolivuso of CMF Vuniiviivi, Nausori and to the New Methodist Church family for 
<br/>their never-ending support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  despite  being  a  staunch  Anglican,  the  New  Methodist  Church 
<br/>Fellowship of Pastor Atunaisa Vulaono and Radini Qase Levu Raijeli Vulaono taught me values and 
<br/>character of living life in a godly way.  What amazes me is they never saw religion, race or gender 
<br/>as a barrier to show the love of God to anyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the school that started it all.  Our very own 
<br/>school in Newtown, Nasinu - Bishop Kempthorne Primary School where I started my educational 
<br/>journey.  Thanks to the current hard working head teacher, Joyce Tiko Prasad for doing a tremendous 
<br/>job school at the school and not forgetting all the hardworking teachers, staff and management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the institution that provided the cutting edge and groomed me for 
<br/>any situation in life is the school that I hold dear and close to my heart.  It is none other than Queen 
<br/>Victoria  School.    For  five  years,  I  toiled  the  life  of  a  Victorian,  feeling  the  breeze  of  Nukuvuto, 
<br/>walking the paradise of the promised land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, my utmost gratitude and thanks to the FijiFirst Party and its leader, 
<br/>honourable  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama  for  opening  the  door  of  opportunity  and  having  faith  in 
<br/>people like me to contest the 2022 General Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, having said that, this week’s Parliament sitting marks a new chapter 
<br/>for the history of the </span><span>Solomoni</span><span> and Vanuatu in Fiji that ever since their arrival and the history of this 
<br/>Parliament, I am the first ever direct descendant to ever confirm a seat in this august Parliament and 
<br/>a voice to raise our long-standing issues and our cry for help. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are proud of our heritage and we thank the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>for delivering a Constitution that called everyone “Fijian” and ensured a levelled playing field despite 
<br/>colour, race or gender.  Our fore parents came and built roads, worked in farms and other areas of 
<br/>development and currently we have close to 30 </span><span>Solomoni</span><span> and Vanuatu settlements around Fiji.  To 
<br/>name are few - Newtown, Namara, Caubati, Veiraisi, Tamavua-i-wai, Muanikoso, Tacirua, Matata, 
<br/>Kalekana,  Wailoku,  Navutu,  Nadrala,  Maniyava  (thanks  to  the  </span><span>vanua  </span><span>of  Tokaimalo),  Wainaloka, 
<br/>Wailailai, Baba, Waitovu, Nabunikadamu, Naviavia and Caqiri.  None of these communities have 
<br/>secured land ownership or confirmation of where they reside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as noted by His Excellency’s Address and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“An announcement will make soon on two new public holidays.  This includes a 
<br/>public  holiday  to  commemorate  the  arrival  of  the  Girmitiyas  to  Fiji  in  1879,  whose 
<br/>descendants are an integral part of our nation.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  all  due  respect  to  my  brothers  and  sisters  of  the  Girmitiyas  who  are  in  Parliament, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the question we ask, what about us Melanesians in Fiji?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are descendants of blackbirders, our forefathers were forcefully brought to Fiji.  They did 
<br/>not have any choice.  They were basically tricked into ships and weeks later, they found themselves 
<br/>almost as slaves here in Fiji, but they toiled hard day and night.  Despite their circumstances, hoping 
<br/>that years down the line, many of their generations will call Fiji their home.  In the process of their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>155 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hard labour in farms, building roads and buildings, some of them even lost their lives in the process 
<br/>of trying to give Fiji a better future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we sometimes shed tears remembering what they have done and it 
<br/>hurts even more that we do celebrate their achievements silently because nationally, there is no day 
<br/>approved to commemorate their hard work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we share traditional ties to the people of Lovoni, Moturiki, Namara, 
<br/>Tailevu and Ra, some of the </span><span>mana</span><span> of their traditional ties still exist today.  At times the famous song 
<br/>of the late Jale Mareau lingers within our memory and I quote: “</span><span>Viti ko sa tiko vinaka. O qai nanuma 
<br/>mo biliga lesu tale noqu waqa</span><span>.” (“Now that you are well off Fiji, you now think of casting our boat 
<br/>adrift). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the songs signifies our everyday fear of being one of the landless 
<br/>people in Fiji.  We live day by day with insecurity of not knowing what tomorrow may bring. If we 
<br/>are to bring change, we need to be mindful and at the same time be cautious of the transformation 
<br/>we make.  We need to have the ability to assess our own progress and ensure thorough review of the 
<br/>process and procedures that are in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to remind all honourable Members of this august Parliament, 
<br/>if  it  was  not  for  the  people,  we  will  not  be  sitting  in  Parliament.  If  we  get  hundreds  of  votes  or 
<br/>thousands of votes, we are all here to provide service to the nation and to the people of Fiji and we 
<br/>will have to do it no matter what it takes, most importantly we do it with dignity and honour.  The 
<br/>greatest asset of a Government is not wealth but the people.  Without the people there will be no 
<br/>wealth and that is why it is vital to look at policies and initiatives that will ensure no one is left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji is now a multi-ethnic country, in my view introducing ethnic-
<br/>based policies and ideas will continue to segregate people along ethnic lines.  Love has no barrier, 
<br/>love does not differentiate anyone, love ensures equality irrespective of colour, race or gender. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  my  background,  someone  asked  me  how  I  will  square  off  and  debate  with  other 
<br/>politicians who have vast experience and knowledge.  I did make my stand and intentions clear.  I 
<br/>will not in any way use my authority or power as a Member of Parliament to degrade or speak low 
<br/>of anyone in Parliament, but I will use everything and all avenues that I can do to debate on policies 
<br/>and what I believe is best for the people of Fiji.  I will ensure that whatever is promised to the people 
<br/>of Fiji must be delivered and there is fairness and equality in the services provided to all Fijians. To 
<br/>all Fijians we may differ in our political views and you are free to express your opinion in any way 
<br/>you can.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is not about politics but policies that will matter to the people from 
<br/>all walks of life.  We need to be reminded that we cannot make everyone happy but we can allow 
<br/>ourselves to be a vessel of democracy and be the voice of people in Parliament. As a new politician, 
<br/>I saw there is no need for politicians and Members of Parliament to bombard each other personally 
<br/>on social media platforms. However, we need to engage in positive </span><span>talanoa</span><span> of ideas and policies that 
<br/>will move the nation forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we need to remove self-interest because it was never about us.  We 
<br/>come into this Parliament not because we are academically decorated or well outspoken but because 
<br/>of the people who voted us in and whatever we do, we need to put the people of Fiji before us and 
<br/>do everything in our power to ensure the people are well taken care of.  So, in the spirit of </span><span>talanoa</span><span>, 
<br/>let us move Fiji forward.  May God bless us in this august Parliament and God bless our nation  - 
<br/></span><span>Floreat </span><span>Viti. </span><span>

<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>bula 
<br/>vinaka</span><span> and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, before I contribute to the motion before Parliament, kindly allow 
<br/>me to pay tribute to my late chief, </span><span>na Momo Levu na Tui Vitogo</span><span>, who passed away on 7</span><span>th</span><span> February 
<br/>and will be laid to rest at the chiefly </span><span>Sau Tabu</span><span> this Saturday 17</span><span>th</span><span> February.  Ratu Wiliame Ratudale 
<br/>Sovasova was the Chairman of the </span><span>Bose ni Momo</span><span> Yasana Ba, the council of chiefs of the Ba Province.  
<br/>He was unanimously elected as the first chairman because of his strong leadership.  We, the </span><span>vanua 
<br/>of Vitogo</span><span> remember the late Ratu Wiliame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam, Deputy Speaker, in his letter to all the heads of department on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> January, 2013, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the former Commissioner Western, Mr. Joeli Cawaki wrote and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Please be informed that a directive has been issued by the Prime Minister that all 
<br/>development plans earmarked for the village of Vitogo and Naviyago is to be suspended 
<br/>herewith.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The suspension was made because of Ratu Wiliame’s submission to the Constitution Review 
<br/>Commission  and  when  asked  to  retract  his  statement,  Ratu  Wiliame  refused.    In  response  to  the 
<br/>suspension, Ratu Wiliame told the messenger and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>“Tukuna vua na Turaga na Paraiminisita, ena veisau na matanitu.  Keimami na tiko 
<br/>ga na kai Vitogo.  Raici keimami – keimamu bula volekata ga na veidogo baleta ni

<div><span>Ratu Wiliame lived to see the change of Government on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022.  To my chief, I say, 
<br/>farewell.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to add my congratulations to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji on 
<br/>his outstanding address at the opening of the new session of Parliament.  I also wish to express my 
<br/>appreciation again to the Coalition Government led by the honourable Prime Minister, the Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers and Members of Cabinet for your faith in me in taking up the Minister for Youth 
<br/>and Sports portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam, Deputy Speaker, in His Excellency the President’s opening address, he reminded us 
<br/>that policies for the ongoing development of young people and sports are central to the overall well-
<br/>being of the nation.  The Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that youths have access to 
<br/>knowledge,  skills  and  training  so  that  they  can  effectively  participate  and  contribute  to  nation 
<br/>building.  There is no doubt that the low turnout of youth voters during the 2022 General Elections, 
<br/>was due to lack of interest towards politics.  These young people were disengaged from politics that 
<br/>did not represent them.  Their silence never felt so loud that there is no doubt that the voices of  youth 
<br/>will be heard and will continue to be heard, as I visited the outlying areas of Fiji to hear what the 
<br/></span><span>youths are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After being sworn in as the Minister for Youth and Sports and having taken up this important 
<br/>portfolio, we are pushing hard to strengthen the Ministry’s approach by refocusing our efforts on 
<br/>effectively  delivering  our  services  and  programmes  to  youth  and  sporting  organisations.    We  are 
<br/>pushing to create educated youths - youths who can become advocates on youth related issues and 
<br/>youths who are resourceful.  We have made it our priority to listen to our youths about their training

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs before introducing our services, soft skills and empowerment training programmes for their 
<br/>ongoing development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  will  ensure  that  our  young  people  are  receiving  the  most 
<br/>effective,  suitable  and  relevant  training  so  that  our  youth  can  start  their  own  income  generating 
<br/>projects  to  contribute  to  our  economic  development,  and  help  their  families,  communities  and  of 
<br/>course of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, programmes such as Seeds of Success, multi-skills, mobile skills 
<br/>and youth empowerment training have sown the right positive mentality for young leaders as they 
<br/>make their way along life’s long and bumpy road.  As indicated, the ministry has also been actively 
<br/>engaged in programmes to empower youth to create better livelihoods for themselves.  This we do 
<br/>through our youth grant programmes providing assistance to individual youths and also youth groups 
<br/>operating income generating projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji and fellow Pacific Island nations are among the most vulnerable 
<br/>to  our  changing  climate,  with  many  already  experiencing  higher  temperatures,  shifts  in  rainfall 
<br/>patterns,  rising  sea  levels  and  changes  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  climate  events.  
<br/>Further changes on top of an existing, naturally variable climate are expected long into the future 
<br/>because of global warming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there is credible scientific information available about climate change in the Pacific, 
<br/>applying the information to inform risk management, adaptation planning and associated decision-
<br/>making  for  sectors  including  health,  infrastructure,  water,  energy,  tourism,  food  (fisheries  and 
<br/>agriculture) and natural resources (forestry, biodiversity) is not straightforward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the government realises and acknowledges the need to ensure that 
<br/>our youths are at the forefront of any climate change activity initiatives.  Their passion is precisely 
<br/>what Fiji and the world needs and their activism and ideas will be what finds solutions to the problems 
<br/>that those that have gone before us created. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, at this juncture, I wish to mention that the National Youth Policy is 
<br/>currently being  revalidated and reviewed.   The purpose of the  National  Youth Policy is  to  create 
<br/>conditions for learning, opportunity and experience which will enable youths to develop knowledge, 
<br/>skills and competencies.  This allows young people to be actors of democracy, integrate into society 
<br/>and in particular, play an active role in both civil society and the labour market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry in the review process is consulting with all key stakeholders including youths 
<br/>before we finalise the draft policy for Cabinet to consider and we are looking to complete this process 
<br/>before the  end of 2023.  As an island nation, Fiji  has tremendous potential that is  yet  to  be fully 
<br/>realised.    With  improving  institutions  and  infrastructure,  increased  international  positioning  and 
<br/>recognition and a large number of young people, the Fijian Government is committed to developing 
<br/>conducive policies that provides tactical support systems and  programmes focused at meeting the 
<br/>socio-economic needs of Fiji’s youth and strengthening social inclusion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the government duly recognises sports as an industry as we move 
<br/></span><span>into  this  era  of  sports  professionalism  with  the  need  to  invest  in  developing  our  elite  athletes, 
<br/>increasing our levels of participation in sport and physical activity supported by coaches, technical 
<br/>officials and other specialists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With Government’s inclusive approach, we are also currently reviewing our National Sports 
<br/>Policy  to  promote  the  participation  of  women  and  disabled  persons  in  physical  activities  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>encourage  the  participation  of  all  Fijians  irrespective  of  ethnicity,  gender  or  physical  and  mental 
<br/>ability.  Recognising the influence and importance of sports across our Fijian society, the National 
<br/>Sports Policy sets out our vision for Fijian Sports for 2023 and beyond and defines the actions we 
<br/>will undertake to achieve our ambitious goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Evidence around the contribution of sport and physical activity, Madam Deputy Speaker, to 
<br/>health  and  wellbeing  is  particularly  strong.    A  comprehensive  review  by  the  United  States’ 
<br/>Department  of Health and Human Services concluded that regularly  active individuals had lower 
<br/>mortality rates than the least active and health benefits of being habitually physically active applied 
<br/>to people regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status and whether or not they had a 
<br/>disability.  Echoing  this, Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  research  by  the  Economic  and  Social  Research 
<br/>Institute (ESRI) estimated that regular participation in sport is equivalent in health terms to being 14 
<br/>years younger.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Anti-Doping  Policy  will  also  be  reviewed  with  the  target  to 
<br/>protect the athlete’s right to participate in doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and 
<br/>equality  for  athletes  worldwide.    It  will  also  ensure  harmonized,  co-ordinated  and  effective  anti-
<br/>doping programmes at the national and international levels to detect and prevent doping. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This policy will also establish the Fiji Anti-Doping Agency as an independent body charged 
<br/>with the implementation of World Anti-Doping Code and its international standards in Fiji.  We have 
<br/>all seen the integrity of sport being questioned by recent events taking place in one of the world’s 
<br/>sports powerhouses.  This has potentially corrupted the foundation of sports in the minds of spectators 
<br/>and athletes alike and we cannot afford to let that happen in Fiji.  We continue to tackle corruption 
<br/>with our zero-tolerance approach and this is now being extended to the sports field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to aim high, continue to punch above our weight and look for other opportunities 
<br/>including bidding to host the Pacific Games again as our contribution to the region and host other 
<br/>events.  Our Ministry will work with the Fiji National Sports Commission, Fiji Sports Council and 
<br/>other stakeholders to develop this aspirational strategy in this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Activities  relating  to  sports  and  physical  education,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker  are  essential 
<br/>components of human resource development, helping to promote good health, comradeship and a 
<br/>spirit  of  friendly  competition  which  in  turn  has  positive  impact  on  the  overall  development  of 
<br/>personality of all Fijians.  Excellence in sports enhances the sense of achievement, national pride and 
<br/>patriotism.    Sports  also  provides  beneficial  recreation,  improves  productivity  and  fosters  social 
<br/>harmony and discipline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  currently  reviewing  the  existing  sporting  infrastructure  status  with  key 
<br/>stakeholders prior to recommending to Cabinet key investment priority areas to ensure that Fiji is 
<br/>able to offer world class facilities for our local athletes across our four Divisions, and importantly 
<br/>attract more international sports gatherings and tournaments into our shores with a long term view of 
<br/>establishing Fiji as the sporting hub of the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Madam Deputy Speaker, in light of the above, there is still room for improvement 
<br/></span><span>and I will challenge the Ministry to problem solve, namely we will be putting greater efforts into 
<br/></span><span>making our programmes as inclusive as possible so that all of our young people can learn leadership 
<br/>skills and realise the immense benefits of physical activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  young  people  wherever  they  are,  are  in  one  way  or  another 
<br/>effectively changing our society for the better, contributing to development agenda of their respective 
<br/>communities and surroundings and making a difference.  I say this with confidence as I have seen

<br/>Ratu  Wiliame  Maivalili  Katonivere  for  his  challenging  opening  Address.    I  again,  reaffirm  my 
<br/>unwavering  commitment  to  supporting  all  our  young  people  to  realise  their  full  potential  for  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Colleagues, honourable Members of Parliament and all online and TV viewers; </span><span>bula</span><span> </span><span>vinaka </span><span>and good 
<br/>afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me begin by acknowledging the Giver of life, Jesus Christ, our most esteemed King of 
<br/>Kings and Lord of Lords, whom without, we would not be here today.  And I thank and honour Him, 
<br/>above all else, for His grace on my life and for His words in Jeremiah 1:5 that states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born, I set you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>apart and appointed you a prophet to the nations.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Christian believer, I know I have been placed in this season for a reason and I pledge to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honour God and our people to be the best I must be, for our nation, and for all who call Fiji home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  of  Fiji  for  his  most  gracious  Address,  may  I 
<br/>extend my appreciation to Mr. Speaker and your good self, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me 
<br/>to speak at this point in time, given I was officiating earlier this morning at the opening of the 12</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>World Hindi Conference currently underway at the Sheraton Resort in Nadi.  On that note, may I 
<br/>wish  all  participants  an  enjoyable  conference  and  trust  that  all  bilateral  talks  with  Fiji  will  be 
<br/>successful and mutually beneficial. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency delivered a great reminder at the opening of this 
<br/>new Parliamentary term where he reminded us all on the importance of being united as one nation, 
<br/>and being resolute to work together to bring about a peaceful, prosperous Fiji for all of our people, 
<br/>and I thank him for setting the tone for our journey in the next four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must now pay tribute to the role you will both have now assumed as the newly appointed 
<br/>Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Fijian Parliament - a role I am positive you both will impart with 
<br/>dignity and impartiality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am comforted that having journeyed with you both politically in the last four and eight years 
<br/>since 2014, you both will have amassed a great deal of insight and wisdom in the political affairs of 
<br/>our  nation  and  understand  perfectly,  the  importance  of  encouraging  healing  and  reconciliation  to 
<br/>build a nation that is sustainable and that honours that genuine spirit of democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, no man is an island.  I did not get to assume this Ministerial position 
<br/>by my own might or influence.  I, therefore, wish to acknowledge a few important people and officials 
<br/>who have made my journey into this august Parliament possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the SODELPA Party, its founders, officials, supporters, and prayer warriors 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for being resolute in our efforts to bring democracy to Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  thank  sincerely  my  campaign  team  who  have  been  with  me  since  2014.    It  is  well 
<br/>acknowledged that my  team  - </span><span>Tamai</span><span>  Ratu Peni, Ratu  Tevita Tuisese,  </span><span>Tamai  </span><span>Noa, </span><span>Tamai</span><span> Susana, 
<br/></span><span>Tamai </span><span>Temesia, Paula, Ratu Filimoni and Ana Soqeta, </span><span>Turaga Na i Taukei Waimaro</span><span> and the late 
<br/>Roko Tui Waimaro have been my backbone, toiling day and night with me, travelling the breadth of 
<br/>Fiji and assisting me deliver to the electorate, and as a result, enabling me to return to this august 
<br/>Parliament successfully - three Elections in a row.  </span><span>Manakwa vakalevu na veitokoni vinaka</span><span> (Thank 
<br/>you very much for the wonderful support)</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my wife Sainiana, the saying that behind a successful man is a hard-working woman is an 
<br/>understatement.  I will add to that, behind a leader like me, is a loyal believer and worker - that has 
<br/>been you.  I thank God for your life, and I thank God for women like you, who contribute so much 
<br/>to national development from behind the scene.

<br/>Province of Naitasiri, and all the kin around Fiji, for electing me and for your prayers.  Thank 
<br/>you  very  much  for  your  kind  support.  I  humbly  acknowledge  your  devotion  and  it  is  my 
<br/>promise to serve to the best of my ability to do justice for your faith in me.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, back in  2014,  putting  my  hand up to  represent  the voices of the 
<br/>marginalised was an effort I knew I wanted to dedicate my life to because I believed and still believe 
<br/>that democracy must be represented by the choices and will of people, and not by usurping power. 
<br/>As we can imagine, 2014 set the platform for the return to full democracy that we can claim to have 
<br/>finally achieved, even if it remains in a fragile state.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I pay tribute to all who journeyed with us in all those early years of political loneliness and 
<br/>hardship, we soldiered on and here we are nine years later, very much bruised and in tatters, but still 
<br/>standing.  Today, I acknowledge you all proudly, but I ask us to be patient in our fragile journey in 
<br/>this new democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must not  be  like our prosecutors.  We must be better.  We  must promote healing and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reconciliation.  We must harness rebuilding and regaining our faith.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am most humbled and honoured to address you all in my capacity as the new Minister for 
<br/>Education.  Madam Deputy Speaker, 2023 is going to be a very challenging year, but one that now 
<br/>brings a lot of hope and optimism that as a nation, we can bury the ghosts of fear and disunity, and 
<br/>embrace real dialogue and a shared vision of togetherness to ensure that no vulnerable community is 
<br/>left behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So much has happened that needs our redressing.  We have a new Government saddled with 
<br/>remnants  of  COVID-19  pandemic  and  many  other  challenges  for  the  Coalition  Government  to 
<br/></span><span>address, but the good news is, they are doable. Like the slogan of the famous brand name Adidas, 
<br/></span><span>“Impossible is Nothing”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For our education sector, it has only been a few weeks, however, I can see that we will need 
<br/>a  major  overhaul  in  our  systems,  our  management  structures  and  even  our  curriculum,  to  a  large 
<br/>extent.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, students are not being given the proper priority they deserve because of the mess 
<br/>that has been created when the structure of the Ministry of Education was changed from three Deputy 
<br/>Secretaries  to  one  Head  of  National  Education  and  Service  Delivery  to  provide  support  to  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary.  This led to the uneven distribution of the various Sections to these Heads. For 
<br/>instance, the Head of National Education and Service Delivery had to oversee seven Sections in the 
<br/>Ministry out of the 12.  Just imagine the load this position had to carry overseeing around 12,000 
<br/>teachers and growing, plus an average of 400 non-teaching staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unresolved issues have become synonymous with the Ministry of Education and as a result, 
<br/>disgruntled teachers have sought better opportunities offshore, leaving behind a shortage of skilled 
<br/>and  experienced  staff.    Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  our  students  suffer  when 
<br/>committed and passionate teachers become scarce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  the  former  honourable  Minister  for  Education  has  raised  a  lot  of  criticisms 
<br/>against the Ministry of Education.  Perhaps, it needs to be pointed out to her that she brought teachers 
<br/>from schools to work in the Ministry of Education Headquarters without following due processes, so 
<br/>she is the last one to talk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am not listening to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- On that note, honourable Member, Mr. Leawere is also sending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his regards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank His Excellency the President for highlighting the Coalition 
<br/>Government’s intentions to establish an Education Commission that is intended to review the entire 
<br/>education system in Fiji in order to improve quality teaching and leadership of schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  a  similar  fashion,  a  National  Education  Summit  is  being  planned  for  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education and all its stakeholders, as His Excellency the President highlighted, to open up dialogue 
<br/>and harness proper planning and restructuring of the education sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The challenge, Madam, Deputy Speaker, is not to reflect on the wrongs of the past, but to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>focus on how things can now be improved now and into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, early childhood and primary education lay the foundation for the 
<br/>emotional, social and cognitive development of our children.  It is at these stages that services must 
<br/>reflect quality assurances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a total of 865 Early Childhood Education (ECE) Centres and 736 primary schools 
<br/>around the country and as such, there is teacher shortage at the primary school level.  Right now, we 
<br/>have  335  secondary  school  teachers  who  are  teaching  in  primary  schools,  and  this  should  not  be 
<br/>happening as primary education is a specialised field in itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government policies must be practical.  Whilst the shortage of primary school teachers was 
<br/>being experienced nationwide, primary school teachers were being retired at 55 years when, in fact, 
<br/></span><span>they should have been retained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, another concern is the lack of specialists in the field of Special and 
<br/>Inclusive Education.  All children have the right to an adequate education within an enabling learning 
<br/>environment and to fully participate in all school and community activities and for this reason, the 
<br/>Ministry recognises the need to provide teachers with this specialised skillset to address this shortfall.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations  will  be  carried  out  with  the  Teacher  Training  Institutions,  relevant  Non-
<br/>Government Organisations and donor partners to device strategies to better support and strengthen 
<br/>pre-service and in-service teacher education to meet the needs in these areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in recent days, we have had to review teaching personnel who have 
<br/>spent more than the recommended number of years in a school.  It is imperative that students and 
<br/>schools are injected with new fresh teachers every five to six years or so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyone with longer years in a school must move to new schools to be in line with the Ministry 
<br/>of Education policies.  It is not only good for students, but for teachers and the overall academic 
<br/>performance and quality of learning.  The saying that a new broom sweeps better is a lesson worth 
<br/>noting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  found  that  teachers  have  become  so  complacent,  they  complain  when  they  are 
<br/>expected  to  be  transferred,  promoted,  or  demoted.    Teachers  must  realise  that  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education is the employer and they must respond to policy direction.  Otherwise, as has been noted, 
<br/>many are building their own castles and power bases in schools, and this has resulted in deteriorating 
<br/>results and the learning environment being compromised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  currently  have  175  secondary  schools,  11  of  which  are 
<br/>Government schools.  While student numbers continue to grow over the years, our education sector 
<br/>continues to lose our teachers through resignations and migration to schools overseas.  Mathematics, 
<br/>Computer, Physics, PEMAC, Industrial Arts and Office Technology are some of the subject areas 
<br/>that are in need of teachers.  The limited human resource capacity has adversely affected the quality 
<br/>of education in our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further  to  that,  the  fundamental  setback  for  vocational  training  offered  in  our  secondary 
<br/>schools is that, certificates obtained by the students at the end of their training are not accredited by 
<br/>the Fiji Higher Education Commission.  The institution of the Technical Colleges in Fiji in 2015 was 
<br/>thought to be a solution but rather it became a disastrous failure. These are lessons to be noted and 
<br/>not to be repeated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it would seem that the fate of Technical Vocational Education and 
<br/>Training (TVET) rested  in  the hands of the various Ministers who  had  served during the past  16 
<br/>years.    In  2015,  the  then  Minister  for  Education  introduced  Technical  Colleges,  providing  many 
<br/>students hope to pursue their education in TVET.  However, in 2019, another Minister transferred 
<br/>the ownership of Technical Colleges to Fiji National University (FNU) and finally, the fate of the 
<br/>colleges was sealed in their closure in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The changes not only affected the many students who had joined these Colleges with the hope 
<br/>and dream of building a successful career path, but it also affected more than 100 instructors and 
<br/>trainers who lost their employment statuses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Early warning signs of market failure can be found in Fijian industries that now import labour 
<br/>from countries such as India, the Philippines and Bangladesh.  Today, we have foreign bus drivers 
<br/></span><span>and builders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, despite several strategies made by the former Government, TVET 
<br/>still does not  seem  to  be a popular choice  among secondary school  students  when choosing their 
<br/>tertiary education pathway.  These challenges will be a focus during the National Education Summit, 
<br/>and we will resolve on how to change that.

<div><span>The  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP)  as  a  regional  institution  has  made  significant 
<br/>contributions towards the Fiji labour market.  One of the main priorities of our Coalition Government 
<br/>is to draw up a repayment plan in consultation with the relevant authorities, and gradually reinstate 
<br/>Fiji’s grant contribution to USP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Fiji  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission, will continue to support not only USP, but the other tertiary institutions, like the FNU, 
<br/>in their educational programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports have been received that some Universities are offering academic programmes that 
<br/>suddenly get shelved, leaving students unsure of how to complete their programme of studies.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Education is looking into these issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  the  Coalition  Government  is  still  considering  the  future  programme  for  education 
<br/>support, we pledge not to leave any student behind.  Concerns being raised on students not meeting 
<br/>the cut-off marks to obtain education assistance is one of our priorities to resolve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Higher Education Commission (FHEC) is guided by the Fiji Higher Education Act 
<br/>2008 and the Ministry of Education is reviewing the functions of FHEC, to ensure they promote the 
<br/>development of Fiji as a knowledge-based society.  As part of the review, the Ministry of Education 
<br/>is also looking into the management of the FHEC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  successful  economic,  social  and  political  development  of  a 
<br/>nation rests on the level of investment it gives to its human resources.  This should begin by making 
<br/>sure that we have dynamic, passionate and quality teachers in our schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The removal of the contract system by the Coalition Government has brought relief to civil 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>servants through job security and is expected to boost their confidence and performance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the extension of retirement age to 60 
<br/>years for our staff has openly been welcomed.  This policy will assist retain skills and knowledge 
<br/>and will address teacher shortages.  The Ministry has already received interests from teachers over 
<br/>55 years, who are willing to continue providing their services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When it comes to our teachers, as their employer, the Ministry must also ensure justice and 
<br/>fairness  in  terms  of  promotions.    We,  as  a  Ministry,  must  ensure  that  our  teachers  get  promoted 
<br/>because they have proven themselves in the field of teaching, and do away with assessing people 
<br/>through a job test, sat over a few hours and which do not take into account the number of years of 
<br/>experience one has. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Experience  is  a  catalyst  of  leadership  opportunities.    Unfortunately,  the  high  number  of 
<br/>disciplinary  cases  by  Heads  of  Schools  indicates  that  many  who  have  been  promoted  were  ill-
<br/>equipped and lacked the practical experience needed. This is a flaw in the OMRS system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Additionally,  there  are  cases  where  promotion  of  senior  officers  with  years  of  leadership 
<br/>have been denied under the OMRS Guideline.  In fact, they have been replaced by those with much 
<br/>less or no experience in leadership positions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  while  qualifications  is  integral,  moving  forward,  the  Ministry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>together with relevant stakeholders, including the line Ministries, will review the matrix used for 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>OMRS, in particular the selection criteria for Heads of Schools and post holders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Education,  will  continue  to  provide 
<br/>Transport Assistance, Free Textbooks and Free Education Grant to our ECE, primary and secondary 
<br/>schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I have, no doubt, that the Back to School $200 financial support has 
<br/>been instrumental in adding to the enthusiasm of parents, guardians and the students for the academic 
<br/>Year 2023.  This enthusiasm has been further increased with the repealing of the zoning policy, which 
<br/>has  enabled  the  students  to  get  enrolled  into  the  schools  of  their  choice,  ensuring  that  students’ 
<br/>interests are given due consideration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, reverting of the three-term academic year for schools was a decision 
<br/>taken by the Coalition Government to ensure that schools operate smoothly with a system they are 
<br/>accustomed to, and this has also assisted reduce the financial burden for many. During my discussions 
<br/>with the Suva Retailers Association, the Association members admitted being one of the contributors 
<br/>towards the idea of a four-term model which would have, no doubt, benefitted their retail business.  
<br/>Whilst we acknowledge the financial benefits to our economy, this cannot be the main incentive to 
<br/>having the four-term school calendar as was proposed earlier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in recognising the importance of having consultations with the wider 
<br/>community, I, along with the honourable Assistant Minister and Senior Education Officials have had 
<br/>the first round of consultations with some faith-based organisations, such as the Methodist Church in 
<br/>Fiji, Fiji Muslim League, and management of two schools under the Shree Sanatan Dharm Pratinidhi 
<br/>Sabha of Fiji.  Similarly, we have engaged with the Teachers Unions as we recognise the role they 
<br/>play in the welfare of our teachers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other schools from around the Central and Western Divisions were visited since I took office 
<br/>as  the  Minister  for  Education.    I  also  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  the  School  Management 
<br/>Association of Fiji, and we will continue to meet with all stakeholders. So far, the feedback to these 
<br/>consultations was positive as stakeholders, as they appreciated being provided with the platform to 
<br/>voice their concerns and be part of the decision-making process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, before I take my seat in support of His Excellency’s most gracious 
<br/>Address, I wish to end by saying that our Ministry serves one of our most important clients - our 
<br/>children, who are our future.  Education is one of the most powerful catalysts of social change and 
<br/>control.  The human mind can be illuminated through education, which can also bring new ideas, 
<br/>new light and new directions for growth and progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  honourable  Members  of  this  august  Parliament  not  to  mix  politics  with  policies 
<br/>designed to help uplift the quality of life of our future generation.  With God’s discernment, let us 
<br/>support each other in ensuring that we, as responsible politicians, help in securing the future of all 
<br/>our children through education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, on that note we will continue the 
<br/>replies to His Excellency’s most gracious Address tomorrow and that brings to an end the sitting 
<br/>today.  Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.  </span><span>Vinaka </span><span>and have a good afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
