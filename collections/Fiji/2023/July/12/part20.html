<h3>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- $927,800?</h3>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- $927,800? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- So what is the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Seeking clarification on the figure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Why the increase?  Can you clarify the increase, please?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  If  there  is  an  increase,  it  is  probably  to  meet  the  demands  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>department in terms of investigation, enquiries and travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption, I can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>see $10.1  million has been allocated. So, that confirms that FICAC will remain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is a constitutional body. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am just asking, it will be there because there were a lot of talks that it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will go. So, I am just asking since the allocation is here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is there, it is still alive, it is still breathing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have a similar motion on that, honourable Vijay Nath? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask about the Legal Aid Commission.  If 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anyone has any question prior, I will hold on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Legal  Aid  Commission,  as  you  know  that  we  have  got 
<br/>around 26 to 27 offices in Fiji and more than 200 staff.  If you look at the narrative written by the 
<br/>Ministry, it is very rosy, nice and very true that the Legal Aid Commission provides services to the 
<br/>vulnerable and it is all around Fiji.   I can see a decrease, in fact if you look at my submission there, 
<br/>I request for an increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are seeking clarification?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  One  of  the  things,  if  I  can  just  explain  throughout  the 
<br/>ministries, when we were formulating the Budget, we looked at positions that were vacant and what 
<br/>is the capacity to fill those.  So, on the basis of that, the budgetary allocation is there, we have had a 
<br/>good discussion and we understand the Legal Aid Commission requirements, but we also want to 
<br/>make sure that it is not being abused by people who should not be going there.  That is part of the 
<br/>rationalization, but the funding is enough, that is what the Legal Aid Commission, as part of our

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussion, agreed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  still  insist  that  the  amount  should  be  increased.  
<br/>Looking at the genuine reason that people who cannot afford and the vulnerable people all around 
<br/>Fiji, as I have mentioned earlier.  I believe it is more than 26. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want to speak on your motion now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I still stick to my motion that we should increase so that the services are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provided to the people who cannot afford.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Move your motion now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I have already moved my motion, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I would like to second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, just repeating, as I have mentioned earlier, if you look at 
<br/>the  narrative  under  Legal  Aid  Commission,  it  provides  free  legal  services  to  the  members  of  the 
<br/>public by giving advice, providing legal representation in court and other related services to Fijians 
<br/>who cannot afford them.  It continues to expand and extend the services around the country with 
<br/>branches in rural and remote areas.  As I have mentioned, we have got more than 27 offices with 
<br/>more than 200 staff and I still believe that there should be an increase or keep to whatever it was in 
<br/>the last financial year.  As you can see, it has been decreased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am not sure why honourable Nath wants to insist because as 
<br/>I said to him, we had a very good discussion with the Legal Aid Commission.  They agreed with this 
<br/>budget, they have a plan, they are being audited for 2022 and 2023 which will finish by 31</span><span>st</span><span> October.  
<br/>They are very happy with the budget, so I do not know on what basis you are asking for an increase, 
<br/>what  is  your  rationale,  I  cannot  understand  that.    Mr.  Chairman,  all  I  can  say  is  that  Legal  Aid 
<br/>Commission  is  happy  with  the  budget,  they  agreed  to  the  reduction  and  we  understand  their 
<br/>requirement well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- We put it to the vote, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Nath, your second motion is still here.  Another one to do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I think I will withdraw that because it has been dealt with.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, mine is relative to the Fijian Competition and Consumer 
<br/></span><span>Commission (FCCC).  The FCCC’s budget had been reduced by some hundred odd thousand dollars. 
<br/></span><span>Bearing in mind that there is an increase in VAT et cetera and their activities … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- … will increase and they have a core function within our society.  I just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wanted to know why the allocation has been reduced so much.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1425 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member is right FCCC has an 
<br/>important role, especially to ensure that policies, especially tax policies are effectively implemented.  
<br/>Although they want to do a lot of other things like, conference, research which we support, but in 
<br/>this  Budget,  we  have  tried  to  hose  that  down  a  little  bit.    We  are  saying  rationalise  the  funding 
<br/>activities and we believe that the funding is quite appropriate for this particular financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is an increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, it is n increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, still on FCCC, the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/>Affairs, we met with FCCC and this is to do with the regulation services that needs to come out of 
<br/>EFL, like licensing of wiremen and electricians.  That particular function needs to go to FCCC.  We 
<br/>were very concerned with the amount of fire incidents that we see in the country, which is caused by 
<br/>bad  workmanship  or  poor  quality  electrical  items  coming  into  the  country.    Our  concern  is  that 
<br/>regulatory function has really not been taken care of by the FCCC because of the funding.  They have 
<br/>been requesting for more money so that the regulatory arm can be established.  What we see here is 
<br/>rather than an increase there is a decrease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- No, there is an increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, there is an increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Sorry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The other thing that  I just wanted to  say  is,  some of these 
<br/>independent commissions and bodies in the absence of Higher Salaries Commission, and because 
<br/>they  are  independent  bodies,  what  we  have  noticed  is  that,  sometime  the  expenses  can  be  quite 
<br/>extravagant so we are trying to rationalise some of those.  The increase that we have given, I think is 
<br/>sufficient and will allow them to effectively do any additional work they might be required to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, just a last question related to the same thing.  If you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can tell us exactly by how much the increase have been made? 
<br/></span></div>
