<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That pursuant to Standing Order 129 that the Emoluments Committee be established 
<br/>to review the salaries and allowances of Members of Parliament as provided for under the 
<br/>Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014, and the Emoluments Committee must report back to 
<br/>Parliament at the September Sitting.   The Members of the Emoluments Committee as agreed 
<br/>to by both sides of the House shall comprise the following –

<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Lynda D. Tabuya;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Ro Filipe Q. Tuisawau;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Aseri M. Radrodro;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Alvick A. Maharaj; and  
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. Mosese D. Bulitavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular motion has been brought about in 
<br/>agreement with the Opposition as to the need to review the salaries and allowances of Members of 
<br/>Parliament. There have been Cabinet decisions made already before this particular Committee was 
<br/>to sit which includes the reduction of allowances of Members of Cabinet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  there  are  discussions  with  Opposition  regarding  the  entitlements  of 
<br/>Members of Parliament.  This also includes pensions, as well as other allowances such as housing 
<br/>that  have  been  raised  not  just  for  Members  of  Government  but  also  Opposition  and  also  former 
<br/>Members  of  Government  and  Opposition.    Mr.  Speaker,  because  these  discussions  have  been 
<br/>happening, there is a need to convene the Emoluments Committee because there are requirements 
<br/>under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 that need to be reviewed accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This motion is being brought to the House, Mr. Speaker, for the Members to support and we 
<br/>have some time where Members of Parliament can make submissions to the Committee, as well as 
<br/>the Committee itself will look to engage independent individuals or experts that can review what is 
<br/>currently entitled by Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To that end, Mr.  Speaker, I ask the Members of the House to support this and that we will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reporting back in the September sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, just on the technicality of this particular motion that 
<br/>is moved, we do not oppose this motion but being in Emoluments Committee, before we are strictly 
<br/>guided by what is part of the motion itself. In this one, though we will be reviewing the pension, 
<br/>however, pension does not fall under the Remuneration Act. There is a Pensions Act 1989 which I 
<br/>believe should be incorporated in this particular motion so that the Emoluments Committee has the 
<br/>powers to review that particular Act as well. Otherwise, we will be facing some issues when it comes 
<br/>to Pensions Act 1989. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, that is an issue that 
<br/>has been raised. We need to include another legislation there. You only have one legislation in your 
<br/>motion here and that is to do with the Parliamentary Remunerations Act. The other one is to do with 
<br/>Pensions Act 1989 since you have mentioned pension in your statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, if I can just clarify this; I know the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister will also speak. The history of the current salaries and allowance for Members of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and Ministers was done after the General Elections in 2014.  The Interim Government, in 
<br/></span><span>the Constitution, it was a requirement or it was allowed that until the first sitting of the Parliament 
<br/>after the first General Election, the Interim Government could make Decrees and pass laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, after the Election, there was a Decree which sets the allowances and salaries of Members 
<br/>of  Parliament,  Ministers  and  Assistance  Ministers.  That  then  became  an  Act  of  Parliament  under 
<br/>which  the  salaries,  benefits,  allowances  and  pensions  which  was  a  separate  Act  was  determined 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Establishment &amp; Membership - Emoluments Committee  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1303 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because the pension, Mr. Speaker, invariably is based on the salaries that honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament and Ministers receive, so it is linked.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know,  by  determination,  there  is  a  salary  reduction  of  20  percent  at  the  moment.  For 
<br/>example, honourable Opposition Members, instead of getting $50,000, they are getting $40,000.  The 
<br/>Ministers and the Prime Minister and everyone on this side have also through determination on a 
<br/>reduced salary of 20 percent. What we have done in this Budget is because we are going to go through 
<br/>this Emoluments Committee which is the right thing to do, this motion really is for us as Members 
<br/>of Parliament, Ministers and Assistant Ministers, which will also include the determination that can 
<br/>be done on it in future that we are appointing this Parliamentary Emoluments Committee.  But that 
<br/>does not mean that the Parliamentary Emoluments Committee itself will make an assessment because 
<br/>the principle is that, we cannot determine our own salaries and allowances ourselves.  So, we need 
<br/>some experts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am hoping that the Parliamentary Emoluments Committee will appoint because they will do 
<br/>the  Terms  of  Reference,  appoint  an  independent  group  of  experts,  Sir,  to  come  up  with  all  the 
<br/>considerations that Members of Parliament, we have increased the Parliamentary budget, political 
<br/>parties will get more money now. We understood when we sat in the Opposition how difficult it was.  
<br/>I know all the honourable Members on the other side, Assistant Ministers and Ministers have their 
<br/>own vehicles, but Opposition Members also play a very useful role.  A lot of people go to them, a lot 
<br/>of people ask them for donations, a lot of people ask them for lots of things and we want to make 
<br/>sure that every Member of Parliament including Ministers are well equipped in terms of the resources 
<br/>because that is fundamental to a good, functioning democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  why we have included the full salaries that  everyone gets  in  this Budget,  with  the 
<br/>concurrence of the honourable Prime Minister and Cabinet, we will be restoring those salaries back 
<br/>to where it was while the Independent Emoluments Committee looks at the entire salaries, benefits, 
<br/>allowances and pension.  For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now with pension, for young people 
<br/>who  are  coming  into  Parliament,  for  example,  if  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma  does  not  get  into 
<br/>Parliament, he decides to leave Parliament after …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  can  I  just  cut  you  there.    You  are 
<br/>correct in saying all that you have said but that the Opposition is raising is that there is only one 
<br/>legislation that is being reviewed here and it is to do with the Remunerations Act.  Since the mention 
<br/>of pension by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, that is the point that they are 
<br/>raising, why can it not be included?  Can it be included, or will we have to take this back to Cabinet 
<br/>because this is Cabinet’s decision?  If it is not to be included, then we continue as is here.  This is 
<br/>just to do with the Renumerations Act and nothing to do with pension because pensions come under 
<br/>the Pensions Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I have said, Sir, I think we carry on with the Emoluments 
<br/>Committee because the pension as I have said invariably is dependent on the salaries.  It does not 
<br/>stop the Committee from making their recommendations because ultimately, it is Parliament which 
<br/>can make the determination.  On that basis, the changes to the Pensions Act can be made, so it is 
<br/>possible, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Sorry,  Sir,  again,  mine  is  a  clarification  and  this  is  for  purposes  of 
<br/>ensuring  that  we  are  correct.    Of  course,  it  is  an  Emoluments  Committee  that  needs  to  deal  with 
<br/>something that has come to the fore for everyone and there are certain things that need to be raised.  
<br/>It is regarding the actual composition of the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the Emoluments Committee, in the motion it says five people.  The Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Establishment &amp; Membership - Emoluments Committee  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Orders, I am also to understand that this would be a Special Committee where the Committee has the 
<br/>powers of a Standing Committee conferred by the Standing Orders and any other powers specified 
<br/>in the resolution of Parliament and establishes the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question really is, Sir, and it is something that we need to really look at, under Standing 
<br/>Order 114(4), and this is something that we had sought clarification earlier on with respect to the 
<br/>composition of the Committees.  It states and I quote, Sir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Each  party  is,  as  far  as  possible,  entitled  to  be  represented  on  each  standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committee in a way that fairly reflects that party’s representation in Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My reading of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that in these actual Committees, the representation in 
<br/>those Committees is by party, not by coalition.  For us, it is just one, there are three on the other side, 
<br/>so the determination that needs to be made by Parliament or seek an opinion on this, Sir, is that this 
<br/>particular Special Committee and this particular clause has a bearing on all Committees.  It is not 
<br/>something light, it spells it out quite clearly, Sir and I will say this for the general public to hear also.  
<br/>Each party is as far as possible entitled to be represented on each Standing Committee in a way that 
<br/>fairly reflects that party’s representation in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had a discussion on this with the Secretary-General who has not come back to us 
<br/>yet with respect to all the Committees.  In simple terms, the larger the percentage we have, the larger 
<br/>the representation you get on these Committees.  It is not a small thing, it is not something that we 
<br/>can bypass, it is something that we need to correct or find out how you calculate this, Sir.  It is a very 
<br/>important point with respect to the composition.  It is not about the actual Committee itself, it is the 
<br/>composition.  It is a very important point that I think this whole Parliament, all the lawyers and the 
<br/>legal minds in this Parliament need to look at carefully and maybe the Secretary-General would like 
<br/>to get an opinion on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  does  not  only  talk  about  this  particular  Special  Committee.    It  talks  about  all  the  other 
<br/>Committees that we have representation in.  That particular clause would mean, the larger the party, 
<br/>the larger representation in the Committee.  Of course, you have three, you may end up with the same 
<br/>amount if the size of the Committees increase.  I know we have got seven or five, it may have to go 
<br/>to seven; how do we deal with that?  That has to be determined.  Even the current Committees that 
<br/>we sit on, we are sitting on tender books if this is not being interpreted properly, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  give  the  Right  of  Reply,  as  was  raised 
<br/>earlier by the honourable Leader of the Opposition to me regarding the same issue that you have 
<br/>raised honourable Koya, we are still awaiting the provision of that opinion. At the same time, whilst 
<br/>we are waiting for that, we will continue as we are doing now and then when that opinion comes, 
<br/>then we will sit and talk it again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For sure, we will need to be addressing that here in this august Parliament. The issue of party 
<br/>representation or the three parties coming in as one is a representation of the three parties.  As I stated 
<br/>earlier to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I am still waiting for that opinion.  Whilst we are 
<br/>still waiting for that, through the discussion of this motion that we ask the learned Attorney-General 
<br/></span><span>to please re-look at that again as we need a clear definition regarding the issues that have been raised 
<br/></span><span>by the Opposition,  but  for the time being,  we continue as this and let us  vote and decide on this 
<br/>motion.    There  is  nothing  to  stop  us  in  reviewing  the  composition  as  well,  otherwise  everything 
<br/>becomes a standstill.  This will all come to a standstill.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- I apologise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just commenting to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament about the point raised by the honourable Koya.
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think his interpretation of Standing Order 114 is correct but again it is subject to the advice to come 
<br/>from the Office of the Attorney-General.  In the meantime, the </span><span>status quo</span><span> could remain until that 
<br/>opinion comes in and that opinion can resolve the Standing Committee membership from the point 
<br/>in which that advice comes through to your office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will 
<br/>address the issues that have been raised. Firstly, by honourable Koya as was mentioned by honourable 
<br/>Vosarogo, there is an opinion that is due and we are looking forward to the Office of the Solicitor-
<br/>General to provide him opinion as soon as possible, so that there is clarity with this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the composition of the Committee is really by Convention.  There are five 
<br/>Members  in  each  Standing  Committee,  so  we  have  followed  that  number.  Furthermore,  Section 
<br/>114(4)  just  states  that  “each  Party  is  entitled  to  be  represented.”    We  have  consulted  with  our 
<br/>Members within the Coalition Government and party representation, and these had been the Members 
<br/>that had been agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the parties that are not represented, I can confirm that, Mr. Speaker.  It is always done 
<br/>by agreement within the Coalition Government.  As you know the numbers that we have at any time, 
<br/>this is something that we have to work with due to the busyness and availability of our Members. 
<br/>This is the numbers that we have come with and the names.  We are thankful for the continued co-
<br/>operation and good working relationship within the Coalition Government, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point raised by honourable Maharaj about the Pensions Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Yes, it 
<br/>does have some bearing to the sitting of the Emoluments Committee.  However, Sir, as mentioned 
<br/>by honourable Professor Prasad and I needed him to be on his feet because if we are bringing in the 
<br/>Pensions Act and any changes to it, there also financial implications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I needed the honourable Professor Prasad to contribute to the motion and to really confirm 
<br/>that the involvement of the Pensions Act in this regards is really as a natural consequence of what 
<br/>we discussed under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act. It is just in lieu of that.  So, there are no 
<br/>proposals at the moment for changes to the Pensions Act.  Therefore, Sir, we would like to leave the 
<br/>motion as it is, and we will proceed from there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  there  is  something  that  the  Emoluments  Committee  may  wish  to  raise  and  bring  to 
<br/>Parliament about changes to the Pensions Act, we are open to that too.  But at this point, Sir, it is just 
<br/>to do with the Parliamentary Remunerations Act of 2014 and the motion is as is.  I seek the support 
<br/>of Parliament to support this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
