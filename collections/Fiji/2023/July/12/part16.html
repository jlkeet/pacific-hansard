<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we continue with the Batting Order, I will 
<br/>address  Parliament  on  the  issue  raised  by    honourable  Koya  with  respect  to  the  Gazetting  of  the 
<br/>Standing Orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I can confirm that the amended Standing Orders was only gazetted by 
<br/>Star Printery after the official adoption and approval of Parliament.  I can further confirm that the 
<br/>request for official gazettal was sent to Star Printery at 11.04 a.m. today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The copies that were immediately circulated after the approval of the draft gazetted copies 
<br/>have  not  been  officially  gazetted,  that  is,  the  copies  that  you  have  been  receiving.    The  primary 
<br/>purpose of circulating those draft copies was to assist honourable Members immediately, whilst the 
<br/>official gazetted notice was still being undertaken.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, the Secretariat will continue to ensure that you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are served in the most effective and efficient manner. Thank you, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
