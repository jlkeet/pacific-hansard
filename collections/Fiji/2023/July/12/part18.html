<div><span>…when the honourable Leader of the Opposition labelled us on Monday as spending 
<br/>like drunkards in a nightclub, you recited him.  He said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that was true of us now, they were spending like druggies, and might I add, in open 
<br/>daylight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 15 percent is not new to Fiji.  Certainly, it is not new to FijiFirst Party, 
<br/>they introduced it. It was their legacy.  Between 2011 to 2015, 15 percent VAT.  Why? It 
<br/>was necessary to do so at that time to lift our country’s revenue earning.  That was your 
<br/>reasoning.  Everything is linked to everything else.  Ring a bell?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2016 
<br/>was when they reduced 15 percent to 9 percent VAT.  Of course, we all knew the reduction 
<br/>of VAT was driven by politics, it was not driven by economics.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2022, the FijiFirst Government placed a three tier VAT, zero-rated on 21 items, 9 
<br/>percent and 15 percent on other items.  We now will have only two-tier programme, 
<br/>which will only have an overall effect of 3 percent more as opposed to the increased 
<br/>social protection programme and funding that actually puts more money in the pockets 
<br/>of  ordinary  Fijians  than  anything  else,  whose  buying  wish  list  is  only  within  the  22 
<br/>items that are zero-rated.  In addition, the Government is reducing duty on consumable 
<br/>goods that will provide relief on affordability for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the populist FijiFirst Government policies of the past have affected the 
<br/>revenue potential of the Government to get more in order to deliver or improve service 
<br/>delivery to the people all these years, instead of relying in heavy borrowing that we have 
<br/>now  inherited  and  now  will  have  to  pay,  on  their  behalf  and  on  the  weight  of  those 
<br/>irresponsible policies, now on the shoulders of ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  old  adage  that  warns  people  who  point  a finger like the 
<br/>Opposition have been doing for this week.  When you point one finger, remember, four are 
<br/>pointing back at you. Take responsibility for the mess that you had created.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $506 million hole that was identified by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communications in his speech; rebate to movie companies; rebate to oil companies; 
<br/>and  monies  that  could  have  been  better  utilised  in  the  upkeep  of  national 
<br/>infrastructure such as roads, water and electricity grid, health and education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>Excessive borrowing - that is not to suggest that borrowing is not right.  It is what 
<br/>you do with it and how you spend it that is more important.  We all know from the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government record, they score a big failure in their scorecard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>They harp about institutional interference and constitutional violations.  Take a long 
<br/>hard  look  in  the  mirror,  honourable  Members,  you  have  the  worst  record  of 
<br/>interference  since  2006.    Nepotism?    Take  a  long  look  in  the  mirror,  honourable 
<br/>Members.  When you point one finger at us, four are pointing back at you.  How do 
<br/>you explain linen in Suva taken to Nadi for washing and to be returned to Suva for 
<br/>use at the largest hospital of this country?  </span><span>Sa cava? Sa sega na vale ni savasava e 
<br/>Suva? Sa oti na Boom Detergent e Suva me kau i Nadi me lai sava kina?</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Against  all that the  honourable  Opposition Members  have said,  this is the  Budget, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that will set straight the path for economic recovery, bring back prudence in our 
<br/>financial affairs and make Fiji a nation for all to find their feet and also to improve their 
<br/>lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span> </span><span>There is now an increased support for vulnerable and disadvantaged in the new Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Protection Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase in pension funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>We are empowering our community leaders, not just the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community leaders, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all communities by increasing their allowances for them to do their work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iv)</span><span> </span><span>We are returning FNPF to pre-COVID rates by 1</span><span>st</span><span>  January, 2024.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1367 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relatives,  honorable  Members,  your  sons,  daughters,  granddaughters,  grandsons, 
<br/>nephews  and  nieces  are  going  to  be  beneficiaries  to  this  Coalition  Budget. 
<br/>Honourable Rinesh Sharma go and ask those who had loaned and now have their 
<br/>loans  forgiven  as  to  how  they  feel  about  this  aspect  of  the  Government’s 
<br/>Budget?Come back to Parliament in September and report what your findings are. 
<br/>You are included, honourable Ketan Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(vi)</span><span> </span><span>We are paying, Mr. Speaker, what is due to the USP for the sake of our children. Our 
<br/>commitment to pay USP our dues is not tagged to any demand we have on how USP 
<br/>conducts its business. That is for the Council which we dominate, anyway.  Of course, 
<br/>there must be good governance, Mr. Speaker, but such concerns could have been 
<br/>raised  and  achieved  by  consultation  and  not  by  bulldozing  tactics,  such  as  the 
<br/>withdrawal of funding that the FijiFirst Government did.  It is a shameful thing to do! 
<br/>To the students of Fiji at the USP, we are going to ensure that what the Government 
<br/>owes that needs to be paid to USP will be paid for your sake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(vii)</span><span> </span><span>To the people of Vanua Levu, the $200 million 10 year plan to support an integrated, 
<br/>resilient  and  sustainable  tourism  development.  It  would  look,  in  the  beginning, 
<br/>feasibility on  infrastructure to  support the development  programme, sustainability 
<br/>assessment on roads, power grid and connectivity to complement the programme in 
<br/>the latter part of the stages of development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(viii)</span><span> </span><span>To the colleagues of mine from Vanua Levu on both sides of Parliament, this is the 
<br/>answer to our ‘look north cry’ for all these years.  Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, I note 
<br/>the  honourable  Bulitavu;  my  Savusavu  colleague,  the  honourable  Ketan  Lal; 
<br/>honourable  Tuinaceva,  an  adopted  son  of  Savusavu;  and  of  course  the  Leader  of 
<br/>Opposition, have rejected this Budget. I have saved honourable Naivalurua because 
<br/>he has chosen Naitasiri for his home for now.  But I ask the honourable Members, 
<br/>we still have your vote to count and so, please, remember your voters from Vanua 
<br/>Levu. Vote for this Budget and vote for your voters’ interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has been allocated a total budget 
<br/>of  $30.1million</span><span>.  </span><span>This  is  an  increase  of  $6.9  million  from  the  last  financial  year.  So,  in  moving 
<br/>forward, the Ministry will be pragmatic in its approach in delivering, finding new solutions to the 
<br/>existing challenges faced by the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the allocated budget, the Ministry will continue to ensure that we strike the right balance 
<br/>between the fulfilment of our role and function, support and encourage economic activities while 
<br/>ensuring that our environment and resources are sustainably protected and managed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the area of ease of doing business, to sustainably support the development 
<br/>and growth of the agricultural sector and agro- processing, the Ministry will continue to speed up the 
<br/>process of ‘land accessibility’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have reviewed our processes with much focus on land accessibility, Mr. Speaker. This, 
<br/></span><span>of course, you would note is evident in the launch of the State Land Online Application portal, which 
<br/></span><span>is transparent, efficient and accessible to all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lessees can now apply for State land leases without leaving the comfort of their homes, their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>businesses or farms and is readily available through the Ministry’s website.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will also revamp another online portal in the coming months, which is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>1368 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Online Consent Application. State lessees will be able to apply for consent through the MyLeaseInfo 
<br/>portal.  This will enable lessees to track status of their applications online, and at the same time reduce 
<br/>turnaround time in processing applications for consent in all of their land dealings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  door  of  creativity  and  innovativeness  is  what  the  Ministry  has  been  revamping  on  to 
<br/>improve and pursue to ‘go-digital’ in its processes which I must commend. This new Ministry online 
<br/>systems are not outsourced, Mr. Speaker, which would be a costly exercise. This Ministry online 
<br/>portals/systems are developed by our very own innovative ‘in-house’ developers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, therefore, with the budget provision, the Ministry will pursue its commitment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>towards: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the digitization of lease records. 
<br/>efficient streamlining process of survey plan examination and approvals. The Ministry will 
<br/>also  enable  chartered  approved  survey  plans  to  be  viewed  online  via  the  VanuaView 
<br/>platform, and scanned plans will be freely available on the Ministry of Land’s website. 
<br/>continuous  free  access  to  the  Vanua  View  online  and  Fiji’s  Land  Information  System 
<br/>through the provision of $150,000 in this Budget. 
<br/>digitization and upgrading of Fiji’s geological Information with a provision of $120,000</span><span>
<br/></span><span>which  is  aimed  at  updating  the  geological  maps  currently  with  the  Mineral  Resources 
<br/>Department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the area of mining, Mr. Speaker, in order to sustainably develop Fiji’s mineral potential, a 
<br/>provision  of  $1.02  million</span><span> </span><span>has  been  allocated,  which  is  an  increase  of  $128,000  from  last  year’s 
<br/>budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this provision is to fund mining-related policies, provide validated information 
<br/>for our mining investors, monitoring of mining activities and sustainably facilitating the exploration 
<br/>and development of the mineral and petroleum resources of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Mining Division, Mr. Speaker, currently monitors seven</span><span> </span><span>Mining Leases, 35</span><span> </span><span>Exploration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Licences and 38</span><span> </span><span>Quarries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in order to ensure sustainable extraction of sand and gravel and other stones 
<br/>from rivers, an allocation of $62,000</span><span> </span><span>has now been given for the baseline survey of Potential River 
<br/>Aggregate Sites. This item was asked many times during the FijiFirst Government in the past but 
<br/></span><span>was turned down.  With this budget, we will be able to get this baseline survey organised so we can 
<br/></span><span>track usage and stock against the baseline environmental concerns for river back retention across the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  Government’s  commitment,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  providing  access  to  clean  water  as  a 
<br/>fundamental  right  of  every  Fijian,  a  total  of  $3.5  million</span><span> </span><span>has  been  allocated  for  Groundwater 
<br/>Assessment and Development for Large and Smaller Islands.  This represents of almost an addition 
<br/>of $1 million from the previous budget, and this will enable the Ministry to do more for the red zone 
<br/>areas of our island home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is to be noted, Mr. Speaker, that there are some communities who still depend on rainwater 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>harvesting system and hand-dug wells which gets worse during the drought. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Mineral Exploration and Geological Mapping, Mr. Speaker, in this year’s Budget, 
<br/>there is provision for the purchase of a vessel for mineral exploration and geological mapping within 
<br/>Fiji waters, including coastal assessment and surveys for vulnerable communities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when it comes to revenue collection, I am happy to report that the Ministry up 
<br/>to this month has collected a revenue of $21.2 million, which is an increase of $2.3 million for the 
<br/>same period last year with the provision of all the services provided by the Ministry, we will continue 
<br/>in our effort in the collection of revenue and arrears through processes that are mandated by law. 
<br/>Effective from  1</span><span>st</span><span> August,  2023, VAT will increase from 9 percent to  15percent, so we take this 
<br/>opportunity in this national address to encourage those who still owe leases to pay before or on 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>July, 2023. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to assist in the diversification of the economy and income generation for rural 
<br/>Fijians  and  commercial  agricultural  investments,  we  will  continue  to  focus  on  maintaining  as 
<br/>muchgood agricultural land as possible. There is also an allocation in that respect of $123,799</span><span> </span><span>for the 
<br/>Land Use Master Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disaster Management and Resilience, Mr. Speaker, we have an allocation of $12,000 that 
<br/>would allow us, the Government of Fiji, to co-share with satellite lease provider, INTELSAT (IS18), 
<br/>based in Washington to monitor seismic activities and its operations so that we can update our NDMO 
<br/>Operations here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the allocation of $80,000</span><span> </span><span>will also fund this initiative as the expert of knowledge 
<br/>and skillset which has significantly assisted or is of assistance to areas such as Nabavatu Village in 
<br/>Macuata landslip which resulted in cracks on the ground and houses and affects livelihood of those 
<br/>in that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry will also continue its work in monitoring the sustainable use of our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>natural resources through: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>foreshore development activities;  
<br/>tracking down of illegal land subdivisions; 
<br/>monitoring sand and gravel extraction; 
<br/>groundwater extraction rates and use; 
<br/>illegal land dealings and form of land use; and 
<br/>exploration, quarrying and mining operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, before I resume my seat, let us look at some ‘real cooked up numbers’ of the 
<br/>past.  Honourable Maharaj had talked about that in his speech today.  I mean, Mr. Speaker, the real 
<br/>cooked up numbers from 2015-2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  summary,  Mr.  Speaker,  from  2015-2022-2023  Budget.  The  revised  Budget  was 
<br/>$34,662,841,621.41, over $34 billion.  That was budgeted, revised by the FijiFirst Government from 
<br/>2015-2022-2023.  How much did they spend which was the actual? $29,823,378,206.67.  What was 
<br/>the variance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, $4,839,463,414.74.  So, to the people of Fiji, from 2015-2022-2023 Budget, 
<br/>hear it in this Parliament today, you got short-changed by the FijiFirst Government by a whopping 
<br/>$4,839,463,414.74 by your own Estimates. The honourable Usamate wanted a budget for the people 
<br/></span><span>of Fiji, a real budget from this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well,  they  fell  short.    They  fell  short,  Mr.  Speaker,  big  time,  from  2015-2022-2023  by  a 
<br/>whopping close to $5 billion of what they budgeted for. They enticed the people of Fiji that they will 
<br/>spend and yet they did not come up to the mark because their revenue collection was up in the sky 
<br/></span><span>and speculative. They had pulled wool over our eyes for all these years about what they wanted to 
<br/></span><span>do, Mr. Speaker, and at the same breath, short-changed the people of Fiji by close to $5 billion in

<div><span>their Budget from 2015 to2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W. VOSAROGO.- They are trying to ask us how we are going to come up with $680 
<br/>million. People of Fiji are supposed to be asking you, how you budgeted for your budget over these 
<br/>years and failed to deliver on $5 million of what you budgeted for?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget  that was presented by the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister after a very long time, Mr. Speaker, in a timely manner in this Parliament on 
<br/>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023. Thank you, very much, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  upon  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, to 
<br/>give  his  Right  of  Reply.    Just  before  he  takes  the  floor,  I  would  like  to  remind  you,  honourable 
<br/>Members, that he will not be limited in his time of Right of Reply as this was approved in the Business 
<br/>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to especially and once again thank 
<br/>you for your steady hand in guiding us all on the acceptable standards of parliamentary decorum and 
<br/>dignity.    Yours,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  not  an  easy  task  as  you  preside  over  hours  of  deliberations  and 
<br/>provide wise counsel in the process to keep us on the straight and narrow.  But, Mr. Speaker, we can 
<br/>all agree, however, we agree or disagree with each other, your calm hands in on the gavel and we 
<br/>appreciate that and we are grateful for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying there are two Hindi sayings that I will use to describe the 
<br/>Budget  contribution  from  the  Opposition  but  before  that,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister.  I  know  honourable  Naivalurua  yesterday  asked  the  question,  is  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister happy with the Budget?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me tell him, the honourable Prime Minister did not appoint me to, please, him or to make 
<br/>him happy.  The honourable Prime Minister appointed me and his Government to provide economic 
<br/>prosperity, give freedom and stability to this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last six months, Mr. Speaker, he has shown the country and the people of this country 
<br/>that he is not only a compassionate but a gracious Leader and one who is determined to provide that 
<br/>steady leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the more I listen to the debate, and I want to thank all honourable Members for 
<br/>their contribution.  I especially want to thank my colleagues on this side, the honourable Ministers 
<br/>and Assistant Ministers, because what they have done, Mr. Speaker, they have not only made my 
<br/>task easy, but they have also in their own wisdom, understanding, wrote their speeches, studied the 
<br/>Budget, and in the process, have made excellent contribution and debunked most of what came from 
<br/>the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know there are a number of things that the Opposition was expecting from 
<br/></span><span>the Budget because it came out very clearly as I had predicted, because it comes out of what they 
<br/>were saying before the Election and what they said after they lost the Election, and what they have 
<br/>been  saying  for  the  last  six  months.  So,  they  were  saying  during  the  Election  campaign,  “Oh!  If 
<br/>Sitiveni Rabuka and Biman Prasad and SODELPA if they come into Government,  they will take 
<br/>away your social welfare. They will take away Free School, they will bring a scholarship that will 
<br/>discriminate you. They will ruin the economy.” In fact, when the negotiations were going on, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1371 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, to form the government, some of them were calling people and saying, “Sitiveni Rabuka 
<br/>will ruin the economy.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last six months, they went around the country, we know and, we have 
<br/>seen  this.    So,  their  expectation  of  this  Budget  was  that  suddenly,  Biman  Prasad  as  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance is going to come to Parliament and announce that we are cutting social welfare, that we are 
<br/>taking away tuition fees for students, that there will be a very hard budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  when  the  Budget  was  delivered,  when  I  was  delivering  my  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  I 
<br/>actually looked at my colleagues on the other side. When I began, they were pretty straight, so by the 
<br/>time I finished they were disappointed.  There is a good Hindi saying, it says, “</span><span>khisyan billi khamba 
<br/>noche</span><span>”.  When metaphorically translated, it means, embarrassed or a shamed person to bend his or 
<br/>her feeling by quarrelling, and that is what they have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All they have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last two days is is to quarrel about what they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did and what they did in the last 10 years to 15 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The other Hindi saying that is very apt to describe what they 
<br/>have  been  saying  in  their  Budget  contribution  goes  like  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  “</span><span>ulta  chor  kotwal  ke 
<br/>daante</span><span>”,  Figuratively, it is like the thieves telling the guards, “Oh! Do not do this.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which inherited the mess, the looters, and we are still 
<br/>finding everyday Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica said, I just 
<br/>found out last week, another $16 million… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … - Tuna Stabilization Fund.  There is a claim from MWH 
<br/>and he, in his contribution, as Minister for Infrastructure did not say a word about FRA.  He presided 
<br/>over the worst management of infrastructure after spending $3.1 billion.  Look at the state of the 
<br/>roads and bridges today!  He did not talk about that deliberately, he was dancing all over the place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But he did not talk about FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Like Michael Jackson… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to put my colleagues at ease 
<br/></span><span>because if I did the microwave that they are talking about, I will talk for about three hours in my right 
<br/></span><span>of reply.  But I do not intend to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to say this, and I know they do not like it because they still have not got 
<br/>into those chairs and relax themselves that they are now actually in the Opposition.  So, what we 
<br/>heard over the last two or three days is, “FijiFirst did this, FijiFirst did that, this is what you inherited”, 
<br/>that is all they could say, Mr. Speaker, because they were totally taken aback at the way in which we

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have come out and crafted this Budget. They are also worried that this Budget had overwhelming 
<br/>support so far, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Premila Kumar said, “Why is Consumer Council supporting the Budget?”  It is 
<br/>an organisation.  The Fiji Council of Social Services supported the Budget, the business community, 
<br/>the  Employers  Federation,  the  international  donors  and  partners,  they  all  supported  the  Budget 
<br/>because they honestly know that this is a Budget which is not only fiscally prudent, and my colleague, 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources,  just  now  debunked  all  that  they  were 
<br/>saying about debt.  One of the things that they kept saying was, “Oh, debt went because of COVID-
<br/>19” or “Oh, we looked after our people, that is why we had to borrow”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the 2018 Election, they actually produced a fake Budget.  It was 
<br/>a fake Budget and I remember being in Parliament at that time on the Opposition side, where they 
<br/>presented a budget where they cooked the numbers, and honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources is absolutely right.  They tried to show to the people before the Election that this was the 
<br/>expenditure, but there was a whopping $1 billion hole.  They produced a budget, they forecasted the 
<br/>revenue, but the money was never there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after having done all that, the result was so close that when we challenged 
<br/>the result, they hid in Level 9 for two days and we were looking for them.  that, Mr. Speaker, created 
<br/>so much uncertainty and instability and created a situation where people, the investors, were really 
<br/>worried.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  happened  in  2019  before  COVID-19  hit  us,  Mr.  Speaker?    Our  economy  actually 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contracted by negative 1.9 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- COVID-19 saved us! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, COVID-19 saved them a little bit… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…but could not save them fully, that is, why they are sitting on the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by 2019, the economy was grinding to a halt, there was  negative growth, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and when COVID-19 hit us, we went deeper into the hole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They only talked about borrowing.  Yes, we had concessional financing -World Bank, ADB, 
<br/>they looked at many other countries, but was defining for Fiji was this.  We had the fourth highest 
<br/>contraction in our economy in the world, and the reason was, what happened in 2018 and 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we got into 2022, of course, we were recovering from a 17 percent contraction, and 
<br/></span><span>they talked about the economic growth.  Not one of them acknowledged the fact that when COVID-
<br/>19 hit us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all our international partners and donors knew that the Government had 
<br/>nothing in its coffers.  So, we had Australia, New Zealand, the World Bank, ADB, we had all kinds 
<br/>of support not only in terms of direct budget support, but also medical consumables, vaccines, those 
<br/>were all provided to Fiji in a way that was unprecedented.  So, none of them acknowledged that.  
<br/>They were all in Government, but not one of them acknowledged the fact that Australia and New

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Zealand came to our rescue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were taking credit.  They went into the Election in 2022, 
<br/>taking credit that they looked after the people.  But our people, Mr. Speaker, to a large extent, were 
<br/>looked after by international partners, donors and lenders who had provided concessional loans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I sat in the Opposition with you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for eight years, and I have never had this 
<br/>kind of convoluted, confused and contradictory contribution from the Opposition.  So, let me just 
<br/>explain the contradictions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On one hand they all seem to have said, “Oh, this is the biggest expenditure budget, you have 
<br/>to borrow more.  You are spending more.”  Then, on the other side, they are saying, “No, no, you are 
<br/>not giving enough, our people are going to suffer.  This is not the budget for the poor, this is the 
<br/>budget  for  the  rich.”    Then  they  are  saying,  “Oh,  why  are  you  increasing  Company  Tax  to  25 
<br/>percent?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what they want.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What sort of economic logic?  I mean, you have to be logical.  If you say, you are raising 
<br/>Company Tax, and then you are saying  you  are  not  giving enough,  I do  not  know what  they  are 
<br/>talking about.  It is very hard to be able to, sort of, respond, and that is why I am going to keep it 
<br/>short because a lot of things they said is not worth responding, because the people of this country 
<br/>understand and that is why they are so worried.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They seem to be carrying on.  I know some of the speeches are coming from the man whose 
<br/>reasons no one has explained, who managed to kick himself out of Parliament in January soon after 
<br/>having been elected, but when we offered… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Why do you want to attack someone who is not here?  If you want to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talk about someone, talk about us here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- You have another leader outside, that’s why! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What’s your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Our leader is here, our Party leader is outside.  You want to talk about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>someone, talk about someone here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is bit of a hogwash, because they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not understand.  In fact, I thank honourable Usamate because he has given me some points to  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1374 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>raise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, it is quite embarrassing, Mr. Speaker, and I was very disappointed.  There was one 
<br/>opportunity for the honourable Members on the other side to break loose from the dictatorship that 
<br/>they were clogged in for many years.  Yet, they come into this Parliament, and they do not recognise 
<br/>their leader.  They praised the leaders…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They kept referring to them who are outside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, they are referring to both of them outside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- How many leaders there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker!  Standing  Order  81  -  Response  to 
<br/>misrepresentation. I would like to clarify this, he has been talking about the leader.  We had made 
<br/>reference in our speech, and you may like to look at the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, I have made reference to 
<br/>Frank Bainimarama as the former leader, who did not eat the plane or … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am clarifying, the statement I made, and that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement was made in relation to the leader who was here then, not in relation to this leader.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is confusing!. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You should never be confused, Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA also had 
<br/>two leaders - one was the Party leader and the other one is the leader who is sitting here.  So, you 
<br/>should know better.  That is the clarification I want to give and it is up to us, as a Party, we want to 
<br/>call whoever a leader, we will do it.  But I just want to clarify that my statement was in relation to 
<br/>the former leader, and I want to clarify that for your record.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In this Parliament, honourable Kumar should know that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition is a leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the other point that I want to respond to which has been made by honourable 
<br/>Naupoto  today,  right  from  the  first  session  of  Parliament,  obviously,  they  talked  about  how  the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  is  not  following  the  Constitution,  how  the  constitutional  process  is  being 
<br/>bypassed and, in fact, Mr. Speaker, when we were in Opposition, we were constantly reminded about 
<br/>the Constitution. Their General Secretary is a lawyer, he was the drafter of the Constitution, and he 
<br/>knows  the  Constitution.    Honourable  Koya  know  this.    If,  at  any  time,  anyone,  including  the 
<br/>Opposition, feels that the Constitution is not being followed, take it to the court.  That is what they 
<br/></span><span>should do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they have not filed any case, any breach of Constitution by this Government, 
<br/>but they keep talking about it.  They talk about stability, they talk about creating  confidence, yet, 
<br/>these are the very people who created this.    
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1375 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is absolutely important for us as a government to be able to understand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what the Opposition has been saying and this is an opportunity for us to respond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other syndrome that I think the Opposition reply, kind of, signified, Mr. Speaker, is what 
<br/>I call the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’.  It is a psychological syndrome when people remain captured.  It 
<br/>is  an  old  syndrome  where  you  are  looking  at  prisoner  and  the  captor.  What  I  heard  from  the 
<br/>Opposition over the last two or three days when they talked about the microwave budget, when  they 
<br/>talked about what their former leaders were doing, they do not seem to be getting out of there. There 
<br/>is so much captivity there, they were so afraid. I think a lot of them are still afraid, even the new ones 
<br/>who have joined are afraid, and she was trying to explain the Party’s structure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Party is like a company. It has only two shareholders and both of them are out. 
<br/>There are all kind of employees.  Mr. Speaker, they are all employees of a company in which there 
<br/>are only shareholders because their constitution allows only two people to become the leader. That 
<br/>is why they probably referring him as a leader.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in fact I do not know how their constitution was accepted and how they were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>registered as a political party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Fiji is watching you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the other point that they have been making is that this is a big spending budget.  
<br/>It certainly bigger than what I would have preferred personally, but the spending that we are engaging 
<br/>is  now  all  the  catch-up  spending  that  has  been  necessary  for  years.  If  you  have  listened  to  our 
<br/>honourable  Ministers  on  the  Government  side,  the  constant  theme  that  has  come  through  is  the 
<br/>maintenance of facilities and we know and every Minister on this side knows the pathetic state of our 
<br/>facilities.  So, that is what I mean by the substance, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have just pointed out - I pointed out and the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources pointed out, they were putting out budgets in which there was not enough revenue.  So, 
<br/>they were telling the people that they were going to do this, fixed this and that, but nothing was being 
<br/>done.  Therefore, I want to remind the Opposition also, Mr. Speaker, about the findings of the Fiscal 
<br/>Review  Committee  that  instead  of  spending  $5  on  maintenance  for  every  dollar  of  capital 
<br/>expenditure, the previous Government spent only 20 cents on every dollar of capital expenditure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Government built shiny new things for Ministers to open and give speeches, 
<br/>then after the cameras were gone, it will forget about them whether you talked about Labasa Campus, 
<br/>how Navua was done, whether you talk about the moving of equipment from Ba to Navosa just for 
<br/>the opening, was all for show, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government’s Asset Maintenance Model  has been described as build, deteriorate and 
<br/>rebuild. That is the sort of mismanagement that has to be turned around and that is why we told them 
<br/>that $200 million is allocated towards maintenance and that is expenditure.  A lot of it will be capital 
<br/>work. A lot of jobs will be created. Small contractors would be able to take advantage of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what we are also doing through this Budget is to fix the system. We have had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to step in and fix with millions, simply to ensure that they receive some additional reward for  the 
<br/>work that they do.  Teachers were similarly ignored for many years with no annual appraisals carried 
<br/>out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, they were just pretending. It was a government that was pretending, 
<br/>and we have been left with the mess. So, they talked about a big spending budget, but they have not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>1376 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talked about what we need to do now as a Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are things that went into that microwave that they talk about that will never be back 
<br/>there  again.    So,  they  talked  about  a  microwave  budget,  but  it  was  an  analogy  that  describes 
<br/>themselves because in the microwave, they tried to put instant noodles.  It smelled like noodles but 
<br/>when the people actually went and tried to get out the substance, there was nothing there. That is the 
<br/>microwave budget that they talk about.  So, this is a Budget, that spending the money we need to 
<br/>bring the Government back to do real things and not just pretending.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the people know the situation with the VAT. I think, the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Lands and Mineral Resources covered that very well. The 15 percent VAT is not a new thing. 
<br/>They had 15 percent VAT from 2011 to 2015, and there were only six items that were zero-rated. So, 
<br/>the argument that I had from them today and yesterday as well, that this is going to burden the people. 
<br/>But when they were presiding on 15 percent VAT, they did not worry about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this obsession now of more debt and more spending, Mr. Speaker, is all hogwash. They 
<br/>know that it was the obsession of the FijiFirst Government and their false belief that we can continue 
<br/>to borrow more and live beyond our means that led to our debt problem that we have inherited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am surprised, Mr. Speaker, that the Opposition Members are so brainwashed. They still tend 
<br/>to  believe  that  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  them  increasing  the  debt  from  $2.7  billion  to  a 
<br/>staggering $10 billion, similar to the Stockholm Syndrome.  So, independent reports, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>had a very clear message on the fiscal  direction and  I want  to  repeat  some of those because it is 
<br/>important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we came into Government, we had three independent reports, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>World Bank’s Public Expenditure Report; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>International Monetary Fund’s Report; and 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Independent Fiscal Review Committee Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these Reports clearly pointed out three key facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was headed towards a fiscal disaster, if we did not embark on an immediate path of 
<br/>fiscal consolidation which we have begun with this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A credible and meaningful fiscal consolidation was not possible without addressing the 
<br/>revenue side of the Budget because the ill-thought tax cuts and large tax giveaways by the 
<br/>delusional FijiFirst Government had deprived the nation billions of dollars. 
<br/>This deep routed fiscal problem did not start, as I have said, during COVID-19. In fact, it 
<br/>started  in  2014  when  the  then  Minister  of  Economy  what  I  call  started  with  this 
<br/>experimental economics to increase spending without raising sufficient taxes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I just want to remind the Opposition that their hypocrisy, Mr. Speaker, as I have already 
<br/>said can be aptly described by that </span><span>Hindi</span><span> saying, “</span><span>Ulta chor kotwal ke daante”.  </span><span>This is the hypocrisy 
<br/>that is coming from the other side. Again, I do not want to go into that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst were on higher expenditure than ours. They actually lied, Mr. Speaker, on the other 
<br/>side. If you look at FijiFirst Government’s 2017-2018 Budget, they had a planned expenditure of 
<br/>$4.4 billion and their 2018-2019 Budget had allocated $4.7 billion.  That is much higher than this 
<br/>Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  that  is  not  during  COVID-19.    Sir,  2017-2018  Budget  had  a  planned 
<br/>expenditure  of  $4.4  billion  and  2018-2019  (well  before  COVID-19)  Budget  had  allocated  $4.7 
<br/>billion. So, they were all lying. They said this is the highest expenditure.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1377 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The major problems with those two Budgets was that it was based on an extremely unrealistic 
<br/>and fake revenue target with a revenue gap, the figures do not lie.  So, the Budget hold was $1 billion 
<br/>in expenditure promises because there was no money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what we did when we came into Government, as I have said earlier, we started 
<br/>fixing the leak and that is another analogy here which I want to talk about. When you take over a 
<br/>sinking boat, the best way to save that boat from sinking is to first fix the leak, and we are still finding 
<br/>those leaks, we are still trying to fix those and there would be millions of dollars that would be needed 
<br/>to not only stop the leakage but also compensate what has been leaked out and what this Government 
<br/>will have to pay.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they were, again, confused, honourable Usamate was completely confused.  On 
<br/>one hand he talked about the nominal debt, then he talked about debt to GDP ratio, but he knows that 
<br/>this Budget has actually arrested the key indicator of fiscal prudence and, that is, debt to GDP ratio 
<br/>and it is now on a manageable target, it is on manageable track.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  look  at  the  $4.3  billion  expenditure,  Mr.  Speaker,  let  us  dissect  it  a  little  bit.    The 
<br/>budgeted expenditure of $4.3 billion has to be carefully dissected and we talked about it, so I just 
<br/>wanted to repeat because they do not seem to understand this, or they are deliberately misleading the 
<br/>people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we look at the $4.3 billion expenditure, that includes $346 million in VAT expenditure, Sir, 
<br/>that Government has to pay when we produce goods and services, we also have to pay VAT on all 
<br/>our expenditures. So that is an additional expenditure as a result of our tax policy, pension, salaries, 
<br/>interest payments. So, we had to increase the VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent, and Government’s 
<br/>VAT expenditure, Sir, have also increased from $188 million to $346 million, an increase of $160 
<br/>million.  That, in  a way, explains some of the additional expenditure.  Then we have some of the 
<br/>additional expenditures in terms of paying the debt or the dues, for example, USP Grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me debunk another myth that there is nothing new in this Budget - that was the theme 
<br/>that was coming from the other side.  If they think that forgiving $650 million TELS debt is not new, 
<br/>then I do not know what it is. If they think that lifting the burden on 53,000 students, their families, 
<br/>their guardians is not new, I do not know what it is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is an increase in Social Welfare Budget to over $200 million not new?  Is the increase of 15 
<br/>percent in monthly social welfare allowance and 25 percent increase for those who are above 70 years 
<br/>not new?  Is our concentration on the budget for the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the empowerment 
<br/>of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community not new? So, there are a number of features there, Mr. Speaker, that they 
<br/>cannot see and, obviously, they seem to underestimate what is in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me move on to some of the tax measures because that is where they have been totally 
<br/>confused. On one hand, they are saying, “Why are you increasing the VAT”, and on the other hand 
<br/>they are saying, “Why are you are increasing the company tax?” Then they are saying, “Oh, this is a 
<br/>pro-rich budget.” They talk about company tax and in the same breath, they say this is a pro-rich 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Opposition seems to also claim that increasing taxes will harm economic 
<br/></span><span>recovery and growth.  I do not know where they are coming from? As an Economist, Mr. Speaker, I 
<br/>cannot see what they are saying - that these budgetary measures is going to harm the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, if we do not take these measures now, the impact on the economy would 
<br/>be worse and would have been avoidable under the previous trajectory, irresponsibly, orchestrated 
<br/>by the previous Government.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By maintaining macroeconomic and macro-fiscal sustainability, Mr. Speaker, in this Budget, 
<br/>we are sending a very strong signal to the economic investors.  In fact, the investors are very, very 
<br/>pleased, Mr. Speaker, because when you look at the private sector….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. K.K. Lal interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not know, maybe he is suffering from something, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker.  In my ears, I get distracted.  He appears to be a complete nuisance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the fiscal prudence in the Budget has given more confidence to the private sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so I do not know where they are coming from with respect to saying that there is no confidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They should also note, Mr. Speaker, as I have said in my Budget Address, we want to bring 
<br/>certainty and consistency, and we want no surprises, and the business community wants that. So, for 
<br/>departure  tax  increases,  it  is  gradual.    It  used  to  be  $200  two  years  ago  and  we  have  now  only 
<br/>increased it to $225 from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August and $240 from 1st January, 2024, so still below what it used to 
<br/>be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same for corporate taxes which used to be at 20 percent but now we are just increasing it 
<br/>to 25 percent.  VAT used to be 15 percent with only six zero items, now we have 22 VAT-free items. 
<br/>It is important to note that we are not bringing taxes like ECAL, STT, so this argument that it will 
<br/>hurt the tourism industry, we have had good discussion with the tourism industry, and the tourism 
<br/>industry... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think his  statement needs to  be 
<br/>corrected immediately, he is misleading Parliament because he is saying that only six items were 
<br/>under zero VAT.  In fact, 21 items were zero VAT, check speech.  Your speech says 21, and then 
<br/>you are saying you are adding one more.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think honourable Kumar is overly excited by the arguments.  
<br/>What I had very clearly said, Mr. Speaker, VAT used to 15 percent with only 6 zero-rated items.  
<br/>That was from 2011 and 2016.  She did not hear it properly. Now, we have 22 VAT free items, it is 
<br/>important to note that we are not bringing ECAL and STT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk about water tax issue and the SRT deduction. In fact, 
<br/>I  sent  my  Permanent  Secretary  and  Officials  to  have  a  briefing  for  parliamentary  Members.    Of 
<br/>course, they invited others, but all these things were explained to them, but they still ignored that, so 
<br/>let me just correct that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on the criticism both, inside Parliament and outside Parliament.  
<br/>How has the Government restructured the taxation of bottled water companies? The Opposition has 
<br/>tried, in this Parliament, to say that there is something sinister.  Sir, they come up with this conspiracy 
<br/>theory in all these.  I know the ever present ghost of someone that they rely on has made similar 
<br/></span><span>noises. Their General Secretary, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, made similar noises outside of Parliament, 
<br/></span><span>as  well  as  the  Fiji  Labour  Party  Leader.    They  are  all  suggesting  that  because  the  Government 
<br/>exempted water bottling companies from income tax, the Government is  giving away millions of 
<br/>dollars in lost revenue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us remember that this is from the same Government that they were in 
<br/>that passed a special law to free certain special people from their obligation to pay Capital Gains Tax.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Even though, Mr. Speaker, we have now reversed the special 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>law that they made for special people caused the taxpayers of Fiji $70 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And others rushed through the loophole. That is an example 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of a corrupt law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me go back to the water tax and let me say this clearly for 
<br/>everyone’s  benefit,  inside  and  outside  of  Parliament.  The  restructuring  of  taxes  on  bottled  water 
<br/>companies will cause the Fiji Government nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Listen and learn! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, listen, listen, very important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Listen and learn something 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Instead  it  is  projected  to  produce  more  tax  revenue  in  the 
<br/>coming  financial  year  not  less.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  why  is  this?    People  may  ask  how  we  end  up 
<br/>working  with  the  bottled  water  industry  to  take  more  taxes  from  them  than  before?    Important 
<br/>question. The answer is very simple, and they should listen to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen, honourable Ketan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We were approached by the bottled water industry, not Fiji 
<br/>Water, but the industry as a whole, they asked that the Coalition Government restructure  the taxation 
<br/>of the industry so that foreign owners could claim a tax credit in their home country Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, for the tax they paid in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us remember Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the water resource tax that Fiji charges is also the 
<br/>highest in the world.  In this financial year, we expect to collect more than $80 million from water 
<br/>resource tax alone.  Most of this water resource tax is of course collected from one industry player, 
<br/>Fiji Water which is foreign owned.  The industry proposal was to make the income of the bottled 
<br/>water businesses tax free.  The corporate tax that the Government receives from the water bottlers is 
<br/>almost twenty-times less than the water tax.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- So! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- But even then, we do not want to lose that tax, even though it 
<br/>is twenty-times less and that is why the bottled water industry proposed that we increase the water 
<br/>resource tax to make up for the loss corporate tax.  That is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, the higher rate of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>water resource tax has been increased from 18 cents to 19.5 cents a litre to recover any income tax 
<br/>that has been lost.  As a result of this proposal, Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone wins. The Government 
<br/>collects more revenue, not less. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- The industry participants receive the foreign tax credits where 
<br/>they are available and the industry continues to grow, meaning significantly more water resource tax 
<br/>in the coming years.  We expect this to rise to more than $100 million in the 2024-2025 financial 
<br/>year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You are dealing with a billion dollar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, it is completely therefore false, malicious for people like 
<br/>Mr. Mahendra Pal Chaudhry to claim as he did last week that Fiji will lose hundreds of millions of 
<br/>dollars in tax.  The Government will lose nothing, the Government will in fact collect more tax.  Let 
<br/>us not forget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it was while Mr. Chaudhary was Finance Minister in the Military 
<br/>government back in 2008 that the government tried to block exports of Fiji Water to force Fiji Water 
<br/>to pay more tax. That move was a clumsy, shortsighted… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Sit down!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … piece of attempted blackmail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your Standing Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  relevance.    Last  time  I  spoke  about  the  Vice-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chancellor… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What Standing Order?  Say it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Standing Order 74, Mr. Speaker. Sir.  The last time I spoke about the USP 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vice-Chancellor, the honourable Member raised a Point of Order and he said those who were not 
<br/>present here, they should not be speaking about them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is he saying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- He is referring to the former Prime Minister and former Minister of Finance, 
<br/>Mahendra Pal Chaudhary who is not here to defend himself. So, let us not bring other people who 
<br/>are not present here.  Also speaking about our General-Secretary who is not present, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Please show some respect to our leaders.  Thank you.

<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You in the Labour Party?

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much for your Point of Order, honourable Ketan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is  getting  more confused, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That  is  in 
<br/>relation  to  water  tax  I  am  talking  about  because  I  have  to  respond  to  that.    In  fact,  that  decision 
<br/>damaged Fiji’s reputation for foreign investments in a big way and I think they know that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  one,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  talked  about  quite  forcefully  is  the  social 
<br/>responsibility tax which they kind of spin as a pro-rich policy and how we have restructured it.  What 
<br/>we have done here is to simplify and streamline the overly complicated personal income tax regime 
<br/>and made it slightly fair.  What we done is …

<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects)
