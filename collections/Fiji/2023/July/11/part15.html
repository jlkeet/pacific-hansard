<div><span>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  18/2023),  be  considered  by  Parliament 
<br/>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single siting of Parliament 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Friday, 14th July, 2023, but that 
<br/>ample time be given to debate the Bill after the vote on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 
<br/>2023 and the Consequential Bills with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving 
<br/>this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly the Interpretation Act 1967, sets out 
<br/></span><span>the  principles  and  rules  for  the  interpretation  of  written  laws  and  public  documents  in  Fiji.    The 
<br/></span><span>Interpretation  (Amendment)  Act  2021  or  otherwise  known  as  Act  42/2021  provides  where  any 
<br/>written law authorises or require a person to provide his or her name, the person must provide his or 
<br/>her name as specified on his or her Birth Certificate. And where any written law authorises or request 
<br/>a person to provide any form of identification of himself or herself, the person must provide such 
<br/>form  of  identification  which  accurately  reflects  his  or  her  name  as  specified  on  his  or  her  Birth 
<br/>Certificate.
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1187 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Interpretation (Amendment) Act 2021 was seen to disadvantage people who chose to use 
<br/>their  spouse’s  surname  when  providing  their  name  under  any  written  law.    Therefore,  the 
<br/>Interpretation Bill 2023 seeks to amend the Act to allow a person to use his or her spouses surname 
<br/>when providing their name under any written law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consultations were held at the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry  for  
<br/>Finance and the Office of the Solicitor-General. The following stakeholders were formally invited 
<br/>by  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  for  consultation  -  the  Fiji  Women’s  Crisis  Centre,  the  Fiji 
<br/>Women’s Rights Movement, Fiji Council of Churches, iTaukei Land Trust Board, Fijian Elections 
<br/>Office, Fiji National Provident Fund, Fiji Revenue and Customs Service, Land Transport Authority 
<br/>and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration.  Public consultations were also carried out in 
<br/>Suva, Labasa, Lautoka, Nadi and outer islands including Lomaiviti, Gau, Batiki and Nairai.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution to the motion that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is before Parliament and that is the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  say  that  we  are  against  the  procedure  used  –  Standing  Order  51 
<br/>because there is nothing urgent. This week, Sir, is just for the Appropriation Bill and Consequential 
<br/>Bill and this particular Bill and the last one is not related to the Budget.  Again, I would urge the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General to come through the right procedure under the Standing Orders and 
<br/>that  is  to  go  to  the  Standing  Committees.    And  all  the  consultations  that  he  has  done  is  done  by 
<br/>Government, most of it done in Lomaiviti, Nairai and Gau and all the islands that he said, probably 
<br/>to  his  own  voters.  The  consultation  done  by  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.    One  of  the  core 
<br/>functions of legislature (Parliament) is law making and that is why we have Standing Committees.  
<br/>The Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights deals with Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing too that the honourable Attorney-General is missing, this particular Bill came 
<br/>from  complaints  by  women  who  complained  about  their  voter  cards.    A  Parliament  Standing 
<br/>Committee just received a copy of the 2022 Elections Report from Acting Supervisor of Elections 
<br/>and the Acting Supervisor is yet to present the Report before the Committee.   Last Friday, the COC 
<br/>has just appointed an interim Chairman for the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission 
<br/>with  those Commissioners will present  the combined Report on the Fiji Elections  Report and the 
<br/>Elections  Report  that  will  include  the  findings  that  should  also  see  the  changes  in  some  of  our 
<br/>electoral laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill has come very fast, and I know the honourable Attorney-General is trying to prove 
<br/>a point here, but he can wait  for the right procedure.  This is not the right procedure, honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General.   That is why yesterday I suggested for a change of the Attorney-General because 
<br/>of these shortcuts and these kinds of breaches and legal blunders happening.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  no  right  time  than  now.  This  law  was 
<br/>brought  in  under  Standing  Order  51,  the  women  of  this  country  were  not  consulted.  The  point 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu is raising that it is only an Elections Office issue is deluded because the women 
<br/></span><span>who need to change their IDs now is not just limited to the voter ID card. It is now their passport, 
<br/></span><span>their driver’s licence, bank documents wherever their names are used and the spouse’s name held 
<br/>jointly, they need to change that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  women  are  being  affected  as  we  speak,  and  this  law  needs  to  change  so  that  there  is 
<br/>justice for the women of this country. In fact, honourable Bulitavu might be very shockingly surprised 
<br/>to see the statistics from the Fijian Elections Office, and I have asked for that information about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>1188 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voters who turned up to vote on that day.  They may just be surprised to realise why they lost the 
<br/>elections. I believe it is the women of this country who voted them out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the height of hypocrisy when you say, “do  not ever 
<br/>do this” and then when  you are in a position to make the decision to “not to do it” you do the exact 
<br/>opposite.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You should be ashamed.  That is hypocrisy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Helping the women! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  That  is  hypocrisy,  if  you  are  saying  that  we  should  use  the  due 
<br/>processes of Parliament, as soon as you are in power, you say, “okay when we were on that side, 
<br/>forget all that.  Let us do whatever we want to do.”  We had the flippant type of ludicrous comments 
<br/>made by the honourable Turaga here.  Completely overriding all the things you said for the past eight 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that ground, I totally object to this and I object to the absurd illogical logic that was used 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the honourable Tabuya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just had this garbled confused logic.  
<br/>Yes, we opposed Standing Order 51This was, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know he is frustrated about lots of 
<br/>things…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who?  Who is frustrated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is  using a Hindi  word, he is  saying  </span><span>taulo</span><span> which means 
<br/>weighing. I do not know what he means because if he has been weighing his own position in the last 
<br/>eight years, then there are a lot to say.  The people in this country understand in Hindi what </span><span>taulo</span><span>
<br/>means and this guy has been </span><span>taulo-ing</span><span> all his life</span><span> </span><span>but let me come back to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Point of Order! You sit down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Speaker will tell me, not you.  This is the problem with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am addressing the Speaker, not you.  I take those words as an offence 
<br/>and I want the honourable Member to withdraw.  In the morning he was very quick to talk about 
<br/>respect.  What sort of respect are you talking about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Withdraw. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, send him out.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1189 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who the hell are you to tell me? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I was just responding to what he said in Hindi, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, and that makes sense.  Let us come back to what we are discussing on this Bill, the need for 
<br/>urgency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member for clarification, </span><span>taulo </span><span> is Hindi or </span><span>vaka Viti? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hindi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Naisa is laughing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  said  to  me  </span><span>taulo</span><span>  which  means  I  am 
<br/>weighing.  So, I said, “well you have been weighing all your life.  You could be weighing sugar, 
<br/>weighing fish, weighing </span><span>kava.”  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- But we know what you are weighing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And I know how he is there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are destroying Sangam, fix that first.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, can you please ask him, he is just so irritating.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is my right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This honourable Member is displaying uncouth behaviour in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to the Bill, this is urgent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because it was a bad law to begin 
<br/>with because what the previous government was trying to do, by changing all these laws because 
<br/>they wanted to just restrict and restrict through electoral laws and making it difficult … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … for people to participate in the election process.  That was 
<br/></span><span>a bad law at a bad time and many women are still complaining.  If they want to travel, I know at least 
<br/>one  that  I  met  has  to  travel  to  New  Zealand,  they  had  to  apply  for  visa.    It  was  such  a  big 
<br/>inconvenience that was created unnecessarily because someone just thought, okay this might be a 
<br/>good idea.  That is why this Bill is urgent and we support it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very short and I think I do not have to say 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>1190 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>much say for the fact that this is the same thing that we have just raised on the other two Bills.  But 
<br/>I just wanted to point out and also support my brother here, the honourable Usamate that it is quite 
<br/>astounding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the level of hypocrisy that exists like he rightfully pointed out.  We 
<br/>have had eight years of earbashing going on with respect to Standing Order 51.  As soon as they 
<br/>change their clothes, they are doing exactly the same thing.  We will argue the merits of this particular 
<br/>Bill on another day but the use of it now is what we are actually talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Guess  what,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  level  of  debate  just  on  Standing  Order  51  has  gone  to 
<br/>another level.  The insults are now flying around, and the point is, you know when we tell children 
<br/>in one ear out the other.  All they were doing was saying something but when it suits them now, they 
<br/>have adopted all that.  Just like our Budget, they have taken everything that we did and turned it into 
<br/>what they are actually doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So, please, do not do  that.  That is offensive, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You see what I mean.  I am not jumping around in my chair, you are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I know very well that I properly conducted myself but it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quite distasteful when it comes from our honourable Minister of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You started it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Please, I did not start anything. I just stood quietly listening to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not insulting him, Sir, not by any means. He has had his say, let me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have mine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- If he wants to stand up and interject, I will let him speak because I know 
<br/>you will give me the extra minutes. That is all.  It does not need to get personal. That is his problem, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. He starts getting agitated in his seat.  It is most likely you have ants in your pants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I want to add one short point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to remind the 
<br/>Opposition that this law is just a reversal -  the proposal.  It was brought into place to reverse a court 
<br/>decision on Niko Nawaikula… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, that is right.
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1191 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- …when there was an issue about his surname. So, that was 
<br/>why it was brought into place and that was the normal procedure for the Government then which is 
<br/>now in the Opposition when something goes against them, they will create a law to nullify it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Tuisawau.    I  invite  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General for his Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  endorse  the  comments  raised  by  honourable 
<br/>Tabuya.  I  have  had  a  pleasure  of  travelling  to  the  United  States,  London,  Russia,  Denmark, 
<br/>Washington DC and this is what has been expressed to me - the difficulty of trying.  They refuse to 
<br/>renew their passport on the basis of a bad law. As a responsible Government, we bring it in today 
<br/>and the merits and demerits we will hear them on Friday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion.
