<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,    the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, those joining us through livestreaming and those sitting at the public gallery, 
<br/></span><span>ni bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  announcement  of  2023-2024  Budget  was  received  with  much 
<br/>enthusiasm  and  optimism  by  our  Ministry,  and  I  take  this  time  to  acknowledge  the  mercy  of  the 
<br/>Almighty God, who continues to bless us and guide us as we persevere to serve our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I stand to speak in this august Parliament as the Minister for Education.  It is almost 
<br/>ironic when I had spent eight years standing in this august Parliament to fight for our people and our 
<br/>nation from the Opposition bench.  On my nineth year, my God given season and calling has been 
<br/>bestowed, and if there is a lesson, we can impart from this, it is that perseverance and hard work that 
<br/>will get us to our destinies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must never lose sight of our end goals, and with honesty, sincerity of our heart and mind, 
<br/>we will achieve our purpose in life.  So, once again, I must thank the SODELPA Party and all my 
<br/>campaign team and family and our supporters for their unwavering steadfast faith in me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  extend  my  sincere  gratitude  towards  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister of Finance and staff of the Ministry for Finance, for an overwhelming allocation of $845.5 
<br/>million  towards the education sector.  This  is  an allocation that is  responding to  the needs of the 
<br/>people.  Of this, the following was allocated: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Education - $505.3 million; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Higher Education Institutes - $103 million; 
<br/></span><span>TELS -   $148 million; 
<br/>Back to School - $45 million; 
<br/>DFAT - $30 million; and  
<br/>Ongoing Rehabilitation and Construction of Schools and Public Buildings - $12 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was an increase of $132 million from last year’s allocation.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budgetary allocation is a result of extensive and competitive submissions made by the 
<br/>respective Ministries.  I must, therefore, thank the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Education, 
<br/>led  by  our  Executive  Support  Unit  Team,  for  being  able  to  achieve  such  a  huge  Budget  to  be 
<br/>approved.  However, the challenges that now come with such commitment is to ensure that we build 
<br/>and growth outputs of the Ministry to reflect the targets we have set for the Ministry of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, in the past few years, the education sector in Fiji has had to deal 
<br/>with a lot of challenges.  Right from within the Ministry, amendments made to the staffing structure, 
<br/>saw a lot of crucial positions being removed which affected the direction in which the Ministry was 
<br/>operating. These are some major factors that the Ministry of Education wishes to revisit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry being the largest in the Civil Service sector is  custodian to the future of our 
<br/>children. It is also responsible for looking after the welfare of teachers and support staff.  Ultimately, 
<br/>the overall goal of the Ministry of Education is to uplift the standard of quality education in Fiji to 
<br/>be universally competitive and marketable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The stakeholders of the Education sector are many, and the Ministry of Education has the 
<br/>important role to harness all relevant  resources to be able to satisfy and meet global standards of 
<br/>learning and teaching.  As a result, the Ministry of Education as one of its major important agenda 
<br/>for  2023-2024  Budget,  embarked  on  the  four  days’  workshop  which  involved  all  critical  senior 
<br/>officials of the Ministry of Education where the strategic direction of the Ministry was chartered to 
<br/>achieve its strategic plan which will be used for the next five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education has had to deal with the reality that in the last 14 years, there were 
<br/>minimal planning, mentoring and monitoring of the direction in which the Ministry of Education was 
<br/>to head.  As a result, the last Annual Report produced by the Ministry and presented in Parliament 
<br/>was for the fiscal year 2017 and 2018.  These are challenges that the Ministry of Education is now 
<br/>addressing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  the  onset,  we  must  also  thank  the  Public  Service  Commission  for  allowing  the 
<br/>restoration of three Deputy Secretaries, two of which have now been filled and one to be identified 
<br/>and filled shortly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, given the size of the Ministry, we are also re-establishing: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a Training Department to assist in training and identification of the areas of need for training 
<br/></span><span>staff, something which has been an urgent need in the Ministry where staff will be able to 
<br/></span><span>go through upskilling and in-service training which used to be one of the hallmarks of the 
<br/>Civil Service.   
<br/>Research and Development Department. 
<br/>A strengthened Quality Assurance Department to assist in monitoring and evaluation of the 
<br/>implementation of the programmes.  
<br/>Careers Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you all have witnessed, the Ministry of Education has not wasted a day 
<br/>in meeting with stakeholders and dialoguing, something that has been missing in the recent years.  
<br/>By  doing  so,  we  are  giving  back  the  autonomy  of  decision-making  and  management  to  School 
<br/>Management and Communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A bulk of schools in Fiji are managed by faith-based entities and local communities.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Education is very grateful for their resilience and accommodating over the years, despite 
<br/>many  challenges  they  have  faced.    We  intend  to  improve  on  our  relations  with  these  important 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1197 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders  and  build  on  our  trust  and  dialogue  to  be  able  to  address  many  vital  issues  that  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education needs to address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government is committed to building a strong and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperous nation, and this starts with investing in our most valuable assets - our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2023-2024  budgetary  allocation  for  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  been  set  at  $505.4 
<br/>million.  This does not include the allocations for the Higher Education Institutions and TELS. The 
<br/>good news is that this amount is an increase of $15.5 million from $489.9 million last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased allocation is targeting: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the strengthening of TVET;  
<br/>revision and improvement of academic curriculum; 
<br/>re-establishment of a Careers Section which would guide and provide an important role of 
<br/>career planning and advocacy for students through career expos, et cetera; 
<br/>assist with teaching aids and resources;  
<br/>continue with transport assistance;,  
<br/>oversee the engagement of teachers; and 
<br/>review of outdated policies to become people-friendly, responsive and relevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  allocation  will  also  allow  the  Ministry  of  Education  to  revisit  and  oversee  the  re-
<br/>classification of schools.  For example, the Queen Victoria School and Ratu Kadavulevu School in 
<br/>recent years, have been downgraded from large to medium-based schools on unrealistic criteria. The 
<br/>difference between large and medium schools is salaries and workload of staff.  First, the school rolls 
<br/>were used as a criteria to determine the classification of school, and that changed to the number of 
<br/>teachers a school has.  By reclassifying some of these major boarding schools, teachers had to endure 
<br/>more work without proper compensation because they did not take into account the afterhours work 
<br/>demanded to look after boarders, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Naturally, what we can expect is a lot of frustration and demoralized staff, which the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Education (MOE) will now address and correct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOE is aware that the solution to rural and urban drift lies partly in reclassifying rural, 
<br/>remote and maritime schools to become medium or large schools, for instance.  As part of the changes 
<br/>to be considered, the MOE will discuss with the Teacher Unions that each teacher must be able to 
<br/>get a tour stint in a rural or maritime school during their career term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recent days, the office of the Minister was requested to provide boats for 
<br/>students in Malake Island District School and was also engaged in the commissioning of the solar 
<br/>power to be used in schools in the islands of Beqa and Yanuca.  Such attention to the needs of schools 
<br/>that are often forgotten, is part of the MOE direction for the holistic provision of equitable access to 
<br/>inclusive education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that while our children are at the heart of learning, our 
<br/></span><span>teachers are the ones who are the key instruments in shaping and molding these children.  Equally 
<br/></span><span>important are the roles of the non-teaching staff, who ensure that these teachers are supported in their 
<br/>service delivery in the schools.  It is then vital that the teachers, as well as the non-teaching staff, are 
<br/>given their dues and their welfare is also prioritized. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the extension of retirement age to 60 years and the removal of Civil Service contracts, 
<br/>the MOE is excited to work with teachers and to engage the institutional knowledge they have by the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time they get to these years of service, which is passed on to younger teachers joining the workforce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last eight years, I have, time and again, commented in this august Parliament on the 
<br/>demerits of the OMRS system, where there is an imbalance of consideration given to experience and 
<br/>knowledge.  Qualifications seemed to be the only criteria for career progression or promotion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Budget provided, the MOE will engage in further dialogue and envisages that the 
<br/>Education  Summit  to  be  held  in  August  of  this  year  will  further  establish  the  direction  and  the 
<br/>activities needed by MOE to be able to develop the education sector in Fiji and ensure its viability in 
<br/>the long run. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  the  OMRS  system  is,  hopefully,  going  to  be  on  the  agenda  for  the  Public 
<br/>Service  Commission,  and  the  MOE  will  be  keen  to  make  submissions  to  the  Public  Service 
<br/>Commission  on  this  issue  as  we  are  of  the  view  that  a  more  equitable  and  acceptable,  fair  and 
<br/>inclusive system needs to be adopted to remove bias and discrimination against deserving applicants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOE is determined to provide an environment of work that is conducive and exciting for 
<br/>teachers, to  allow them to  pass  on this modus of teaching  to  students  who can be stimulated and 
<br/>excited in return.  So, the MOE intends to make submission to PSC to review the MYAPA monitoring 
<br/>tool that is currently being adopted and giving teachers a lot of headaches in its implementation.  We 
<br/>will  review  what  is  a  more  suitable  monitoring  system  that  is  people-friendly  and  less  time 
<br/>consuming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unless the MOE adjusts to provide an attractive work environment for our people, we will 
<br/>continue to see the brain-drain and exodus of teachers to overseas schools.  So, this is an urgent area 
<br/>we intend to address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget announcement has covered the re-establishment of the National 
<br/>Education Commission to guide the MOE in its setting of the next 10 years education plan, along 
<br/>with  its  education  partners  and  stakeholders.    This  will  be  important  tools  for  assessment  and 
<br/>monitoring  of  the  effectiveness  of  education  programmes,  et  cetera,  used  throughout  the  Fijians 
<br/>schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An  allocation  of  $20,000  has  been  provided  within  this  new  Budget  year  to  review  the 
<br/>outdated legislations and policies which removed equity and inclusivity and other privileges for those 
<br/>teachers who serve selflessly in the rural, remote and maritime schools.  The review of transfer and 
<br/>rural allowance policies of our teachers that were not fairly remunerated, and the reinstatement of 
<br/>executive positions in primary schools will also be addressed in the plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our recent visit to Levuka, Ovalau, and around Vitilevu, we noted that 
<br/>there was a discrepancy in the application of criteria used to determine which schools are eligible for 
<br/>rural and maritime allowance and which schools are not.  It was sad to note that within an island, 
<br/>teachers were aware that some of their colleagues in other nearby schools were being paid maritime 
<br/>allowances, whilst MOE was telling them they were not entitled.  Such practices reek of negligence 
<br/>must not be tolerated, so the MOE will be reviewing all entitlements for rural and maritime schools 
<br/></span><span>to allow for equity and acknowledgement of the hard work, the dedication and perseverance of our 
<br/></span><span>teachers as they carry out the crucial role of being moulders for our future leaders and citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Subsequently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to announce that almost $5.7 million is being 
<br/>allocated for the Rural and Maritime Location Allowance for approximately 3,355 teachers, as an 
<br/>incentive for teaching in rural and maritime locations. We will, therefore, expect some happy teachers 
<br/>and families, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1199 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will also work to confirm around 1,781 acting appointments for Heads 
<br/>of Departments, Heads of Schools, Assistant Principals, Acting Head Teachers, Head Teachers and 
<br/>Vice Principals in various schools in which teachers acted all these years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I wish to thank all teachers who served faithfully and have 
<br/>either migrated, retired and have passed on without being rightly remunerated.  It boggles the mind 
<br/>how the former Minister for Education and Human Resources Executives of the MOE allowed such 
<br/>cruelty to exist whereby some teachers acted as Head of Departments or Head of Schools for as long 
<br/>as 10 years to 12 years, or more.  Shocking is to say the least and deplorable human resource practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If it is any consolations to all the woes the MOE has had to endure for this financial year, the 
<br/>Ministry has been provided with a sum of $8.9 million for the salary upgrades of our teachers.  A 
<br/>total of 1,295 in-service teachers who have upgraded their qualification to relevant undergraduate 
<br/>degree will be moved to Band F/Step 3 – from $22,000 to over $26,000. So far, the Ministry has 
<br/>processed  the  qualification  upgrade  of  139  teachers.    These  numbers  are  expected  to  increase  as 
<br/>universities hold their graduation later in the year and next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  more  than  $100  million  of  the  $505.4  million  is  to  cater  for  the  Free 
<br/>Education Grant and the Transport Assistance for our ECE, Primary and Secondary students.  The 
<br/>current  policy  for  Transport  Assistance  for  school  students  allows  for  students  whose  parents’ 
<br/>combined income is $16,000 or less the opportunity to utilise the Transport Assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Year 2023, 110,193 students have been assisted with this, and $33.3 million has been 
<br/>allocated  for  this  purpose  for  this  financial  year.  What  we  would  like  to  see  is  that  the  bus  and 
<br/>transport providers, whilst receiving this income from the much-needed services, ensure that their 
<br/>buses or transport is safe and of the highest standards as a part of their duty of care to their passengers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent bus accidents involving students from Delana Primary School and other isolated 
<br/>cases around Fiji, has raised serious concerns for the MOE and shortly, the MOE intends to hold 
<br/>discussions with public transport providers to gauge the kind of services being provided and ensure 
<br/>the MOE gets its money’s worth and student lives are prioritized for safety purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  MOE  is  in  the  process  of  strengthening  its  staffing  in  the  Asset 
<br/>Management Unit Department which will be responsible for all the capital projects of the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOE has commenced with the clearing work towards the reconstruction of the Degei 
<br/>Hostel, which was destroyed by fire five years ago, and I see the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>giving me a thumbs up.  The MOE, through the AMU Department, is also working on the technical 
<br/>scoping of the recently destroyed Sukuna House Hostel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We acknowledge the assistance from our education donor partners, DFAT, who assisted with 
<br/>rehabilitating and constructing schools and public buildings that were damaged by natural disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOE is aware of the current infrastructure status of the 13 Government schools because 
<br/>of the absence of the repair and maintenance timetable that used to exist and which we must bring 
<br/></span><span>back, and we are committed to carry out repairs and maintenance with the allocation of $1.88 million.  
<br/></span><span>This will allow us to improve the status of the 13 Government schools’ infrastructure by conducting 
<br/>the necessary repairs and maintenance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOE plays a crucial role in monitoring and evaluating the operations 
<br/>of the Higher Education Institutes through the Higher Education Commission.  The MOE will be 
<br/>working closely with the Higher Education Institutions to offer courses that meet the labour market 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs where it addresses the areas of skills shortage, as well as the allocation of $103 million that 
<br/>support the operations and development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOE has noted a lack of monitoring between the Higher Education Institutions and the 
<br/>Ministry.  We will address this area of need to ensure that the MOE properly monitors the use of 
<br/>Government grant provided, as well as effectiveness of education programmes that students are being 
<br/>provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent revelation that some Veterinary graduates from the Fiji National University (FNU) 
<br/>studied under TSLS and carried the burden of debt after they had graduated, were deemed not suited 
<br/>to be veterinarians.  Even some counselling programmes from higher education institutions are still 
<br/>in incomplete stage, and this is the problem that the MOE is discovering and is addressing so that 
<br/>students who pay good money and give in their efforts to study such programmes, are not robbed of 
<br/>their right to graduate and be recognised for the efforts they put in accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, one of the most monumental decision by the Government in this 
<br/>Budget is the tuition only Hardship Assistance Scheme for private students, which is a new scheme 
<br/>aimed to assist students enrol in Degree Programmes from second year onwards with the grade point 
<br/>average of 65 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Scheme will cater for 2,600 awards, while 250 awards is for MBBS studies. I trust that 
<br/>students and parents who have been running to my office crying for this assistance will now breathe 
<br/>a  sigh  of  relief  and  we  want  parents,  guardians  and  students  to  know  that  we  are  pragmatic  and 
<br/>recognise  the  gap  that  existed  which  must  be  addressed.  Everyone  deserves  to  be  assisted  and 
<br/>everyone deserves another chance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the budgetary allocation for the MOE is a testament to our 
<br/>commitment to providing quality education for all Fijians. We believe that investing in education is 
<br/>investing in our future, and we are dedicated to empowering our students with the knowledge and 
<br/>skills they need to succeed.  We will continue to work tirelessly to improve the educational landscape 
<br/>in Fiji, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this budget will contribute significantly to the development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of our education system and enhance our nation’s human capital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hereby support the 2023-2024 Budget accordingly and it is now time to deliver.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch break

<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, colleagues,  those present in the  gallery, 
<br/>people viewing on television and other electronic gadgets, ladies and gentlemen; accept my humble 
<br/>greetings, </span><span>ni bula vinaka saka, Jai Siya Ram. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I speak on the Budget, I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and your good self, Sir, for your understanding in regards to the Point 
<br/>of Order raised this morning by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I also thank the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament for her understanding 
<br/>and  amicably  resolving  the  issue  and  not  taking  it  any  further.    And  I  thank  you,  Sir,  for  your 
<br/>indulgence.  May God guide us all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my response to the 2023-2024 National Budget, I have this to say; for a nation to thrive 
<br/>economically,  it  needs  the  confidence  and  good  and  honest  investors  because  only  under  such 
<br/>environment, they will get returns for the investments on terms and conditions beneficial to them, to 
<br/>the Government and people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget is not just allocation of funds to different Ministries, it is about creating a conducive 
<br/>environment for people to invest and provide leadership that guarantees stability, equality, security 
<br/>and equal opportunities for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have a government whose supporters are making indecent gestures, and many are now 
<br/>resorting to making racist and discriminatory comments on almost a daily basis on social media.  I 
<br/>can give many examples of this, but I will not waste my time on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here, we also have people who, instead of condemning the actions of some corrupt people, 
<br/>praise  them.    In  the  last  six  months,  we  have  seen  the  deterioration  in  the  rule  of  law  and 
<br/>constitutionalism - swearing in of two of our Members is deliberately delayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the ugly face of the deep-seeded culture of corruption that remains in 
<br/>Fiji, a culture that prioritises certain personalities over the rule of law, a culture that sees some people 
<br/>as untouchable above the rest of us and even above justice, a culture that lurks beneath the surface of 
<br/>a just society waiting to rewrite the rules in its favour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this frightens people away and that is why many people have left our shores 
<br/>since this Government took office.  There is no denial of this fact.  The honourable Minister for Home 
<br/>Affairs and Immigration can provide statistics to this august Parliament, and I am sure if you compare 
<br/>this figure to the figures of the same period in the past years, this year’s figure will surpass figures 
<br/>of all other years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since a lot of people are going away, our population is decreasing, thus the number of people 
<br/></span><span>buying goods and services is also decreasing.  Increasing  VAT is also not encouraging us to buy 
<br/></span><span>more, leading to less consumer spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will talk about the effects of VAT later but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me inform the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister that under his  leadership, his  Minister of Finance has delivered the largest  deficit 
<br/>Budget outside pandemic.  I have noticed in his Budget speech, the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>Minister comparing his Budget figures with Budget figures of the last financial year and the year 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  were  not  normal  times.    The  economies  of  the  whole  world  were 
<br/>almost stagnant during COVID-19.  A good economist would compare apples with apples.  I am not 
<br/>an economist, but I understand the basics of economy and how it works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Debt Report for the April quarter says that there has been a 2.4 percent 
<br/>increase in borrowings over the January to March quarter of this year, which is a 12.5 percent increase 
<br/>in debt compared to the same period last year.  This means that the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>is borrowing at a faster rate.  The report states that the honourable Minister borrowed $223.2 million 
<br/>in the first three months after taking office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  quite  extraordinary  that  instead  of  reducing  debt,  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance is now increasing it.  He, while in Opposition, had been the most vocal about the 
<br/>debt and we have been having non-stop propaganda from him about the national debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whip</span><span> mantri jab vipaksh mei the toh karz lene ke bilkul khilaf the, lekin is saal ke pahele teen 
<br/>mahino mein, unhone </span><span>$223.2 million</span><span> karz liya hai.  Pichle saal ke is awadhi ke milan mei yeh barah 
<br/>dasham lo paanch- </span><span>12.5 percent</span><span> zyada hai.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am worried about our future now.  What happens if we do not achieve the 
<br/>projected revenue?  Our debt  will further increase.  We are very much dependent  on the tourism 
<br/>industry  but  by  increasing  VAT  and  increasing  Airport  Departure  Tax,  we  are  making  tourism 
<br/>industry less competitive.  Tourists will go elsewhere as Fiji will become unaffordable to the budget 
<br/>traveller.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  policies  reflected  in  the  Budget  provide  no  real  prospects  to  have  real  and  sustained 
<br/>growth to service the debt.  There is very little fiscal space left to cater for any unexpected event, 
<br/>such as a rebuild after a climatic event.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  budget  is  anti-low  income  and  middle-income  families.    It  has  accepted  wasteful 
<br/>operational expenditure and seeks to make it the norm.  It has dampened the prospects for real growth.  
<br/>It will adversely affect the lives of ordinary Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are other reasons why a lot of people are migrating; hence, we are 
<br/>losing a lot of skilled people.  Many of our local development projects are on hold due to this.  Some 
<br/>of our local businesses are trying to hire people from abroad to fill the gaps left by those who have 
<br/>migrated but are finding difficulties in doing so because the authorities here are not providing work 
<br/>permits.  The honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration can throw some light on this 
<br/>also during his Budget speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I have been reliably informed that the honourable Minister of Finance is against recruiting 
<br/>people from Bangladesh.  We already have some people here from Bangladesh, working in different 
<br/>sectors of the economy.  They are hardworking people, and we have no problems with them.  Why 
<br/>are we discriminating against them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during his Budget speech, the honourable Minister of Finance, on numerous 
<br/>times, criticised the initiatives of the FijiFirst Government in rebuilding our economy.  He forgets 
<br/>the fact that FijiFirst has set the very foundation of governance in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as a former employee of the Ministry of Communications, I would like to reply to some 
<br/>of the issues raised by him regarding his Ministry and give examples of how some of our initiatives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1203 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are not maintained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, under our flagship initiative -  digitalFIJI, the full Government digital directory enabled 
<br/>Fijians to e-communicate feedback directly to the Government and track the status of their feedback, 
<br/>while  they  await  a  response,  undertook  comprehensive  assessments,  streamline  the  process  of  a 
<br/>number of agencies, massively expedited the digital registration of a newborn, provide a suite of full 
<br/>online  ROC  services  such  as  companies  and  businesses,  systems,  name  searches,    lodgements, 
<br/>amendments, deregistration and cessation services and the ability to make online payments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the ROC search platform is not working.  Up to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 
<br/>2022, we got the search results back in less than two minutes via email.  It is an automated system.  
<br/>How can businesses in the private sector be run efficiently with this kind of messed up regulatory 
<br/>and record keeping systems?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everything in that office is going backwards and processing has slowed down  – the worst 
<br/>ever workplace in the last 20 years. We cannot even register updates and get the certificates in the 
<br/>seven days that was usually the case up to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2022.  Sir, you can try that and see the 
<br/>result for yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding Walesi, honourable Minister of Finance questioned the allocations made to Walesi 
<br/>in the previous Budgets presented by FijiFirst. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  during  his 
<br/>contribution  yesterday  also  spoken  on  that.    One  other  honourable  Minister  on  his  overseas  trip, 
<br/>criticised and questioned the funding for Walesi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we successfully completed the Digital Switchover Awareness Project for 
<br/>the whole of Viti Levu and another $14.6 million was allocated to Walesi in the last Budget to fund 
<br/>the completion of Digital Switchover Awareness Project for the rest of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The continuation of free wireless internet hotspot access over 16 public areas throughout all 
<br/>towns and cities, as well as cover operational expenses to support universal access to information 
<br/>through digital, television and radio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we have over 200,000 households with Walesi Set Top Boxes throughout Fiji which 
<br/>have connected through Walesi’s 25 transmission sites across Fiji and over 700,000 subscribers to 
<br/>the  Walesi  App.    Sir,  700,000  people  watch  Walesi  on  their  phones  now.    In  times  of  disaster, 
<br/>celebration and any time the nation needs notification, you will be connected to the same national 
<br/>network of news, no matter where in Fiji you reside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Walesi also provides free installations for villages and communities halls to 
<br/>enable access to information for the disadvantaged and marginalised communities. Places that have 
<br/>never  had  access  to  live  news,  live  sports  and  other  entertainment  and,  indeed,  access  to 
<br/>Parliamentary proceedings.  This is where the money was spent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not  only  that,  during  COVID-19,  the  FijiFirst  Government  moved  quickly  to  soften  the 
<br/></span><span>negative impact on the education of Fijian children from staying home.  The Government negotiated 
<br/></span><span>with the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation and Walesi to implement a new educational channel. Fijian 
<br/>students from Kindergarten to Year 13 were able to access educational programmes through a new 
<br/>free-to-air Educational Channel on Walesi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government’s goal of keeping Fiji up to date with global technology ensured that we had 
<br/>the infrastructure and technological  capacity to  continue teaching  our children during COVID-19 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when schools were closed.  Students were able to access the Channel at any time through Walesi and 
<br/>the then Government urged parents to also be involved and keep our future leaders educated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  further  ensure  that  our  students  were  engaged  in  their  studies  during  this  period,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education also prepared supplementary resource materials that were accessible online.  
<br/>The  syllabus  was  carefully  prepared  by  the  Curriculum  Advisory  Services  Department  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education with the circumstances in mind and covered all critical information to keep 
<br/>Fijians  up  to  date  from  the  comfort  of  their  own  homes.    So,  you  can  see  how  useful  Walesi  is.  
<br/>Thanks to the FijiFirst Government but time and again, the Coalition Government Members keep 
<br/>criticising Walesi for reasons best known to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about the high borrowing by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/>Sir, we borrowed prudently. We would have seen riots in the streets and that anger would have been 
<br/>justified  because  people  would  have  had  no  food  to  eat.  Rising  prices,  plus  jobless  people,  plus 
<br/>shattered businesses would have added to the worst socio-economic unrest in history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 10 even 20 years from now, we still would find ourselves recovering.  We 
<br/>borrowed to prevent that.  Every Government on earth that could borrow did so for the same reason, 
<br/>and we did not just starve off disaster, we prepared for the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Any objective business owner understands that Government took on that debt so that they, 
<br/>the businesses, would not have to.  If Government had not borrowed money offshore and then injected 
<br/>that liquidity into our domestic financial system, private sector interest rates would have gone through 
<br/>the roof to as high as 10 percent. That means, we prevented debt servicing cost of businesses from 
<br/>skyrocketing upwards of $1 billion, which would have made serious investment virtually impossible 
<br/>for years to come.  We managed that well within the bounds of prudency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have spoken on the VAT increase but as earlier alluded to, I 
<br/>would also like to literally speak on it.  Sir, increasing VAT by 6 percent and increasing social welfare 
<br/>allowances by merely $15 and $25 respectively does not match.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $15 and $25 does not cushion the impact of 6 percent VAT increase on all the items, apart 
<br/>from  the  basic  food  items  and  prescribed  medicine  as  announced  in  the  Budget.    Sir,  prescribed 
<br/>medicine  is  already  given  free  under  the  Free  Medicine  Scheme,  an  initiative  of  the  previous 
<br/>Government.  It does not have to be included here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst Government with zero-rated VAT on 21 basic food items. The increase in the Social 
<br/>Welfare payment is inadequate, considering the high cost of living.  Fijian households will still feel 
<br/>the pinch of paying 15 percent VAT on all other goods and services. From 1st   August, customers 
<br/>can expect their electricity bills to go up, and this will be the same for water bills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water and electricity are basic necessities and from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, people will have pay more for 
<br/>theses necessities.  No more subsidies as FijiFirst used to provide for the low-income earners. With 
<br/>the new rate of VAT to kick in from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, there is little room to bring forward new or deferred 
<br/>spending before the higher rate of VAT becomes effective.  Hence, in the overall scheme of things, 
<br/></span><span>a spike inflation from the increase in VAT will likely slow consumer demand this year, potentially 
<br/></span><span>putting pressure on Government revenue which could mean a higher level of deficit and debt.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance or I should say, the National Federation 
<br/>Party,  has  let  the  workers  of  this  country  down  by  not  increasing  the  minimum  basic  wage  as 
<br/>promised  in  its  Election  campaigns.    Not  only  that,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  has  also 
<br/>announced the price of sugarcane to remain at $85 per tonne, but they promised more during Election 
<br/>campaigns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also do not see any allocation in the Budget for rebuilding Penang Sugar Mill and neither is 
<br/>there any allocation for railway tramlines, as promised during Election campaigns to hoodwink the 
<br/>gullible cane farmers of this country. He unsuccessfully tried to reduce the price of lamb chops but 
<br/>did not realise that come 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, price of lamb chops will go up by 1 percent.  He reduced the 
<br/>duty on import of lamb chops from 5 percent to zero but increased the VAT by 6 percent. So the 
<br/>price will increase by 1 percent.  My advised to the honourable Minister is to stop fooling people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no idea why the fiscal duty on the importation of beef, prawns and 
<br/>ducks  is  reduced.    Sir,  by  reducing  duty  on  these  items,  we  are  not  only  reducing  Government 
<br/>revenue,  but  we  are  also  discouraging  local  cattle  and  poultry  farmers.    In  fact,  we  should  be 
<br/>encouraging local production.  But by reducing duty on these items, we encourage overseas suppliers 
<br/>to enter the local market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that due to the high cost of production here, our local suppliers are unable to 
<br/>compete with the foreign players in the market.  Thus, they close their businesses or reduce it to the 
<br/>subsistence level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing in this Budget to grow the economy.  There 
<br/>is no new capital expenditure and our operational expenses have increased.  Increasing VAT from 9 
<br/>percent to 15 percent has restricted people’s ability to spend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, by spending on capital projects, employment is created, and money is circulated in the 
<br/>economy.    When  people  have  money,  they  spend  it  and  by  doing  so,  they  pay  VAT,  which  is  a 
<br/>revenue for the Government.  This microwave Budget is not creating jobs and that is why the size of 
<br/>our economy will remain the same for the next couple of years.   When we were in Government, we 
<br/>had plans to do four lane roads between Nadi and Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Waste of money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- We also revealed our plans to build Nadi-Suva Highway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Think of the hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- This would have helped people living in the interior of Viti Levu to take their 
<br/>produce to the markets and a lot of other opportunities would have opened up, apart from creating 
<br/>jobs that would have helped our economy to grow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing new or exciting in the Budget that an ordinary person would 
<br/>be  proud  of.    This  is  the  Budget  templated  from  previous  years,  but  with  worse  insertions.    The 
<br/></span><span>Budget does not offer any promise to our citizens, but instead asking them to pay a lot more for the 
<br/></span><span>same goods and services provided in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget fails to adequately address ordinary people’s need for food access, healthcare and 
<br/>workforce.  There is nothing innovative in the Budget to make our economy grow, instead, chose 
<br/>heavier borrowing to cushion the shortfalls.  Government’s reliance on increased taxes and external 
<br/>borrowing is nothing but revenue driven Budget thrusted on the people of Fiji.  This would make an

<div><span>With those words, I do not support the Bill before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good 
<br/>afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  deliver  my  response  to  the  2023-2024  National  Budget.    The 
<br/>“rebuilding  of  the  future  together”  National  Budget  announced  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics two 
<br/>weeks ago, champions freedom, unity, inclusivity and progress as it offers hope and the promise for 
<br/>a better tomorrow to the people of Fiji. I, therefore, commend the honourable Minister, the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary for Finance and their hardworking Team for the thoughtfully considered Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  applaud  the  Coalition  Government  for  its 
<br/>foresight and support to the resource-based sectors.  Fiji is resource rich and the injection of increased 
<br/>budget in these areas is a blessing to bringing back our economy to full recovery.  It is sad to note 
<br/>that this was one of the areas greatly suppressed by the previous Administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As custodians of these natural resources, the mandate of the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry 
<br/>still remains.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned in my Maiden Speech, I hold a portfolio that is 
<br/>most dear to the people of Fiji.  I believe that the Budget has set out an ambition to build on the 
<br/>current efforts and creating something even greater for the next generation.  Whilst we prioritise key 
<br/>activities  in  the  new  financial  year,  we  will  continue  to  collectively  work  to  maintain  a  balance 
<br/>between economic gain and conservation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the interest of time, I will focus my response to the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>and Forestry initiatives that have been newly introduced by the Coalition Government through this 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to speak on the Ministry of Fisheries budget.  The Ministry of 
<br/>Fisheries welcomes the budget of $20.3 million, an increase of around 26 percent from the current 
<br/>fiscal  year.    With  the  global  efforts  of  protecting  an  ocean  and  its  resources,  the  task  at  hand  is, 
<br/>indeed, an overwhelming one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of sustaining, managing and protecting fisheries in Fiji has tripled 
<br/>due to the increasing effect of climate change, as well as the ultimate threat of resources being lost 
<br/>due to overfishing and unsustainable practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the increase in budget, the Ministry of Fisheries has, indeed, been given 
<br/>a boost as this will ensure that its activities and programmes are elevated to assist towards the overall 
<br/>goal of ocean and resource protection for generations to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  achieves  this  through  smart  partnerships  and  close  collaboration  with  all  its 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders across the fisheries supply chain.  This includes subsistence and commercial fisher folks, 
<br/>resource owners, the fishing industry, exporters, academia and partners in development and research, 
<br/>among others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  this  setting,  the  Ministry  has  commenced  the  review  of  the  Fiji  Fisheries  laws  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>account for new and emerging issues which the current laws rendered inadequate, to address the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1207 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>develop fit-for-purpose legislations to support growth in the fisheries sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  review  of  the  laws  is  crucial,  however,  it  was  just  a  talk  fest  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>previous Administration.  Nothing materialised and the review was not implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that within the first six months of our being in Government, the review 
<br/>of  the  law  was  passed  in  Cabinet,  technical  support  by  the  Forum  Fisheries  Agency  sealed  and 
<br/>consultation process is well underway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate change and the depleting of natural resources further underscores the importance of 
<br/>research for our governance.  An allocation of $978,000 will allow the Ministry to direct its efforts 
<br/>of research through smart partnerships with key stakeholders to strengthen the science on the culture 
<br/>of high valued marine species and the collection of sound scientific data and information on species 
<br/>of interest.  We are, indeed, grateful to have partners in development stepping in to assist the Ministry 
<br/>each step of the way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is taking a targetted approach to facilitate the fishing industry 
<br/>issues,  to  ease  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  to  combat  the  issue  of  illegal,  unreported  and 
<br/>unregulated fishing.  A budget of $750,000 has been set aside to implement the e-platform system of 
<br/>licensing and permitting, the Marine Stewardship Certification of offshore fisheries products and the 
<br/>Electronic Monitoring System.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, robust activities to support our coastal communities will be rolled out to 
<br/>bring greater prosperity to all Fijians, including resource owners.  Improvement of livelihoods whilst 
<br/>achieving sustainable blue economy is the key and the Ministry will ensure that it puts all its efforts 
<br/>towards the task at hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1.3 million is allocated towards Coastal Fisheries Development.  Key to 
<br/>this  budget  item  is  the  introduction  of  empowerment  initiatives  for  fish  wardens  to  support  the 
<br/>Ministry with the monitoring of fishing activities within customary fishing right areas.  The Ministry 
<br/>will develop a framework for awarding of fisher-warden allowances to support monitoring, control 
<br/>and surveillance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is here to turn all the ‘talk-fest’ of the previous 
<br/>Administration to action and results.  Sir, $0.9 million has been allocated for the construction of the 
<br/>Koro Service Centre and Ice Plant to ensure that fishers on the Island and nearby islands are able to 
<br/>access the much-needed services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $0.8 million is allocated for the ongoing construction of the Multi-Species 
<br/>Hatchery in Ra and this is expected to assist hundreds of aquaculture farmers across the mainland 
<br/>through  the  introduction  of  new  species  for  farming,  as  well  as  the  continued  supply  of  fish  and 
<br/>shrimp for aquaculture purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will  work  with  communities  and  the  private  sector  through  public  private 
<br/>partnerships to focus on mass production of selected fisheries commodities and diversification into 
<br/></span><span>agriculture and forestry to sustain operations.  An integrated approach is the way to go, and the time 
<br/></span><span>is now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to ensure that quality and excellence are embedded in the 
<br/>processes, service delivery and people that provide services at the 32 Fisheries Service Centres across 
<br/>Fiji.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  and  foremost,  in  realising  this  is  to  ensure  that  the  staff  resides  in  safe  and  healthy 
<br/>standard  quarters.  The  Ministry  welcomes  a  total  of  $200,000  budget  to  upgrade  quarters.    The 
<br/>accounting of this new  budget  items  is  an indication that the Coalition Government  cares for the 
<br/>welfare of Civil Servants who put in all their efforts to produce results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  efforts  to  achieving  a  sustainable  blue  economy  remains 
<br/>steadfast.  It will continue to incorporate climate resilience and adaptation efforts through practical 
<br/>and viable adaption solutions  for the benefit of individual fisheries businesses, the sector and the 
<br/>communities it serves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  deliberate  on  the  forestry  budget.    The  Ministry 
<br/>welcomes the $21.3 million budgetary allocation for Forestry, an increase of 20 percent from the 
<br/>current  year.  The  increased  budgetary  allocation  supports  new  initiatives  that  will  contribute  to 
<br/>rebuilding our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure a solid foundation for forest activities, the Ministry is currently reviewing the Fiji 
<br/>Forest  Act  1992. This  was one of the key policy work that was never completed by the previous 
<br/>Administration.  The Coalition Government is here to complete all these unfinished work and even 
<br/>do better by bringing back key elements that were disintegrated and disjointed previously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  input  from  forest  stakeholders  and  the  public,  the  updated  Act  will  address  present 
<br/>deficiencies in guidelines and processes to align with international commitment, best practices and 
<br/>national developments, particularly in climate change.  Furthermore, the reviewed Act will champion 
<br/>all aspects of sustainable forest management, climate change, forest carbon trade, as well as recent 
<br/>developments in policy and administration of the forest sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  the  review  of  the  Fiji  Forest  Act  1992,  the  Ministry,  in 
<br/>adopting  best  practices,  is  introducing  a  new  Code  of  Practice  for  wood  processing  facilities 
<br/>(sawmills and log yards). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Code will support current forest legislation and policy and will also ensure that the wood 
<br/>resources  of  Fiji  are  processed  to  optimise  economic  and  social  benefits  in  an  environmentally 
<br/>responsible manner, consistent with Fiji’s commitment to sustainable forest management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the recent outbreak of termites in the Western Division, the new code is a timely addition 
<br/>to the forestry law.  Under the Code, the Ministry is committed to enhancing efficiency in overall 
<br/>sawmilling  and  log  yard  operations  to  improve  production  and  quality,  and  to  reduce  waste.    By 
<br/>focussing on timber treatment and quality, we can help to control the infestation of termites and stop 
<br/>the supply of substandard timber into the market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the Office of the Prime Minister for leading the way to eradicate termites through 
<br/>the  Termite  Taskforce  and  hope  that  the  Ministry’s  efforts  will  contribute  towards  a  long-term 
<br/>solution to eradicating termites in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with mahogany reverting to the stewardship of the Ministry of Forestry, this 
<br/></span><span>opens opportunities for trade and value adding in the wood processing space. This is a welcomed 
<br/></span><span>opportunity for the Ministry with a total budget of $0.5 million, to ensure fair and equitable returns 
<br/>to resource owners and their effective inclusion in decision-making.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will closely work with relevant authorities for the development of exit strategies 
<br/>and legislative amendments to foster and address issues that have been affecting the industry and 
<br/>resource owners for far too long.  Ultimately, the review of relevant laws will strengthen the  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1209 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enforcement of sustainable forest management practices and curb illegal forest activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in balancing economic activity with conservation, forest restoration remains 
<br/>a key activity for the Ministry of Forestry.  With $2.5 million allocated to the restoration of degraded 
<br/>forests, the funding will be used to address challenges and to ensure the survival of trees planted. 
<br/>This  will  be  done  through  extensive  monitoring,  undertaking  beat  up,  enhancing  quality  seed 
<br/>collection,  propagation  and  planting  protocols.    The  previous  Administration  only  focussed  on 
<br/>getting numbers on the scoreboard without ever considering the survival rate of what is planted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  aim  is  to  change  the  narrative  and  ensure  budget  is  set  aside  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monitoring and evaluation and for making ineffective processes effective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry welcomes the $2 million allocation for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation 
<br/>and Forest Degradation (REDD+) which will be used to support the implementation phases of the 
<br/>Emission Reduction Programme in 20 districts of 177 villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry welcomes the budget of $200,000, an increase of more than 
<br/>100 percent allocated for forest subsidy on value adding machines to support forest-based companies 
<br/>and resource owners who are often worse off and left behind in the previous Administration. This 
<br/>includes support to landowners who have leased their land for mahogany plantations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  welcomes  the  total  budget  of  $1.4  million  to  support  the 
<br/>subsidising of shipping costs for transporting pine logs to the mainland for further processing and 
<br/>exports.  Changing  the  economic  model  for  maritime  pine  and  introducing  the  commercial 
<br/>development  aspect  after  the  completion  of  the  housing  rehabilitation  programme  was  crucial  to 
<br/>ensure resource owners realise tangible benefits from matured pine trees within their forests. This 
<br/>change  will  benefit  all  those  in  the  supply  chain  and  even  more,  the  economy  from  anticipated 
<br/>increase in forest exports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will ensure working closely with all relevant stakeholders to 
<br/>bring about sustainable results.  Sustainable planting programmes will be introduced to ensure needs 
<br/>of the current and future generations are accounted for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  also  welcomes  the  budget  of  $500,000  to  reconstruct  the 
<br/>Nakavu Bridge which was initially damaged by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016.  The reconstruction of the bridge 
<br/>will  provide  access  to  the  research  lease  and  for  the  completion  of  the  prescription  diameter 
<br/>harvesting  trial  in  Nakavu.  This  will  also  ensure  mitigation  of  associated  risks  to  lives  and 
<br/>environment.    The  Nakavu  landowners  will  welcome  this  development  as  it  will  progress  their 
<br/>interest as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similar  to  Fisheries,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  welcomes  the  budget  of  $350,000  for  the 
<br/>upgrading of offices and quarters. This reaffirms the point I had earlier raised that this Government 
<br/>cares about the safety, health and welfare of civil servants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  allocated  budget  for  2023-2024  fiscal  year,  the  Ministry  will 
<br/></span><span>strengthen its commitment in playing a leadership role in our mission to sustain, manage and protect 
<br/></span><span>Fiji’s fisheries and forestry resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in these difficult times, if I have learned anything, it is the power of love, 
<br/>compassion and hope.  If one person can change the world, it is by being compassionate and giving 
<br/>people love and hope.  If you do these things, the next generation and the generation that follow will 
<br/>live in a far better nation than the one we have today.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry will escalate, widen and 
<br/>increase our drive to improve service delivery, maximise operational or fiscal efficiency.  I would 
<br/>like to end by stating a Chinese verb and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.  Teach a man how to fish and he will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>eat forever.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend and support the 2023-2024 Budget as presented in this august 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>fellow honourable Members of Parliament; to those who are here with us observing from the gallery 
<br/>and those who are watching from home, the offices and workplaces, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  rise  to  give  my  contribution  on  the  2023-2024  Budget  Debate.    Firstly,  allow  me  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congratulate the Fiji Airways as the Skytrax Best Airline in Australia and the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- FijiFirst, FijiFirst! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- We are the best in the region and, again, retaining the Skytrax 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Best Airline Award for the third time in a row.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be a champion in a system where competition 
<br/>is battled at the highest level and amidst the industry giants who have big pockets, is not easy and it 
<br/>is not a fight won overnight.  That award was years in the making.  It  would not have been won 
<br/>without the state-of-the-art fleet. In fact, according to the Chief Executive Officer of the Fiji Airways, 
<br/>it was their biggest selling point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to congratulate the Fiji Drua, both 
<br/>the  men  and  the  women  Teams,  for  their  massive  achievements  in  reaching  the  quarterfinal  and 
<br/>winning the final in what is generally known to be world’s toughest professional rugby competition.  
<br/>Just second year into the Super Competition for the Men’s Team and has already created a historic 
<br/>birth, and for the women’s Team, it was a second final and a win for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  brilliant  young  men  and  women  worked  very  hard.    Huge  sacrifice,  dedication  and 
<br/>commitment from them as an individual and as a team, and that has put them in the rugby world map 
<br/>into the tune ‘the whole of Fiji is proud of you’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is only proper that when you serve great victories and achievements, you 
<br/>give credit where it is due.  I salute the FijiFirst Government and the former Prime Minister, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Voreqe Bainimarama, for not giving up on these two entities during those challenging days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- The pandemic was there, few natural disasters went past, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, it took strong and visionary leadership to keep things moving during tough times.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were negative remarks that came from 
<br/>some  politicians,  especially  then  Members  of  the  Opposition  camp  saying,  “We  do  not  need  a 
<br/>national  airline”.  There  were those who opposed the Government  calling, not  to  support the Fiji 
<br/>Airways’ loan.  Someone commented that even the formation of the Drua Franchise was a waste of 
<br/>money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order by honourable  Tuinaceva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I think we are starting to slide into non-factual statements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- What’s your Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  I  would  ask  the  Member  to  provide  evidence  on  the 
<br/>assertion that some honourable Members on this side said that we did not need a national carrier.  
<br/>Standing Order 62, Sir.  Let us stick to factual comments, </span><span>kerekere</span><span> (please)</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if anyone is still bitter about Fiji Airways, let 
<br/>me remind them on the words of the honourable Prime Minister during his recent visit to the Fiji 
<br/>Airways Headquarters in Nadi sometimes last week.  He said, and I quote:  “You have transformed 
<br/>our beloved airline into a symbol of excellence and a source of national pride.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>honourable Prime Minister, for the encouraging statement and thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for recognising the work of the previous Government in that regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  moving  on,  I  wish  to  congratulate  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the 
<br/>Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics on his presentation 
<br/>on  the  Budget.    I  also  thank  him  for  making  available  to  this  Parliament  the  various  supplement 
<br/>materials to assist us in our understanding the 2023–2024 Budget.  The honourable Minister and his 
<br/>staff, obviously, have put a lot of hard work in the preparation of the Budget and they deserved to be 
<br/>thanked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister 
<br/>of Finance, I do not necessarily agree with him in all he had mentioned in his Budget Address.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  big  spending  Budget  and  the  largest  in  Fiji’s  history,  both  revenue  and 
<br/>expenditure, and one with the largest deficit outside COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see problems coming.  The Budget has violated simple principles.  One of 
<br/></span><span>them is when a government runs its operation under huge revenue that is supported by a hike in VAT 
<br/></span><span>and taxes, they are actually looking for problems.  In other words, when you have a government that 
<br/>their only solution to improving the economy is to obtain revenue by digging deep from the people’s 
<br/>pocket, then it is telling us that disaster is up our path. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is going to make our grassroots people suffer.  Repercussions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be the increase in social problems, rising crimes, as people struggle to cope with life.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  create  a  high  inflammatory  environment  that  brings  a 
<br/>price pressure point, it will slow down the country’s GDP and take revenue away from Government.  
<br/>The result will be, there will be more debt for Government and that journey, Mr. Speaker, has already 
<br/>started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The breakdown provided in the Budget Supplement pointed to an inevitable debt coming our 
<br/>way.  The increase by 6.5 percent and in the next financial year will be a $10.5 billion.  Then another 
<br/>4.7 percent in the 2024-2025 financial year, which will take the debt to $11 million and a further 4 
<br/>percent in 2025-2026 financial year, pushing the debt to $11.5 billion.  The way things are happening, 
<br/>it will only be a matter of time when Government will realise when they are in a swirl of huge debt.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, nothing is wrong with that, provided that Government can grow the economy and 
<br/>have the capacity to manage debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  see  that  the  very  subject  that  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance 
<br/>normally used as ammunition to attack the FijiFirst Government with is debt and bad spending and 
<br/>this is going to come back and haunt him.  The VAT hike, increase in departure tax and increase in 
<br/>corporate tax will hit the tourism industry badly.  In 2022, our tourism earnings totalled $1,499.3 
<br/>million, the 2023 expectation mentioned by the honourable Minister of Finance is around $2,142.3 
<br/>million which is around 43 percent up. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can confidently say, with these new policies 
<br/>introduced  by  the  Coalition  Government,  I  do  not  believe  that  the  43  percent  target  will  ever  be 
<br/>achieved.  This Budget, Mr. Speaker, is going to kill our tourist industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noted with appreciation the total allocation of $183.7 million given to the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force; the increase is to beef up work on preventing and combating cybercrimes and illegal 
<br/>drugs.  The Police Force definitely needs support to speed up the work of protecting our cyber space. 
<br/>Cybercrime crosses borders, it is extremely harmful and can destroy businesses in many ways and it 
<br/>is a threat to any government because of espionage activities.  A study that was done some four years 
<br/>ago concluded that around 1 percent of global GDP which is close to $600 billion is lost to cybercrime 
<br/>each year.  I believe Fiji is already in this circle and the Government may have already been losing 
<br/>millions of dollars, good revenue through cybercrimes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech I acknowledged the honourable Minister of Health 
<br/>and Medical Services on the work done by his Ministry to address NCDs in Fiji. In my view $350,000 
<br/>given to address NCDs is the most unrealistic, uncompassionate and tokenistic in this Budget.  Sir, 
<br/>80 percent  deaths  every  year alluded to  NCDs costing our economy  approximately $400 million. 
<br/>Someone gets a limb amputated every 8 hours in this country because of NCDs. That means three 
<br/>amputations in a day, 21 amputations in a week and 1,097 amputations in a year; that is frightening.  
<br/>A  survey  conducted  sometime  back  by  WHO  indicated  that  66  percent  of  our  population  is 
<br/>overweight.  To me that means majority of our society are sickly due to NCDs. It can also means that 
<br/>66 percent of our population are not 100 percent productive because of NCDs.  Yet, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, 0.7 percent of the Budget allocation is given to NCDs under Public Health for prevention and 
<br/>control purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about the number one killer in Fiji, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health has a big job to do and needs more funds and support from both sides of Parliament to fight 
<br/></span><span>and battle this big killer that is taking away about 80 percent of our population every year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our roads are not safe. From January to June this year, we have recorded 48 
<br/>deaths compared to 15 the same period last year. That is a 220 percent more deaths on our roads. 
<br/>That is the risk we run, we are 220 percent more likely than last year of losing a limb or not returning 
<br/>home alive.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1213 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are questions to be asked, do we have the confidence as parents in our 
<br/>children’s safety when we send them out in public service vehicles like buses, minivans or carriers?  
<br/>For us adults, do we feel safe using our roads or are we just accepting that we do not have a choice 
<br/>and what will be, will be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this point, I just want to acknowledge the honourable Minister responsible 
<br/>for Transport we were able to at a session this morning talking about this issue.  It was a joy to discuss 
<br/>with him ideas of how we can work together in trying to make our roads safe again.  Beliefs are there, 
<br/>that something needs to be done urgently to get safety back on our roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of the Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji in 
<br/>2018, they have already paid out more than $44.8 million for Accident Compensation under the No-
<br/>fault Compensation Scheme and about $30.3 million of that amount was for motor vehicle accidents 
<br/>only.  That is how bad and unsafe of our roads are. Figures do not lie. I appeal to us as law makers 
<br/>in  this  august  Parliament,  let  us  see  this  life  affecting  issue,  get  the  attention  it  deserves  and  the 
<br/>political will to make our roads safe again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noted that the Land Transport Authority has been given a total of $28.4 million allocation 
<br/>with $23.6 million for Operations, an increase of 10 percent from the 2022-2023 Budget allocation.  
<br/>It is to boost Enforcement Operations and improve services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we want safety on our roads, the key is Road Safety Education. If we look 
<br/>at the number of jaywalking cases on our roads, over speeding, reckless driving, drivers talking on 
<br/>mobiles when driving, those on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> or texting on the wheel, those jumping redlights, the level 
<br/>of music in buses, inconsiderate and non-courteous driving behaviour, et cetera.  It is really a worse 
<br/>situation.  We see these behaviours on our roads everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, LTA must be proactive in their approach towards safety. What we need to 
<br/>see are safe drivers, more matured and responsible in their conduct. It is good to see an increase in 
<br/>Traffic Infringement Notices issued but deaths on our road is on the rise.  The question is, what is 
<br/>going wrong?  Saying that the Land Transport Authority might need to urgently review its road safety 
<br/>strategies including enforcement policies and quickly find ways to control and bring back safety on 
<br/>our roads. With the kind of budget given and the support received, we can see changes coming to our 
<br/>roads in the near future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  nothing  in  this  Budget  to  address  road  congestions  during  peak 
<br/>hours along the Suva to Nausori, Lami to Suva and Nadi to Lautoka corridors.  This is a huge problem 
<br/>out  there,  people  are  frustrated,  irritated  and  are  sick  and  tired  of  this  congestion  problem.    It  is 
<br/>affecting our economy, more pollution to the environment and the social and health effects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on an estimated one hour per vehicle idle time and picking on a sample 
<br/>of  around  30,000  medium-sized  vehicles  that  run  on  motor  spirit  Fiji-wide,  on  a  return  trip  in  a 
<br/>congested situation, it can be estimated that the cost congestion to our economy is around $30 million 
<br/>to $40 million in a year.  These are the kind of money we need to run our Government and should 
<br/>not be thrown away just like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, our maritime people have been isolated in this Budget in terms of 
<br/>shipping  services  subsidy.    I  noted  a  drop  by  $200,000  in  the  allocation,  which  is  a  6.2  percent 
<br/>reduction from what was given in the 2022-2023 Budget.  This means that the people of Kadavu, 
<br/>Lau,  Yasawa  and  Lomaiviti  will  have  to  prepare  themselves  to  face  problems  in  getting  a  more 
<br/>consistent and reliable shipping service through the Franchise Programme this coming year.  This is 
<br/>not good news for the maritime population.  Shipping services for them means to replenish supplies,

<div><span>visiting relatives, shopping, sending produce to markets, getting Government visitations on various 
<br/>programmes  and  many  other  activities.    I  am  from  the  maritime  zone;  the  potential  out  there  is 
<br/>immeasurable.  We can contribute to the economy in millions of dollars, what is needed is a reliable 
<br/>shipping  link  that  could  only  be  provided  through  a  shipping  programme  supported  by  the 
<br/>Government.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, most islands get  trips  once  a month through the subsidy service.  
<br/>With a drop in allocation, some islands may now only see a trip once every two months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The idea to bring back Public Works Department (PWD) just for the reason to look after the 
<br/>rural roads and with a $5 million allocation, to me, is a total waste of money and this is backward 
<br/>thinking and lack of wisdom.  I say that because the Government has already an established system 
<br/>in place to look after the rural and farm roads, which is with the Ministry of Rural and Maritime 
<br/>Development and the Ministry of Agriculture.  The duplication and overlapping of responsibilities is 
<br/>going to cause waste, stir abuse and create coordination problems which can invite corrupt practices.  
<br/>It  would have been a great idea to give a portion of the $5 million to the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services for the NCDs Awareness Programmes and part of that $5 million to the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture to increase support given to farmers to build capacity or coordinate market network 
<br/>so that they can be part of our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the million dollars we are searching for to fix our economy is there with the 
<br/>agriculture.  I note a slight increase for the </span><span>dalo</span><span> farming programme, but nothing much for ginger 
<br/>farmers  and  </span><span>yaqona  </span><span>farming  programmes.    My  recommendation  to  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance to give the Ministry for Agriculture more funding under the extension activity and draw a 
<br/>network framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  </span><span>Lelo!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.-   The FijiFirst Government has already laid the foundation.  You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will never go wrong if you pick where we left off and continued.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I share the same concerns raised by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition  and  my  colleagues  from  this  side  of  Parliament  with  regards  to  the  two  unfilled 
<br/>FijiFirst parliamentary seats.  We have said what we have said, but again, I would like to say that we 
<br/>have  denied  two  seats,  three  months  of  waiting  because  the  Constitutional  Offices  Commission 
<br/>(COC) has not stepped up in its duties as stipulated in our Constitution.  For us, justice has been 
<br/>denied to voters who were supposed to have their representatives here in this august Parliament to be 
<br/>their voice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the 2023-
<br/>2024 Appropriation Bill and like other honourable Members who have spoken before me, offer my 
<br/>congratulations to the honourable Minister of Finance for a well thought out and articulated 2023-
<br/>2024 National Budget.  This is the budget for the future.  It is the budget for the new Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me start by responding to the comments from the Opposition.  Throughout the two days 
<br/>we  have  been  hearing  the  Opposition  bragging  about  their  initiatives  over  the  last  eight  years.    I 
<br/>would like to say to them that there is nothing new in Government, there is nothing new in this world.  
<br/></span><span>We are all in this business together.  You have been there for eight years, you have had your chance 
<br/></span><span>to come up with the initiatives and now it is our turn.  Thank you for your initiatives, and we will see 
<br/>that we continue from where you left off and make sure that the people come first.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister responsible for Agriculture and Waterways, I would like to 
<br/>state that over the last 10 years, the budgets allocated to the Ministry has been on a reducing trend.  
<br/>There has been a lot of hot air but nothing to show for it when it came to the money.  If we want the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agriculture sector to seriously grow the economy in a sustainable manner, then we must be willing to 
<br/>throw in the money to make it happen.  If we choose to give money in drips and drops, then expect 
<br/>drips and drops in the sector’s contribution to the national economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the agriculture sector needs is serious money to boost production and productivity right 
<br/>across the value chain.  The allocation of $95.2 million to the Ministry indicates the significance with 
<br/>which  this  Government  recognises  the  importance  of  agriculture  and  its  role  in  Fiji’s  economic 
<br/>development.  It is a major increase from the $64.1 million budget of the Ministry in the last financial 
<br/>year and is a welcome development that augurs well for the future of agriculture in Fiji as a major 
<br/>player in the economic sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry for Agriculture and Waterways’ budget allocation are directed 
<br/>towards the provision of food and nutritional security to all Fijians, income security and to enhance 
<br/>agricultural growth and expansion to stimulate economic activities. This will in turn bolster sector 
<br/>performance, generate export income, ensure sustainable livelihoods and build community resilience 
<br/>in Fiji’s agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during my tenure as Minister, I will ensure that the private sector is engaged 
<br/>as much as possible in the activities of the Ministry for Agriculture with the view to increase agro-
<br/>processing  and  value  addition  of  commodities  as  a  way  out  of  the  seasonality  of  most  of  our 
<br/>commodities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, let me say, that the Ministry for Agriculture is not the engine of growth in 
<br/>the agriculture. It is the private sector.  So, a fully-fledged agro-processing sector will contribute in 
<br/>a  big  way  to  increase  production,  increase  employment,  increase  economic  activity,  increase  in 
<br/>exports and overall growth in the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me touch on some of the key areas that the Ministry would be focussing 
<br/>on.  At production level, the Ministry has been allocated a budget of $2 million to continue to support 
<br/>farm access roads which are the veins of development at farm level.  Without farm roads, farming in 
<br/>Fiji is back breaking. Even horses give up due to the rough terrain under which our farmers operate.  
<br/>I know that most of us here are farmers ourselves including the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>and they well understand what I am saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Planting becomes a problem when it comes to harvesting. You can talk as much as possible 
<br/>to a farmer about planting thousands of </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers or thousands of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> plants but inside the 
<br/>mind of the farmer, he is thinking, come the day of harvesting who is going to carry all these loads 
<br/>back to where it will be sold. This is the purpose of these farm access roads.  We need farm access 
<br/>roads. We need to improve farm access roads in order for our farmers to have access to their farms 
<br/>and also to the markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farm mechanization, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an area that the Ministry will support to ensure mass 
<br/>production and economic viability. The Ministry has been allocated $400,000 which should be given 
<br/>to farming groups on a one-third or two-thirds basis for the purchase of tractors, excavators and farm 
<br/>implements with the view to ensuring mass production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Machinery  Outsourcing,  the  demand  for  machinery  services  continue  to  increase  over  the 
<br/>years due to the commercialisation of farms in the agriculture sector. However, this allocation has 
<br/>been reduced from $7 million to $1 million this year. We have had discussions with the Ministry for 
<br/>Finance Officials, and we felt that the funds should be reallocated into other programmes within the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture budget partly due to the underutilisation of these funds over the last financial 
<br/>year and hiccups in the Government tender process.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $300,000 is allocated for women in agriculture development. The Ministry 
<br/>recognises the immense contribution made by women in both the subsistence and informal income 
<br/>generating sectors and they will be supported through our farming programmes particularly around 
<br/>vanilla and floriculture production. This assistance will cover capacity building training for women, 
<br/>the improvement of nurseries and the provision of seed planting materials for their farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has embarked on an initiative with investors from Israel. This 
<br/>is  to  address  large scale  production technologies. To-date, we have  around three projects  that we 
<br/>should be finalising over the next two weeks. There are two large scale vegetable production projects 
<br/>that will be based in the Sigatoka Valley and one dairy production facility that will be based in the 
<br/>Central Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  a  number  of  new  programmes.    Procurement  of  small  farm 
<br/>machines, we have been purchasing big machines like tractors, excavators but power tillers and hand 
<br/>rotovators  will  enable  land  preparation  to  support  high  yielding  crops  like  vegetables  and  the 
<br/>programme  will  also  support  the  procurement  of  yaqona  pounding  machines  and  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>  drying 
<br/>equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during my maiden speech, I had to the poor state of the Ministry’s staff 
<br/>living quarters.  I am happy to say that the Ministry has been allocated $1 million to address this 
<br/>very problem, and I thank the honourable Minister of Finance for this allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the subsidy for fertilizer and weedicides, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a $1 million subsidy to support the 
<br/>cost of fertilizer and weedicides has been given. It targets key commodities such as rice, </span><span>dalo</span><span> and ginger 
<br/>and these subsidies are expected to cushion the high cost of inputs and enable farmers to sell their produce 
<br/>at affordable prices to the domestic market. This is seen as a way of boosting production in terms of 
<br/>volume to boost the exports and reduce the imports of fresh agriculture produce into Fiji.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an initiative for a Regional Training Centre to be based out of Dobuilevu 
<br/>Research Station in Rakiraki.  This centre will be used to demonstrate modern technology and for the 
<br/>training of Ministry Extension Officers in Fiji as well as the region on the modern agriculture technology 
<br/>techniques. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  organic  agriculture,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  development  of  organic  agriculture  is  gaining 
<br/>momentum in Fiji and the Pacific, and it has enormous benefits given the concerns on NCDs.  People are 
<br/>now turning to health foods and countries are now turning to foods that are proven to be grown in pristine 
<br/>environments  as  a  way  to  healthy  living.    The  Ministry  has  made  a  serious  commitment  to  develop 
<br/>organic agriculture in Fiji.  Over the next three years, we will convert one of our research stations, that is, 
<br/>Naduruloulou Research Station to solely undertake research and development of organic agriculture in 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Agriculture  Marketing  Authority  (AMA),  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry  continues  to 
<br/>support AMA and there is an increase in their budget by $800,000 with an allocation of $3 million for 
<br/>the improvement of their infrastructure and facilities in order for AMA to meet the expected volume of 
<br/>produce that they are going to purchase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tutu and Navuso are two of our two training institutions where young farmers are being trained 
<br/>and the Ministry continues to provide support for these two institutions for the benefit of the agriculture 
<br/>sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  turn  to  Waterways.  The  maintenance  and  well-being  of  Fiji’s  waterways  remains  the 
<br/>responsibility of the people themselves.  Communities must learn to take good care of the rivers and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>streams  as part of their  livelihood provisions.   Government  has  a duty to safeguard these waterways 
<br/>should communities fail to live up to their responsibilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Watershed Management, $1.2 million has been allocated.  The drainage over flooding problem 
<br/>continues to be an issue in this country and the Ministry has taken steps to reintroduce the Drainage 
<br/>Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is of the view that the reintroduction of the Drainage Board 
<br/>will help immensely in taking the load of from the Waterways Division in terms of the maintenance 
<br/>and  upkeep  of  most  of  the  irrigation  schemes  as  well  as  most  of  the  structures  which  has  been 
<br/>neglected for as long as we can remember, but I would not like to play the blame game.  We will get 
<br/>on with the job, we will fix the flood gates, we will fix the seawalls and we will make sure that the 
<br/>services that we need to provide to the people are given in a timely manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by stating once again my appreciation to the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance for presenting a well thought out and well-planned National Budget and I know 
<br/>that this Budget will go a long way in elevating the living standards of farmers and enable us to build 
<br/>our economy for our future generation.  I extend my full support for the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Assistant Ministers and of course, my colleagues, the honourable Members on this side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you allow me, Sir, if I could just convey my congratulations to the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Fisheries and Forestry, hearing his brief on the ice plant in Koro with a figure of about $900,000.  I 
<br/>am sure after that one, you will move into Nairai for the honourable Attorney-General, and I ask if 
<br/>there is a balance in that budget, would you please consider the northern part of Taveuni?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to respond to the proposed 2023-2024 Budget 
<br/>delivered to the distinguished Members of this Parliament by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/>Prof. Biman Prasad.  This is the first Budget delivered by the Coalition Government since its delivery 
<br/>to  the  august  Parliament,  my  colleagues  and  I  have  been  examining  the  detail  and  have  been  in 
<br/>consultation with the people, seeking their views and forming our considered responses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the extensive work that the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>and his team undertook in developing the Budget papers and presenting them in a timely manner, 
<br/></span><span>vinaka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also acknowledge the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his Budget 
<br/>response yesterday and, at times, humorous but also serious critical deconstruction.  The honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition showed the value of our national debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I guess, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of the day, what really matters is only the figures and 
<br/>numbers that is contained therein.  That composes of the wishes, desires, dreams of the people of Fiji 
<br/>which has been prepared into ideas and plans.  But I believe, at the end of the day what matters most 
<br/></span><span>is how this is translated into actions.  Actions that capture the wishes and the dreams of our people.  
<br/></span><span>Critically more important is whether those actions translate and captures the interest of our people or 
<br/>serves the interest of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, this Coalition Government was given a charter.  Our President, 
<br/>His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, in opening Parliament on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 laid out the 
<br/>charter and I quote:

<div><span>“Your Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion and improve 
<br/>and  strengthen  our  economy  through  sustainable  growth  with  the  ultimate  objective  of 
<br/>improving the lives of all the people of Fiji”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his Budget Address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Professor Prasad reminded us that 
<br/>everything  is  connected  to  everything  else  and  so  it  is  with  his  proposed  Budget.    His  Budget  is 
<br/>connected to the past, the present and the future.  The strong economic foundation of the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  provided to the Coalition Government  allows the honourable Minister of Finance to 
<br/>prepare and present this proposed Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, his proposed Budget attempts to address the issues of the present, and as we 
<br/>have examined the details, there is nothing new in this Budget, nothing innovative other than having 
<br/>the distinction of being the biggest spending Budget Fiji has ever had. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this proposed Budget will assist or stall Fiji’s future development.  A budget 
<br/>cannot  just  look  to  today,  it  must  consider  a  future  timeline  and  develop  and  secure  a  nation’s 
<br/>economic base for the next generation.  When I look at the revenue and corresponding expenditure, 
<br/>I see much that concerns me and my colleagues on this side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  has  attempted  to  set  a  scene  for  his 
<br/>proposed Budget that is a fabrication of the economic realities in my view.  This has served to muddy 
<br/>the waters of his responsibility, which is to continue to steer the economy to recovery after the global 
<br/>setbacks of COVID-19. And continue to ensure the opportunity and wellbeing of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  manner  in  which  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  exempted  the 
<br/>wealthy  from  their  proportional  tax  burden,  favoured  a  well-established  company  with  tax 
<br/>exemptions, increased the tax burden on Fiji’s tourism industry and played a half game with VAT, 
<br/>in  my  view  is  disheartening.    A  fundamental  principle  of  a  just  society  is  that  everyone  should 
<br/>contribute according to their means and yet the social responsibility levy has been removed.  Fiji 
<br/>Water gains a tax-exempt status.  Fiji’s biggest brand, tourism has an increased tax burden, and the 
<br/>poor are considered fortunate because they can buy the 22 items without VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  spends  and  spends  but  lacks  serious  direction  and  bold 
<br/>initiatives. I state this while also acknowledging that there are some highlights in different ministries 
<br/>portfolios that have the potential to make a difference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one such highlight is the changes within the Ministry of Women, Children 
<br/>and Social Protection.  These changes are a positive response to the growing needs of our nation’s 
<br/>vulnerable, children and women.  I am aware that the Ministry has renewed its commitment to work 
<br/>with Civil Service Organisations, faith-based organisations and community stakeholders to ensure 
<br/>better  outcomes  in  the  service  delivery  and  in  the  critical  areas  of  gender  violence.  The  Budget 
<br/>allocation positively reflects some of these changes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another initiative that deserves credit is the new Ministry of Tourism and 
<br/>Civil  Aviation.  Establishing  this  Ministry  allows  an  appropriate  focus  on  Fiji’s  essential  tourism 
<br/></span><span>industry and collaboration with its stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to see the ongoing support for Youth and Sports to showcase 
<br/>our talented sportsmen and women at regional and international events.  The opportunity to build on 
<br/>Fiji’s brand through sports is significant and while the Budget allocation allows for a continuation of 
<br/>what FijiFirst began, I believe much more can and needs to be done to establish a clear and bold Fiji 
<br/>Sports brand.

<div><span>Sir, FijiFirst provided this opportunity and supported the Fiji Drua and Fijiana Drua Teams 
<br/>engagement in the Super Rugby competitions, something that we are all proud of now.  The nation 
<br/>can  be  proud  of  what  FijiFirst  began  in  further  developing  Fiji’s  sports  brand  and  providing 
<br/>exceptional international opportunities for our young sports people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while speaking on the area of our nation’s youth, 
<br/>I  also  expressed  my  surprise  and  disappointment  at  the  lack  of  initiative  in  areas  critical  to  the 
<br/>development of our youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  young  people’s  rising  mental  health  needs  are  a  concern.  I  recently 
<br/>spoke to counsellors overwhelmed with the increased mental health demands in our schools, higher 
<br/>education  institutions  and  communities.  I  see  no  clear,  coordinated  approach  as  I  examined  this 
<br/>Budget.  There is an allocation for Mental Health Awareness in the Ministry of Health and another 
<br/>allocation for Gender Violence Awareness in Education. However, these piecemeal approaches do 
<br/>nothing to address the mental health issues of our young people.  Our young people need support, 
<br/>interventions and care and this Budget, I believe, fails to address this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget is silent on the issue of youth unemployment.  As 
<br/>I  visit  Nanuku  Settlement  in  Vatuwaqa,  I  see  and  talk  with  the  young  people  in  need  of  both 
<br/>opportunity  and  livelihood.    As  Fiji’s  population  becomes  more  urbanised,  there  is  an  increasing 
<br/>population of young people who will not find their future in farming their own land or fishing their 
<br/>own sea.  These young people need a government that can create, innovate and secure pathways to 
<br/>livelihoods in urban centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  has  provided  tax  relief  to  Fiji  Water,  a  well-established  and 
<br/>profitable organisation, while here in Suva, we have a young start-up organisation, Bula Outsourcing, 
<br/>which is taking risks and growing by employing our young people, training them and allowing our 
<br/>young people to find livelihood and a future here.  This Budget has just increased their tax burden.  
<br/>This Budget has favoured a multinational and overlooked what is essential for our economy… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Point  of  Order!    With  due  respect  to  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Naivalurua, all BPO operators, which Bula Outsourcing is one, is tax free.  Let us stick to facts.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Thank you honourable Deputy Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our nation’s largest demographic is below the age of 35 years, yet there are 
<br/>no short to medium term plans that address this group and the real-time issues that support them.  For 
<br/>example, what is the budget or Government’s response to increasing drug use in our society?  What 
<br/>is the response to social media and its impact on our youth?  Where is the conversation around the 
<br/>access and harms of pornography?  What are the responses to our society’s decline in moral values 
<br/>and the evidence of this expressed by our village and community leaders?  Let me press this point 
<br/>further.  What is the Coalition Government’s response to the youth’s employment needs, to our young 
<br/>people’s desire for housing, to start a family and to secure a future?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are just pointing them overseas and saying farewell or do we have the 
<br/>courage to  fund bold initiatives that both build a better Fiji and make Fiji a home of success and 
<br/>security for the next generation?  Or, put it simply, they want to  remain in Fiji and call Fiji their 
<br/>home.  I see nothing in the Budget that addresses the concern of my fellow young Fijians.  We are 
<br/>fortunate to be blessed with a young population, and I ask if this Budget is fulfilling its responsibility 
<br/>to them?  I believe the Budget needs more funding and bold initiatives to help our youth.  Along with

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>funding and bold initiatives, the Coalition Government needs a leadership that can both talk into the 
<br/>issues and lead to the heart of the issues to move past a reheat of old ideas and see what is needed for 
<br/>our future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note in the honourable Minister’s Budget Address the commencement of 
<br/>four new embassies, of which three have received a budget allocation - Washington, Port Moresby 
<br/>and  Kuala  Lumpur  of  $4  million.    Fiji’s  engagement  in  the  region  and  maintaining  our  presence 
<br/>globally is vital for our ability to achieve foreign policy objectives.  Under the FijiFirst government, 
<br/>we worked hard to balance our foreign relationship and secure Fiji’s place and position as a regional 
<br/>and global voice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the recommitment to re-establish the formal representations, we 
<br/>need to ensure we are using our resources wisely and with the confidence of a return on investment.  
<br/>Fiji’s economic recovery has priority over re-establishing three missions in the 2023-2024 Budget 
<br/>and I would urge reconsideration on the timing and priority of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The world of diplomacy and international relationships has alternative models where Fiji can 
<br/>gain representation and engage in meaningful dialogue without establishing full mission status and 
<br/>bearing the associated costs.  These other models deserve to be explored so that funding best supports 
<br/>our economic growth and further builds on our status as a regional hub.  We can afford to be creative 
<br/>in exploring what serves our interests well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the FijiFirst Government, our international engagements widened.  We took leadership 
<br/>in critical roles and organisations that further strengthened our standing and our opportunity.  Fiji has 
<br/>demonstrated that we can engage in dialogue above our size and weight.  A renewed effort needs to 
<br/>be taken to secure these opportunities so that we can influence what is important to us in the areas of 
<br/>climate change, regional security and trade policies.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wonder  if  the  honourable  Members  on  the  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament  understand  just  how  everything  is  connected  to  everything  else.    There  have  been 
<br/>grumbles about the cost of our peacekeeping and so they need to be reminded that the boots of our 
<br/>soldiers on the ground in Lebanon, Sinai, Iraq to name a few, are what we call foreign policy tools.  
<br/>In the same way, the boots of our rugby players as they play and thrill the crowds also serve as an 
<br/>active foreign policy engagement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  note  that  the  budget  allocation  of  $1.2  million  to  Pacific  Island 
<br/>Development Forum (PIDF).  I recommend that the PIDF is overdue for a review to identify how it 
<br/>best serves Fiji and the region.  The budget allocation would be better served in realigning PIDF to 
<br/>achieve a deeper and more meaningful engagement in the region.  If aligned correctly, PIDF has a 
<br/>role to play in building and shaping our region’s aspirations and strengthening Fiji’s role as a regional 
<br/>hub.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commented earlier on the new Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.  
<br/>Part of the responsibility of this new Ministry is the Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme 
<br/>which has been allocated $5 million in Phase I.  While accepting World Bank funding for further 
<br/></span><span>tourism development is one issue, do we have the bold and insightful leadership to take our tourism 
<br/></span><span>experiences  to  the  next  level?    Can  we,  as  leaders,  vision  what  is  possible  in  Vanua  Levu  and 
<br/>Taveuni?  What would a bridge between Vanua Levu and Taveuni do for tourism and agriculture?  
<br/>What would a cable car over Taveuni from Somosomo over to Lavena and one falls down to South 
<br/>Taveuni and the other one falling into Matei add to tourism adventure and experience?  Some may 
<br/>call these ides fanciful, but what does it take for us to see with the new vision and new boldness to 
<br/>secure Fiji’s future.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1221 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has an appeal and beauty and as the honourable Speaker well knows the friendly North is 
<br/>under appreciated in what it can contribute to Fiji’s economy.  While I support the initiative of this 
<br/>new Ministry, at the same time, I am challenging the need for innovation and bold vision leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we love rugby, and our young people love rugby, yet we have neglected to 
<br/>undertake the available opportunities in sports tourism and developing Fiji as a sports hub.  I believe 
<br/>there is work towards that, honourable Minister.  While other countries have oil fields and diamond 
<br/>fields, we have an incredible resource of active, vibrant, young people ready to showcase their talent 
<br/>to the world.   That is our diamond field, that is our oil field.  I suggest at this point, maybe we should 
<br/>consider a rugby academy in the Island of Taveuni and perhaps the manufacturing of rugby balls 
<br/>somewhere in Nardoga and we do something like that that is connected to rugby and sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism is about connecting the world to Fiji, and I encourage the Coalition 
<br/>Government to think wider and become more innovative in the way they think through investing in 
<br/>our future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging to see the increased allocation to the Fiji Police Force.  As a 
<br/>former Police Commissioner, I know the importance of maintaining and improving our local security 
<br/>needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I am encouraged by the budgetary allocation, I am saddened to see 
<br/>increased crimes and how our Police Services responses have deteriorated.  There are needs to be 
<br/>more speed responses to community requests.  Police officers seem to be more concerned, in my 
<br/>view, in paperwork that immediately responding to complaints. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday the owner 
<br/>of a well-known restaurant was assaulted and robbed inside her home compound when she got home 
<br/>with  the day’s takings. The single-mother business  owner has  worked hard to  build her life from 
<br/>selling roti parcel in the streets to establishing a quality restaurant.  What has been the response to 
<br/>her plight. Apparently, the responsible Minister was alleged to have said, “the next time you carry 
<br/>money, let me know.” Was this said because he had lost confidence in his own Department?  More 
<br/>importantly, Mr. Speaker, is this the correct way to address a deteriorating secured situation? There 
<br/>are so many other stories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  are  increasing      reports  that  Police  on  the  highways  are  now  openly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nudging speedsters for lunch money.  I have heard real stories about this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my view FICAC should remain as an independent unit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me emphasize to this august House the importance of good governance 
<br/>in our nation.  It is a responsibility we must uphold as entrusted by the people of Fiji.  We have been 
<br/>mandated to safeguard their interest and ensure a prosperous future for all.  It saddens me to point 
<br/>out the failure of governance by the Coalition Government in ensuring appropriate representation in 
<br/>today’s Parliament by the shortage of our two Members. Their responsibility has lapsed and fallen to 
<br/>political  point-scoring in my  view.  The Coalition Government  has fiddled with  the integrity and 
<br/>timeliness of governance.  The Coalition Government demonstrates that they are not interested in 
<br/>true representations but remain more interested in playing politics of self-interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I return to the words of His Excellency the President in his opening Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Your Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion and further 
<br/>improve  and  strengthen  our  economy  through  sustainable  growth  within  the  ultimate 
<br/>objective of improving the lives of all people of Fiji.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the question that all Fijians are asking.  Does this Budget deliver unity 
<br/>further improve and strengthen our economy, provide sustainable growth and improve the lives of 
<br/>all the people of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  ask  the  question  of  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister, is he happy with this Budget?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Does  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  believe  it  meets  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expectation of His Excellency the President and all the people of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT  MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  believe  this  Budget  meets  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expectation of many of my fellow Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My colleagues have termed it a microwave Budget that I would agree and say that at best it 
<br/>is half-baked.  The Budget lacks creativity, innovation, imagination and boldness to do the right thing 
<br/>in moving Fiji forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fails to support the bold initiatives of our young people and need to make Fiji their future 
<br/>home; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2)</span><span> </span><span>Underfunds the crisis we have with NCDs; 
<br/>3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Leaves our poor an under-privilege in their current plight; 
<br/>4)</span><span> </span><span>Neglects to establish the pathways out of unemployment; 
<br/>5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Ignores the emerging opportunities in agriculture; 
<br/>6)</span><span> </span><span>Overlooks the needs for recovery and excessive spends; and 
<br/>7)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taxes the industries and small businesses that are in recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget fails, in my view, to grow the economy, its revenue assumptions 
<br/>are uncertain. It keeps Fijian guessing at what new tax increases might be around the corner. I close 
<br/>with a challenge to the leadership of the Coalition Government.  If you cannot take the heat in the 
<br/>kitchen, get out. But I say, if you cannot make some heat, get out of the kitchen. This country deserves 
<br/>a Budget and leadership that unites, creates confidence, delivers sovereignty and stands on truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget does not meet our expectation.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me this Budget deserves (honourable Member shows a red card). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Naivalurua for flashing that red card.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea and then when 
<br/></span><span>we resume the honourable Minister for Youth will take the floor.  Parliament is adjourned till 4.30

<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to rise on a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on a Point of Order under Standing 
<br/>Order  60.    It  has  been  a  protocol  in  Parliament  and  has  become  a  tradition  that  when  a  Member 
<br/>presents his maiden speech and makes a contribution to the Budget, normally there is no Point of 
<br/>Order when the Member is on the floor.  This allows fluency and the Member to stay within the time 
<br/>frame of 20 minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Normally, if there is any question, it is directed towards the mover of the motion who will 
<br/>answer to all the queries and in this case, the Minister of Finance.  I just wanted a clarification from 
<br/>you, Sir, if this has moved away from the normal protocol and tradition of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau.  I will take note of what you have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>asked and will be making a statement to that effect once I receive it from the Secretary- General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to 
<br/>make a brief statement in support of the motion before Parliament.  Before I proceed, I would like to 
<br/>take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to the Almighty God for His guidance and blessings 
<br/>throughout my journey.  It is through His grace that we find the strength and wisdom to serve our 
<br/>nation and empower our young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this opportunity to thank honourable Naivalurua for his contribution and hopefully my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribution will shed some light on the issues he has raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also take this opportunity to thank our Special Olympic team that recently participated in 
<br/>the Berlin World Games in Germany.  The Special Olympic Fiji returned home with three gold, six 
<br/>silver and four bronze medals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Winning 13 medals in total was an incredible fete for these dedicated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>athletes who gave their all and won medals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today I stand before this august Parliament to express our unwavering support for the recent 
<br/>Budget announcement for the new financial year.  As the Minister for Youths and Sports, I would 
<br/>like  to  acknowledge  and  commend  the  Government  for  its  steadfast  commitment  towards  the 
<br/>development  and empowerment  of our youths and the promotion of sports in  our great  nation.   I 
<br/>would like to take a moment to acknowledge and express my utmost appreciation for the leadership 
<br/>of  our  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sitiveni  Ligamamada  Rabuka.    As  a  newly  formed  Coalition 
<br/>Government, he has demonstrated exceptional dedication and vision to steering our nation towards 
<br/>prosperity and progress.  Under his guidance, we have witnessed a renewed commitment to the well-
<br/>being and empowerment of our youth and the promotion of sports in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics and his team for their tireless efforts in developing 
<br/>this  Budget.    Crafting  a  budget  that  addresses  the  diverse  needs  of  our  nation  is  a  complex  task 
<br/>requiring meticulous planning, consultation and foresights.  With his team, Government has ensured 
<br/>that the Budget reflects the priorities and aspirations of our people.  This is a Budget for a new Fiji 
<br/>where we, as a nation, are all building our future together.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in allocation of funds from $13.8 million to $19.5 million for 
<br/>the next financial year to implement youth and sports development programmes is a clear testament 
<br/>to the Government’s recognition of the importance of investing in our young people and harnessing 
<br/>the power of sports to drive economic growth and social cohesion.  With an allocation as such for 
<br/>Youth and Sports Development, the Ministry has been entrusted with the responsibility of shaping a 
<br/>brighter future for our nation guided by the principles of inclusivity, innovation and sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The significance of this Budget allocation cannot be understated as it provides us with the 
<br/>necessary resources to effectively execute our strategic plans and initiatives.  It is a clear indication 
<br/>of the Government’s  commitment to the well-being  and prosperity of our youths who make up a 
<br/>substantial  portion  of  our  population.    We  have  approximately  925,000  people  residing  in  our 
<br/>beautiful country and a significant 40 percent of this population consists of youth aged between 15 
<br/>years to 35 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, for sports which was once considered a mere recreational activity has transformed into 
<br/>a robust industry with significant economic potential for Fiji.  Therefore, recognising its importance 
<br/>and  providing  the  necessary  support  and  resources  to  ensure  its  continued  growth  and  success  is 
<br/>critical.  It is evident that investing in youth and sports is paramount to the overall future growth and 
<br/>development of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On youth development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Youths and Sports acknowledges 
<br/>the challenges faced by many young people, especially those who have fallen out of the mainstream 
<br/>education system.  The Ministry has recognised the importance of providing a safety net and a second 
<br/>chance to these individuals.  This Budget will strengthen our delivery at the community and at our 
<br/>Youth Training Centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  five  Training  Centres  across  Fiji  specialising  in  carpentry,  organic  agriculture, 
<br/>disaster  risk  reduction  and  climate  change  adaptation,  livestock  training  programmes,  music  and 
<br/>aquaculture.  Out of the five Youth Training Centres, four are currently in operation while the one in 
<br/>Yavitu,  Kadavu,  needs  to  be  restored  due  to  damages  sustained  during  </span><span>TC  Harold</span><span>  in  2020.  I  am 
<br/>happy to announce that there is funding allocated in this Budget for the restoration of this Youth 
<br/>Training Centre to ensure its full operation in the next financial year to serve the youths of Kadavu. 
<br/>These centres serve as platforms for skill development, providing opportunities for young people to 
<br/>learn and acquire available vocational skills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the geographical distribution of villages and youth clubs across Fiji adds 
<br/>another  layer  of  complexity  to  our  efforts.    Our  nation  comprises  many  remote  and  isolated 
<br/>communities making access to resources, education and opportunities a significant challenge for our 
<br/>young population.  It is crucial that we recognise unique circumstances faced by these communities 
<br/>and work towards bridging gap.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  increased  budget  will  assist  us  address  some  to  these  geographical 
<br/>barriers and provide equal access to resources and opportunities to ensure that no young person is 
<br/>left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  has  developed  strategic  plans  and 
<br/></span><span>initiatives focused on empowering our youth and fostering their holistic development.  We have set 
<br/>strategic goals that have encompassed areas such as productive and economically empowered youth, 
<br/>health and well-being and sports development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with these goals, we have implemented various milestones to drive our efforts forward. 
<br/>These milestones include initiatives such as youth, entrepreneurship programmes, grant assistance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1225 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for youth movement activities, the development of national youth policies, strengthening youth club 
<br/>registration and the establishment of co-operatives. Through these milestones, we aim to create an 
<br/>enabling environment that nurtures youth-led initiatives, supports their economic empowerment and 
<br/>encourages their active participation in national building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  Budget  supports  our  commitment  to  an  inclusive  and  equitable  youth 
<br/>development.  The  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  aims  to  implement  targeted  programmes  and 
<br/>initiatives specifically designed to address the needs of street youths.  In many of our major towns 
<br/>and  cities,  we  witness  the  unfortunate  sight  of  unemployed  and  marginalised  young  individuals 
<br/>struggling to find their place in society.  As a Ministry, we recognise the urgency of supporting and 
<br/>empowering  these  street  youths,  providing  them  with  the  necessary  tools  and  opportunities  for  a 
<br/>sustainable future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, we will emphasise the importance of mental health and well-being for our youth.  
<br/>Many  of  them  have  experienced  trauma,  abuse  and  neglect,  leaving  lasting  emotional  scars.    By 
<br/>offering  counselling  services,  mentorship  and  psychosocial  support,  we  aim  to  restore  their  self-
<br/>esteem resilience and overall well-being.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also I firmly believe that it is our responsibility to equip our youth with the 
<br/>knowledge and skills necessary to understand and respond to the challenges posed by climate change 
<br/>and  natural  disasters.    I  am  pleased  to  inform  that  the  budget  allocation  for  Youth  and  Sports 
<br/>Development recognises the significance of this issue and provide ample support to ensure our youth 
<br/>are  well  informed  and  prepared.  This  is  accomplished  through  our  Certificate  I  in  Resilience 
<br/>Programme offered at our Youth Training Centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As custodians of our nation’s future, our youth must be empowered to understand and respond 
<br/>to these challenges effectively. By integrating these topics into our educational programmes, youth 
<br/>clubs and community activities, we can foster a generation of informed and resilient individuals who 
<br/>are equipped to mitigate the impacts of climate change and effectively respond to natural disasters.  
<br/>We will also collaborate with relevant stakeholders including international organisations, NGOs and 
<br/>local communities to explore new technologies and best practices. This collaboration will provide 
<br/>our youth with valuable opportunities for knowledge exchange, capacity building and the sharing of 
<br/>experiences in addressing climate related challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our commitment to fostering productive and economically empowered 
<br/>youth, it is crucial that we provide the necessary support and resources for income generating projects 
<br/>amongst other youth led initiatives.  Recognising the potential and entrepreneurial spirit of our young 
<br/>people, I am delighted to note that the budget allocation for Youth and Sports Development includes 
<br/>grants, specifically aimed at supporting income generating projects for our youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Youth Entrepreneurship  is  a powerful  tool  for  economic growth,  job  creation and poverty 
<br/>reduction. By encouraging and supporting our young people in their entrepreneurial endeavours, we 
<br/>empower them to become self-reliant, contribute to the economy and drive innovation. These income 
<br/>generating projects not only provide financial stability but also instil valuable skills, confidence and 
<br/>a  sense  of  purpose  in  our  youth.  Moreover,  the  grants  for  income  generating  projects  serve  as  a 
<br/></span><span>steppingstone for our youth to explore and capitalise on emerging economic sectors.  It is important 
<br/></span><span>to note that these grants are not merely financial support but also come with mentorship and guidance. 
<br/>This  holistic  approach  ensures  that  our  young  entrepreneurs  have  access  to  the  tools  and  support 
<br/>systems necessary for long-term success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Sports  Development,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budget  announcement  reflects  the 
<br/>Government’s recognition of the emerging potential of the sports sector as a strong contributor to our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economy.  The  funding  in  the  next  financial  year  will  enable  us  to  replace  the  National  Stadium 
<br/>synthetic tracks that is in dire need of repairs. It will also enable us to develop sports fields, indoor 
<br/>facilities,  hard  courts,  enhance  sports  tourism  promotion  through  hosting  of  international 
<br/>tournaments, provide sports grant for persons with disabilities and support the development of high-
<br/>performance athletes and facilities. By doing so, we create an environment that encourages sports 
<br/>participation, fosters talent development and position’s Fiji as a leading sporting destination in the 
<br/>region.  This funding also provides relevant support for the administration of the Fiji National Sports 
<br/>Commission, Fiji Sports Council and the Boxing Commission of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Fiji National Sports Commission, we implement sports outreach 
<br/>programmes  in  communities.    Beyond  the  individual  benefits,  sports  development  also  has  a 
<br/>profound  impact  on  our  communities.  Through  this  Budget,  we  will  engage  and  empower 
<br/>communities to tap into their untapped sports potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many talented individuals reside in our rural communities, and they lack the resources and 
<br/>opportunities to showcase their skills and reach their full potential.  By investing in grassroots sports 
<br/>initiatives, sports skills, administration skills and strengthening community sports associations, we 
<br/>can unearth hidden talents, nurture aspiring athletes and transform them into medal prospects in Fiji.  
<br/>This not only brings pride to our nation, but also inspires future generations and serves as a catalyst 
<br/>for community development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  I  would  like  to  inform  that  this  Budget  also  supports  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity for overseas sporting tours.  Major sporting tours in the new financial year, includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Rugby  World  Cup  Preparation  and  participation,  Pacific  Games  Preparation  and  HSBC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sevens; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Touch Rugby World Cup; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>World Athletics Championships, Pacific Games Preparations; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>World Bowls Championships, Champion versus Champion and World Indoor Singles; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Cricket  Twenty-20  Pacific  Cup,  ICC  Women’s  Twenty-20  World  Cup  East  Asia  Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Qualifier, ICC Women’s Under 19 Cricket World Cup,East Asia Pacific Qualifier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  tours  provide  our  athletes  with  valuable  exposure,  enabling  them  to  compete  with 
<br/>international counterparts and gain valuable experience.  Such experiences not only enhance their 
<br/>skills  and performance, but  also  promote cross-cultural  exchange, fostering greater understanding 
<br/>and appreciation among nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget allocation allows us to focus on the development 
<br/>of coaches and trainers.  Coaches play a pivotal role in nurturing talent, honing skills and guiding our 
<br/>athletes  towards  success.    By  investing  in  the  development  and  capacity  building  of  coaches,  we 
<br/>ensure  that  our  athletes  receive  the  best  possible  guidance  and  support.    This,  in  turn,  leads  to 
<br/>improved  performance,  increased  competitiveness  and  greater  potential  for  success  at  regional, 
<br/>international and even Olympic levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is imperative that we recognise the pivotal  role that sports plays in  combatting the high 
<br/>incidence  rate  of  NCDs  in  Fiji.    By  investing  in  sports,  we  not  only  strengthen  our  communities 
<br/>through  social  cohesion  but  also  promote  physical  activities  and  healthier  lifestyles,  thereby 
<br/>addressing the pressing issues of NCDs.  This budget allocation for youth and sports development 
<br/>recognises the potential of sports in addressing these health challenges and places a strong emphasis 
<br/>on promoting active lifestyles among our population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, like any other nations, faces a substantial challenge in combatting NCDs.  These diseases 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1227 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity have become a growing concern impacting health and 
<br/>well-being of our population.  The statistics are alarming with a high prevalence of NCDs affecting 
<br/>both young and old alike.  As a nation, we can afford to overlook the profound consequences of this 
<br/>health crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports with its inherent focus on physical activity, offers a powerful solution to combat NCDs 
<br/>and  promote  overall  health  and  wellness.    By  engaging  in  sports  and  regular  physical  activity, 
<br/>individuals  can  reduce  their  risk  of  developing  chronic  diseases,  improve  cardiovascular  health, 
<br/>enhance mental well-being and maintain a healthy weight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sports strengthen communities through social cohesion.  When individuals 
<br/>come together to participate in sports activities, whether as athletes, spectators or volunteers, they 
<br/>forge bonds, build relationships  and foster a sense of belonging.  Sports create a shared sense of 
<br/>purpose transcending  social, cultural  and economic barriers.  By investing in  sports, we invest in 
<br/>social capital, promoting unity, inclusivity and a sense of pride in a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recent years, Fiji has witnessed remarkable achievements and outstanding performances 
<br/>by  our  athletes  at  the  Olympic  Games  and  various  international  sporting  events.    These 
<br/>accomplishments have brought immense pride and joy to our nation, inspiring young athletes and 
<br/>capturing the attention of the global sporing community.  With such success, it becomes inclusively 
<br/>crucial for us to prioritise anti-doping measures to protect the integrity of our athletes and reputation 
<br/>of our sporting achievements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  an  immediate  need,  we  must  emphasise  and  promote  clean  and  fair 
<br/>competition, ensuring that our athletes participate in sports with integrity and without resorting to 
<br/>performance-enhancing  substances.    I am pleased to  announce that the new budget  allocation for 
<br/>youth and sports development includes provisions for the establishment of a National Anti-Doping 
<br/>Organisation for Fiji, emphasising our commitment to uphold international standards and promoting 
<br/>clean sports and progressively as part of the Ministry’s Strategic Plan equip the organisation with the 
<br/>infrastructure, personnel and testing facilities required to effectively carry out its mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  organisation  will  play  a  pivotal  role  implementing  robust  anti-doping  policies, 
<br/>conducting thorough testings, procedures and educating athletes about the dangers and consequences 
<br/>of doping.  By doing so, we not only safeguard the health and well-being of our athletes, but also 
<br/>maintain a level playing field for a fair competition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  deliberate  on  the  budget  allocation  for  our  youth  and  sports 
<br/>development, I thank the Government for recognising the immense possibilities that lie within the 
<br/>world of sports.  The returns of investments are not merely financial but extend to social, cultural and 
<br/>national pride.  By supporting our athletes, investing in coaching and community development and 
<br/>unlocking  under  potential  in  our  communities,  we  create  a  future  where  Fiji  is  renowned  for  its 
<br/>sporting excellence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, while it is important to acknowledge that not all our budget requests have been 
<br/>fully captured, we must commend the Government for its prudent fiscal management and the fair 
<br/></span><span>distribution of resourced across various sectors.  We understand that there are competing priorities 
<br/></span><span>and tough decisions must be made to ensure the optimal utilisation of funds.  Nevertheless, as the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Youths  and  Sports,  we  are  committed  to  working  within  the  allocated  budget  and 
<br/>exploring alternative avenues to bridge any gaps that may arise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  we  recognise  the  importance  of  collaboration  and  partnership  in  achieving  our 
<br/>goals, we will actively seek partnerships with corporate organisations, educational institutions and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>peace, progress, equality, tranquillity and above all reassured security so that all could live without 
<br/>any form of fear or intimidation regardless of where one lives.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me rewind and take the people of our nation to the opening remarks made 
<br/>by the former Minister of Economy, Mr. Khaiyum, in the 2022-2023 FijiFirst National Budget, and 
<br/>I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This is the fourth National Budget that we have announced since the beginning of 
<br/>the pandemic. This Budget is different from the three before because the worst economic 
<br/>crisis in our history is over and our recovery is here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We promised you in the darkest days of the crisis that our economy would not just 
<br/>recover  but  would  emerge  from  the  pandemic  with  pace  and  resilience.  Through 
<br/>government’s  foresight  and  decisive  leadership  and  with  the  tremendous  support  and 
<br/>participation of the Fijian people, we delivered on that promise.  This Budget is possible 
<br/>because of what we did together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The blueprint for our next financial year is as prudent, responsible and visionary as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any we have mentioned or announced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  rests  on  the  pillars  of  infrastructure,  education  and  health,  and  is  built  on  the 
<br/>values  that  our  Prime  Minister  has  made  this  moral  and  political  mission  -  family, 
<br/>security, justice, true democracy and equal opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget creates the certainty that our businesses need to plan, invest and hire. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And as prices of food, fuel, freight and fertilizer remain extremely unpredictable, 
<br/>this Budget provides relief for the families who need it most.  It is  wholly the strength 
<br/>and speed of our economic recovery that makes all of this possible.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2022-2023  FijiFirst  Budget  has  set  the  platform  for  our  nation’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic recovery after the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me briefly highlight some of the key aspects of that Budget: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of Vitilevu Cross-Country Highway 
<br/>Funds  have  been  allocated  for  FRA  to  undertake  a  pre-feasibility  investigation  into  the 
<br/>construction  of  the  Viti  Levu  cross-country  highway.    Thus,  will  create  a  greater  social 
<br/>mobility and a huge opportunity for commercial, industrial and tourism expansion throughout 
<br/>Vitilevu interior.  This will be Fiji’s first ever toll road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strata Title Housing Quarters for Civil Servants 
<br/>Initiatives will be put in place for development of quarters through strata title which will be 
<br/>exclusively for civil servants.  This initiative will ensure that civil servants can affordably 
<br/>own homes and alleviate pressure on the wider housing market.  To start off, the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force will be the ones to take advantage of this initiative.

<div><span>Shuttle Bus Pilot Programme 
<br/>Electrical  public  transport  expected  to  be  implemented  by  the  end  of  the  year,  providing 
<br/>services to 13 routes in the greater Nasinu area.  $4 million is being allocated to introduce the 
<br/>first ever electrical public transportation in Fiji.

<br/>and,  that  is,  payment  of  base  fees,  PSV  driver  licence  fees,  stall  fees  for  market  vendors, 
<br/>inshore fishing fees will continue for the next 12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  number  of  new  measures  were  announced  in  the  2022-2023  National 
<br/>Budget, trying to support the most vulnerable in the country.  In order to curb the inflationary rate in 
<br/>Fiji, the Bainimarama Government had announced to implement financial support measures such as 
<br/>bus fare assistance, support for tertiary students, social welfare support and tax measures to support 
<br/>businesses in Fiji to cope with the rising prices in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bainimarama Government has also allocated funds for reprioritizing resources towards 
<br/>infrastructure  development,  providing  provision  of  public  services  and  social  safety  measures  to 
<br/>protect the disadvantaged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FijiFirst  2022-2023  National  Budget  was  tailormade  to  improve 
<br/>efficiency and ease cost of living and doing business in Fiji. However, the same cannot be said of 
<br/>this 2023-2024 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget Debate of yesterday and today by both sides of this Chamber 
<br/>has revealed the extent of political  disputation we have in  our Parliamentary democracy.  This  is 
<br/>nothing new and expected in a young and shinning democracy like ours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Opposition  Members  have  raised  important  issues  and  constructive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suggestions have been made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government must present a well-balanced assessment on the state of 
<br/>our growing economy, acknowledging the way and manner in which the Bainimarama Government 
<br/>was able to rebuild our nation after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and mitigate the devastating global pandemic and 
<br/>invigorating our economy.  The Government must come up with practical solutions that can propel 
<br/>our nation to achieve better economic growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a growing number of Fijians are in in secure work, many have resigned and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moved to find better opportunities elsewhere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key measures in this Budget should be about setting Fijians on a course 
<br/>for the next decade and beyond, achieving our targets set in the National Development Plan 2020.  
<br/>And when those measures are wasteful, or unfair, or short-sighted, or just plain wrong, then in the 
<br/>long run, it is the whole country that suffers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1231 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the values contained in our 2013 Constitution are essential in creating the 
<br/>nation  we  want  for  all  Fijians.  And  it  calls  for  accountability,  impartiality  and  openness  in 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our beloved Constitution calls for a society that is based on human dignity, 
<br/>rights and freedom.  The values enshrined in our 2013 Constitution demands us to treat one another 
<br/>with respect, integrity, responsibility and compassion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government was committed to providing clean and safe water 
<br/>in  adequate  quantities  and  proper  and  adequate  sanitation  for  every  Fijian  household.    The 
<br/>Constitution guarantees the right of every Fijian to clean and safe water in adequate quantities, and 
<br/>accessible and adequate sanitation facilities.  Realizing this entitlement will ensure improved living 
<br/>standards with positive spillover benefits to the entire economy.  The FijiFirst plan was for the next 
<br/>five  years  was  to  undertake  major  investments  to  cater  for  long  term  water  supply  needs  in  the 
<br/>following regard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resources  will  be  allocated  for  construction  of  new  water  treatment  plants,  reticulation 
<br/>systems and reservoirs to increase supply capacity.  An aggressive leakage reduction programme to 
<br/>eliminate water loss will be pursued. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the development of potential new water sources, Government with the assistance 
<br/>from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Green Climate Fund (GCF) and European Investment 
<br/>Bank (EIB), is embarking on the construction of a new 40 megalitre treatment plant on the Rewa 
<br/>River to meet the increasing demand for water in the greater Suva and Nausori areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) was to explore options for other new 
<br/>dam sites such as at Waibogi in the upper reaches of Navua River and the upper Waimanu River, as 
<br/>well as in the Western Division to meet the increasing demand in the Nadi-Lautoka corridor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investments was to be made to renew existing water infrastructure, including 
<br/>pipeline replacement, construction and upgrade of water reticulation  systems,  electrical  upgrades, 
<br/>valve replacements, reservoir upgrades and reducing non-revenue water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Options  for  enhanced  rainwater  harvesting  and  storage,  industrial  recycling,  storm  water 
<br/>management,  aquifer  management  and  the  use  of  renewable  energy  technologies  for  desalination 
<br/>plants in remote locations will be explored on a continuing basis and implemented where feasible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, free water tanks were distributed to the rural and maritime communities to 
<br/>harvest rainwater.  For the remote island communities, funding was available to develop groundwater 
<br/>sources and diesel-powered water-desalination plants.  The continuation of the Free Water Initiative 
<br/>for households with combined household income of $30,000 that are consuming less than 91,250 
<br/>litres per year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  must  engage  the  platform  set  by  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government in addressing the challenges of the Water Sector.  It must redouble its efforts to mitigate 
<br/></span><span>the intermittent water cuts, especially in the greater Suva area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  concluding  the  2022-2023  FijiFirst  Budget,  the  former  Minister  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economy, Mr. Khaiyum, remarked, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This budget is compassionate.  It is sensible.  It is disciplined. It is the budget that the 
<br/>nation needs, Mr. Speaker, that our people need; our businesses need; and that our recovery needs

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to sustain itself for years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inflation is rising. This budget mitigates it, especially for those most vulnerable.  Our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economy is surging.   This budget strengthens it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Job numbers are increasing.  This budget adds to them.  Climate events are becoming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more devastating.  This budget strengthens our infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are realistic about the threats we face.  Ambitious for our country and children and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>optimistic about what can be achieved.’’  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  compared  to  that,  this  Coalition  Budget  fails  to  fully  address  the  nation’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unemployment issue. It will benefit only one class of people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget will definitely create a growing inequality between rich and poor.  
<br/>Money is not being spent on the middle class and also fails to provide schemes and subsidies for the small 
<br/>businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Bainimarama Government, many Fijians have risen above the poverty 
<br/>line. With no incentive in this Budget, they will fall below it.  Measures imposed will not benefit the 
<br/>people but will break their backs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a dark budget and offers no ray of hope for the poor, the underprivileged 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the disabled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the immediate task of the Government now is to emerge from this debate with 
<br/>a  common  determination  and  continue  the  policies  set  by  the  Bainimarama  Government  and  better 
<br/>manage the economy and meet the challenges of the present and renew the commitment the Bainimarama 
<br/>Government had to our nation that no one is left behind and aspire to better the life of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I finish off, I would like to congratulate our National Under 19 Football 
<br/>Team that played the final of the Oceania Nations Qualification Championship for the World Cup Play 
<br/>Off and they lost to the mountainous New Zealand.  I have to congratulate the Fiji Football Association 
<br/>President, Rajesh Patel; the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mohammed Yusuf; and the coaches, for a job 
<br/>well done and we are the second best in the Oceania Nations Qualification Championship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity and I do not support this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, guests in the gallery and those watching livestream of 
<br/>proceedings from their homes; I rise to join my fellow colleagues in my wholesome support of the 2023-
<br/>2024 National Budget, as delivered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance 
<br/>and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  for  an 
<br/>exceptionally  well-presented  Budget.    After  a  long  time,  a  budget  has  been  timely  delivered  and 
<br/>conducted in the normal business hours.  A Budget for the new Fiji, as stated by my other colleagues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go any further, I would just like to respond to some remarks that were 
<br/>made by honourable Members of the Opposition.  First of all, honourable Hem Chand questioned whether 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1233 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the executive teacher positions would be reinstated.  I am sure honourable Chand was listening to the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education and I am very thankful to the honourable Minister for Education for 
<br/>reinstating a host of benefits and provisions that were taken away during the reign of his Government in 
<br/>the last 10 years; during the reign of the four, five or six Ministers that he worked with as Head of Human 
<br/>Resources (HR) and the then equal number of Permanent Secretaries by the way.  I am sure the teachers 
<br/>are now smiling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Executive teacher positions are also coming, and the honourable Minister has already alluded to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that.  I think you missed it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, I heard.  When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Alright, you wait for it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to briefly respond to honourable Naivalurua when he alluded 
<br/>to the fact that we need counsellors.  Yes, I fully agree.  We need counsellors for our young people and.  
<br/>Again,  as  a  cost  cutting  measure  in  2010,  the  FijiFirst  Government  removed  the  Executive  Teacher 
<br/>positions that were in 28 secondary schools in Fiji.  That had been their existence since 1999 and despite 
<br/>numerous requests by the Teachers Unions, they did not, of course, reinstate that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the honourable Minister has assured me that those positions are coming back.  There is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing much to do, all those teachers are there.  All we need to do is to reappoint them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the graduate teachers are also receiving their full salary 
<br/>now after so many years.  Honourable Premila Kumar is sitting there, I came to see her.  The only meeting 
<br/>I ever had with the Ministry of Education in my former role during her reign was when honourable Chand 
<br/>was the head of HR.  She was of the view that those teachers who were on higher salary as graduates as 
<br/>evaluated by the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) should be brought down to Step 1 rather than taking those 
<br/>up.  If honourable Hem Chand was man enough, he would have said yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the Budget, it has received overwhelming support and messages 
<br/>of appreciation from all sectors of the community, including a public statement by the CEO of the Fiji 
<br/>Commerce and Employers Federation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- This man never saw Geneva. That is why he does not know Geneva.  I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tell you about Geneva soon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget is for rebuilding our future together under the strong and unwavering leadership of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe the Opposition must be living on another planet because I do not know 
<br/></span><span>where they get their information from that people are unhappy.    They voted for you then, they will not 
<br/></span><span>vote anymore for you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted by the honourable Prime Minister in his address to the nation, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Coalition Government is designed by three words - freedom, unity and progress, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in rebuilding Fiji together which is reflective of the scope that we will together with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>1234 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders and development partners to develop our nation towards sustainable prosperity.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above statement further underscores the commitment by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister that the Coalition Government is the Government of every Fijian for every Fijian.  Unlike 
<br/>the previous Government which practised double standards, used divisive strategies and was selective on 
<br/>whom they want to help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This 2023-2024 Budget has been formulated to assist all Fijians, irrespective of their political 
<br/>affiliations and aspirations.  The Budget has been crafted with realism in response to real issues that 
<br/>our country is facing, but at the same time, identified strategies for economic growth to rebuilding 
<br/>the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Coalition  Government’s  approach  is  to  listen  to  the  people 
<br/>through genuine engagement and consultations with all stakeholders. This is to ensure we prioritise 
<br/>areas badly neglected by the previous Government for the 16 years they were there, for example, 
<br/>education, health, infrastructure like water, and agriculture, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last 16 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been a tumultuous chapter in our independent history. 
<br/>We will continue to experience the effects of bad governance for quite some years to come.  But 
<br/>under the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister, the Coalition Government will forge ahead 
<br/>to ensure national interest prevails at all times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  achieving  this,  the  Budget  reflects  the  collaborative  strategies  of  the 
<br/>Coalition Government.  My Ministry’s vision of “Decent Work and Sustainable  Employment For 
<br/>All”,  accentuate  the  mission  to  “Promote  decent  work  opportunities,  ensure  safe  and  healthy 
<br/>workplaces, enhance productivity and encourage good faith employment relations”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is fulfilling the rebuilding of our nation through the revamping 
<br/>of our tripartite machinery, allowing the spirit the tripartism and good faith employment relations to 
<br/>be at the centre of all discussions as a recognised approach that strengthens our ability to meet both, 
<br/>domestic and global challenges, and workforce demands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had alluded to in this Parliament earlier, the Labour Laws were changed 
<br/>drastically in the past decade to curtail the rights of workers, unions and their leaders.  Fiji had been 
<br/>repeatedly  cited  for  numerous  breaches  of  the  Core  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) 
<br/>Conventions and blatant non-compliance with the joint implementation agreements signed in Geneva 
<br/>in 2015 and, again, in 2016.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had a very, very, very bad international image.  
<br/>ILO is an organisation of 187 countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first truly tripartite delegation to the International Labour Conference in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over a decade was last month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hogwash!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The CEO of the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation, as well the 
<br/></span><span>National Secretary of the Fiji Trades Union Congress, requested me, as the Leader of the delegation, 
<br/></span><span>to address the Conference on behalf of the entire delegation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also met with the Director General of ILO, as well as the Director Labour Standards, as 
<br/>a team. They were delighted to hear about the progress we have made in the short span of six months 
<br/>to restore the fundamental trade union and human rights.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The icing on the cake was the address by His Excellency the President, who was one of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>selected Heads of States invited to do so, the first ever in Fiji’s history, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  predecessor did  not  attend a single  International  Labour Conference 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during his term of four years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Understandable, of course, Mr. Speaker.  How could he face the barrage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of questions that were waiting for him? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, his Master had prepared all of it for him to go and answer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he also would have to answer... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- …how the National  Secretary of the  Fiji  Trade Union  Congress  got 
<br/>arrested by Police from inside the Office Boardroom at Level 4 in the presence of the Director ILO 
<br/>South Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he left this onerous task of going to Geneva and facing the embarrassment 
<br/>to  his  staff  -  the  Permanent  Secretary  and  the  rest  of  them.  They  told  me  that  they  were  very 
<br/>embarrassed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, he has the audacity to question our travels.  You will never understand because you are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over schooled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, work is in progress to complete this exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at that point in time, honourable Bala really intended to resolve 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that impasse and he wanted to travel to Geneva but his Masters have other ideas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- That is how that arrest took place, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can you name who was my Master? 
<br/>As a matter of interest, I want to know who my Master was?  The rule is not only for Opposition, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rules apply to everyone. I want him to name who my Master was?  If you are 
<br/>man enough...

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You keep quiet, I said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, let me continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  The  2023-2024  Budget  will  assist  the  Ministry  in  ensuring  that  we 
<br/>execute our target within the 12 months.  Our commitments to deliver on our promises and objectives 
<br/>to our people is not just to fulfil the budgetary requirements but it is underpinned by our values and 
<br/>principles to serve and provide excellent services to our community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the much-publicised economic boom or the ‘Bainimarama Boom’, as was 
<br/>described by the former Minister for Economy himself, I believe, was only a dream.  The current 
<br/>projection by the honourable Minister of Finance is realistic and achievable. It has given us the boost 
<br/>and confidence in planning for the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, its common knowledge that Fiji is a small island nation but intertwined by 
<br/>global  and  socio  geopolitical  interventions  and  conflicts,  COVID-19  pandemic,  interventions  in 
<br/>oceans and climate change, et cetera, that impacted our people and country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we must not forget that while we had little or no control over those events, our 
<br/>country suffered its fair share of man-made disaster that left this country with the huge debt as a 
<br/>result of poor and dictatorial leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst I acknowledge some progress made in the last 16 years of COVID-
<br/>19  (honourable  Bala  should  be  happy),  I  am  also  challenged  by  my  conviction  that  the  previous 
<br/>Government had also created an environment of mistrust and fear - a Government that brought pain 
<br/>to  our  citizens  via  arbitrary  rules  and  laws  that  impinge  on    workers’  rights,  banned  tripartism, 
<br/>suppression of unions, arbitrary termination of workers, inhumane treatment of people, huge financial 
<br/>debts, unemployment, et cetera. .   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  Ministry will continue to  maintain an efficient  and effective service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delivery under this new budgetary allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue to deliver quality services to the diverse range of stakeholders, who have a 
<br/>wider impact on our budget.  I thank the honourable Minister of Finance for providing my Ministry 
<br/>with  an extra $302,600,  that will ensure the efficiency of operations through the provision  of the 
<br/>much-needed resources on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this includes 11 new staff that we are going to recruit, and I have alluded to 
<br/></span><span>this Parliament earlier, again, that there are 46 positions that have remained vacant for almost three 
<br/>years and because of that, my staff were overworked.  Out of that, we have filled 19 pre-budget and 
<br/>the 10 additional ones are now coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that we have inherited a public debt of close to $10 billion.  
<br/>With that in mind, we will have to ensure that our resources are fully utilised and rightfully invested 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1237 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in order to extract the much-needed revenue and returns that will assist Government in mitigating its 
<br/>financial burden.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the theme, “Building our future together”, my Ministry firmly believes 
<br/>that  Fiji’s  Labour  Mobility  Programme  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  our  economic  recovery  efforts 
<br/>through remittances from all our Fijian workers abroad.  Last year, our Labour Mobility Programme 
<br/>under  our  bilateral  arrangement  with  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  saw  the  participation  of  4,072 
<br/>Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  during  the  delivery  of  his  Budget 
<br/>Address, remittances crossed the billion-dollar mark last year and is likely to cross the $1.2 billion 
<br/>mark by the end of this year.  This is very significant in relation to strengthening our Labour Mobility 
<br/>Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is for the above reason that I wish to acknowledge the honourable Minister and his team 
<br/>for  their  kind  consideration  in  providing  the  necessary  funding  to  support  our  Labour  Mobility 
<br/>Programme.    The  allocation  funding  for  another  five  project  officers  to  assist  our  Foreign 
<br/>Employment Service under NEC will bring the much-needed relief to our team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with our growing numbers under the programme, welfare issues are also 
<br/>growing, and the budgetary provision of $250,000 to support the recruitment of an additional Liaison 
<br/>Officer and the setup of a toll-free line for Australia, is a testament of the Coalition Government’s 
<br/>commitment in ensuring that the welfare of our workers, while they are abroad, is fully taken care 
<br/>of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had earlier stated that the Australian Government had allocated $100,000 
<br/>in 2021 for us to appoint a Liaison Officer.  That was languishing somewhere until I took office, and 
<br/>I am happy to report that we have now completed the exercise and the incumbent should be reporting 
<br/>to work in the next few weeks.  Now, we will have two Liaison Officers in Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is actioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In noting the gaps that are being created by our workers who have joined the Labour Mobility 
<br/>Programmes and the honourable Minister of Finance’s statement on the huge responsibility to rebuild 
<br/>our technical education system, as well as address the skills gap issue, I wish to put on record my 
<br/>Ministry’s commitment to work closely with  the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders in 
<br/>addressing the current challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Labour Mobility Programme is currently under review and our Permanent Secretary has 
<br/>already started working in identifying strategies to mitigate various complaints and issues from both, 
<br/>employers and employees abroad.  These issues are in various forms and is largely due to the previous 
<br/>Government’s negligence on the duty of care of our citizens.  For example, since 2018, the previous 
<br/>Government made only one visitation to New Zealand to meet employers and workers, but none to 
<br/></span><span>Australia where the bulk of the workers are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes, tell those to the workers, they will fix you right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My team is currently working on a new Labour Mobility Framework and matrix and plans to

<div><span>meet  its  counterparts  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  to  strengthen  the  programme  and  mitigate 
<br/>workers and employers issues.  Again, the Opposition will accuse us of traveling for joy.  I invite 
<br/>them to ask those workers, they will get an earful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the restoration of the 18 percent FNPF contributions from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2024 
<br/>is good news for our workers because it will contribute more to their lifelong savings and investment 
<br/>ability.  A further welcoming news is the FNPF proposal to set up offshore operations, which will 
<br/>extend membership of Fijians in Australia and New Zealand.  This means that our Fijian workers in 
<br/>New  Zealand  and  Australia  will  have  the  opportunity  to  access  FNPF  services  and  have  their 
<br/>deductions done there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $2,556,500 has been allocated to the National OHS Service and Workers 
<br/>Compensation Service, and my Ministry is fully responsible to ensure that these laws are enforced, 
<br/>and compliance is in practice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to formulate new OHS laws and revise the laws 
<br/>that are now archaic or obsolete – the Health and Safety at Work (Construction) Regulations, the 
<br/>Health and Safety at Work (Amusement Rides) Code of Practice, and other laws.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also are responsible for Workers Compensation, and we are happy that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have an allocation of $500,000 to make sure injured workers are taken care of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the restoration of the tripartite arrangement, my Ministry will ensure 
<br/>that both the workers and employers are respected through dialogue, consultation, good faith and 
<br/>negotiations and this is ongoing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  provisions  allocated  for  labour  compliance  standards,  we  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to strengthen our enforcement and address issues in a timely manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mediation  service, Mr.  Speaker, we have  a very  competent  Mediation  Team  and we have 
<br/>been allocated $778,200 to carry out this work in the new financial year.  Our mediators continue to 
<br/>promote  cordial  employment  relations,  promoting  good  faith,  health  and  safety,  productivity  and 
<br/>social duties to guide parties, creating harmonious and productive industrial relations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reiterate what was mentioned by the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance regarding the levy for NTPC or the levy for workers’ in-service training.  The in-service 
<br/>training of 1 percent was deducted and kept by NTPC for in-service training, productivity training, 
<br/>as well as apprenticeship schemes.  This was distributed in this manner - 40 percent for Accident 
<br/>Compensation  Commission;  50  percent  to  medical  insurance  levy  and  10  percent  to  productivity 
<br/>training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 90 percent of the funds are no longer available to employers for training 
<br/>purposes, and this is a very serious state of affairs.  We are intending to review this and ensure that 
<br/>the 1 percent levy comes back for the in-service training of workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is a balanced and strong Budget. With decisive social policies 
<br/></span><span>by the Coalition Government, it will ensure that people in our communities are supported through its 
<br/>benefits which will open up greater opportunities to all our citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to clean up the mess created by 16 years of poor governance and build the economy, 
<br/>while we take care of those in need - eight years extended to another eight years.  This Budget clearly 
<br/>demonstrates that we have a workable plan to enable us to do so.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no looking back, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Coalition Government has demonstrated its 
<br/>pre-election commitment of being a government of empathy, care and compassion. This Budget is, 
<br/>undoubtedly, the beginning of the greater good that lies ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the privilege to speak on the Budget and I fully support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion to approve the 2023-2024 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, fellow honourable Members of Parliament and all Fijians watching this proceeding 
<br/>from around the world; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>, a very good evening, </span><span>salam alaykum</span><span> and </span><span>Jai Siya Ram</span><span> to all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can safely say that 2023-2024 National Budget, presented by honourable 
<br/>Rabuka’s Government through the honourable Minister of Finance will go through as the worst in 
<br/>Fiji’s history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After treating Fijians with false promises all through last year’s campaign, and then again, 
<br/>during Budget  consultation,  the Coalition Government has completely  failed to  deliver on its big 
<br/>promises.  They say, “You should promise small and deliver big”, but the Coalition Government has 
<br/>gone and done the opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has presented the largest spending Budget in Fiji’s history, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  excluding  the  pandemic  years.    However,  this  Budget  is  actually  a  discreet  move  of  the 
<br/>Government,  and  it  is  the  highly  operational  Budget  and  a  low  capital  expenditure  Budget.    The 
<br/>operational  expenditure  has  increased  by  $437  million  while  the  capital  expenditure  has  only 
<br/>increased by $28 million.  This means that the Government is spending more money on day-to-day 
<br/>operations, such as salaries and wages and less money on investment in infrastructure and other long-
<br/>term projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has been comparing this Budget to the last year’s Budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and talking about the debt.  But they have failed to explain to the people of Fiji the truth behind that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018-2019, the economy was enjoying good growth and the deficit was below $500 million 
<br/>a year.  However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the economy to suffer, and the deficit was 
<br/>increased significantly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  has  taken  steps  to  save  the  economy,  such  as  borrowing  money  and 
<br/>providing financial assistance to businesses.  These measures were necessary to prevent the economy 
<br/>from stalling, but they have also increased the debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government should be transparent about debt and explain to the people of Fiji how it 
<br/>plans to repay it. The Government should also focus on investing its capital expenditure project, such 
<br/>as infrastructure, to help economic growth in the long-term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they painted a picture that debt  is  bad, but  they do not understand debt.  
<br/>They exploded people’s fear to win the vote and even to this day, they go on about the national deb.  
<br/></span><span>They know very well that our debt is not out of control when they took power.  But now, we hear 
<br/></span><span>that in the first three months in office, the Minister has borrowed over $200 million and even now, 
<br/>refinance our loan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His action in the last six months has led to a significant increase in national debt, suppressing 
<br/>$10 billion - a level that was never reached during FijiFirst’s tenure, even amidst the challenges posed 
<br/>by  COVID-19.    So,  now  I  guess,  that  is  alright  for  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister of Finance and honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.  This Budget lacks 
<br/>concrete plan for sustainable economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The emphasis on operational expenditure indicates that the deficit will persist in the long-
<br/>term, resulting in the continuous accumulation of debt.  There is no tangible strategy, no plan, no 
<br/>innovation whatsoever, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how can I not mention the increase in VAT on majority of the goods and 
<br/>services from 9 percent to 15 percent. They have said that duty will be reduced, but when you take 
<br/>into account that VAT will increase by 6 percent, most of the savings they brag about will be nullified 
<br/>by the increase of VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This greedy action was recommended by the Fiscal Review Committee, led by the National 
<br/>Federation Party’s Richard Naidu and failed politician candidate, and friends of the Coalition, none 
<br/>of whom have accomplished, experience or expertise required to make such a call. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Fiscal Review Committee was solely rejected by Fijians with many of the consultation 
<br/>venues having low or even zero attendance, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yet, somehow, they deemed the need 
<br/>for an increase in taxes.  I challenge the Coalition Government to make public all submissions made 
<br/>on the Budget, and we would like to count how many Fijians are asked to pay more VAT during the 
<br/>inflation crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  cost  of  goods  is  more  expensive  now  than  ever  before  and  this  will  get  worse,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. Honourable Tabuya called for a VAT increase to 12.5 percent an inhumane act back 
<br/>when she was in Opposition, but the Minister who is supposed to be alleviating poverty is all of a 
<br/>sudden agreeing with the higher VAT increase now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- When you were on this side! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such a steep rise in VAT will significantly raise the cost of living for ordinary citizens, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  The already recorded price of essential goods and services will skyrocket even more, 
<br/>putting the heavy burden on hardworking individuals and families who are already struggling to make 
<br/>ends meet.  Basic necessities like food utilities and healthcare will become increasingly unaffordable, 
<br/>eroding the quality of life for many. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cost of production goes up, Mr. Speaker.  This VAT increase will directly impact the 
<br/>purchasing  power of our citizens.   As prices soar, the supposed income  will diminish, leading  to 
<br/>reduced consumer spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is simple Mr. Speaker, Sir, this decline in demand will have far reaching consequences for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>businesses particularly MSMEs that heavily rely on local customers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Small businesses will face higher cost of raw materials, supplies and services, eating into their 
<br/>already tight profit margin. This additional financial burden will force some MSMEs to make difficult 
<br/>decision,  such  as  downsizing  the  workforce  or  as  the  worst-case  scenario,  closing  their  doors 
<br/>permanently as we are already seeing all over Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1241 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such an outcome would not only impact employment but also stiffle entrepreneurship and 
<br/>hinder economic growth in our nation.  Mr. Speaker, MSMEs are also being further bludgeoned by 
<br/>increase in income tax from 20 percent to 25 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  essential  to  recognise  that  MSMEs  are  the  lifeblood  of  our  economy.    They  drive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>innovation, create opportunities and contribute significantly to our GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  this  Budget  passes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  be  breaking  Fiji’s  backbone  and  the 
<br/>consequences will plague us for decade.  How can a man claiming to be an economic professor not 
<br/>serious?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rural community will be the most affected by the Budget increase.  </span><span>O 
<br/>au kai veikau,</span><span>Mr. Speaker.  They are already struggling to afford basic necessities and the increase 
<br/>in VAT will make it even harder for them to make ends meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget for the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 
<br/>shows increase, in fact, transferred from 2022 to 2023 Head 50 and of course from the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture’s  fund.  This  is  not  enough.    The  Government  needs  to  do  more  to  help  the  rural 
<br/>communities such as providing them with the access for affordable food, healthcare and education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister of Finance said that spending money on rural hospitals is a waste of 
<br/>money.  Navosa, I believe.  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if the Coalition Government actually cares 
<br/>about the rural community or are just trying to please their critics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also important to note that the honourable Prime Minister and his Ministers have been 
<br/>travelling the world, going to expensive resorts, enjoying cocktail and posing for a picture in designer 
<br/>dresses. This is while they are asking the people of Fiji to understand the situation and accept the tax 
<br/>increase.    How  dare!    How  dare  they  force  ordinary  Fijians  to  shoulder  the  burden  of  economic 
<br/>recovery while they are enjoying themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  seems  to  be  particularly  enjoying  Tiko’s  Floating 
<br/>Restaurant, while he is making Fijians who are being forced to eat biscuits with tea, pay more for the 
<br/>goods and services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  issue  that  has  ignited  anger  amongst  the  youth  is  broken  promises 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regarding the forgiveness of TELS debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I was not eating the plane, it was you!  I haven’t been to USA and Australia 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the catwalk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Address the Chair, honourable Nath. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- One issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has ignited anger amongst the youth is 
<br/></span><span>the broken promises regarding the forgiveness of TELS debt.  All three Parties in the Coalition has 
<br/></span><span>stated to forgive the debt, but instead convert it into bond.  Let me give the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and his Minister of Finance a quick lesson. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Oxford  Dictionary  defines  the  word  ‘forgive’  as  to  cancel  the  debt.    The  Oxford 
<br/>Dictionary defines the word ‘convert’ is to change into others of a different kind.  It is just to be clear.  
<br/>You did not forgive debt, honourable Gavoka.  As you promised, you never did, you converted it

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>into another form of debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This betrayal of trust has left many young people feeling deceived and let down for many 
<br/>who are already planning to migrate as they are feeling that their future has been taken away.  We 
<br/>warned young people that the TELS promise was not realistic and today. the Coalition has proven us 
<br/>correct.  We warned everyone that the promise  was tricky and today the people of Fiji can see it 
<br/>openly for themselves.  Today, TELS will no longer assist future generation of Fijians in creating 
<br/>better opportunities and many will continue to be trapped in the cycle of poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst has always emphasised on the importance of good infrastructure.  
<br/>However, the honourable Minister of Finance has said that they will do away with the fancy spending.  
<br/>This is a mistake.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we live in Fiji, we need to spend money on proper repair of road, water network, bridges 
<br/>and jetties.  In the past, FijiFirst has spent over $200 million a year on road repairs.  The old water 
<br/>network has also required million dollars of annual spending to keep it under control.  Bridges were 
<br/>needed to be repaired or replaced to ensure the long-term durability for our infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to say that FijiFirst has completed 81 bridges and crossings to-
<br/>date when we were in  power and three nearly in completion which you will be opening  with the 
<br/></span><span>salusalu </span><span>here and there.  When we left office, we had around 30 bridges on design stages, let us see 
<br/>how many they can finish? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these came with the cost, honourable Tabuya, I am not saying, </span><span>dinau.  </span><span>The 2023-2024 
<br/>Budget only included the 8 percent increase in capital expenditure for infrastructure, but 36 percent 
<br/>increase in operating expenditure.  This is a concerning trend and it suggests that the Government is 
<br/>not investing enough in new infrastructure projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our plan was the four-lane road from Nadi to Lautoka, which would have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been fixed next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Forget about it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- That was our game plan. We would have done it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Ro F.Q. Tuisawau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Our game plan was to get this done and followed by the four-lane road 
<br/>from Nadi to Suva.  Let us see the Coalition Government.  It would be worth watching.  Thankfully 
<br/>the Rewa Water Supply and Viria Project is nearly completed, another </span><span>salusalu</span><span>.  This project will 
<br/>solve major water problems in the Central Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  However,  it  is  important  that  the  Government  continues  to  invest  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure projects as this will help to attract investment and create jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  believe  that  the  Government  needs  to  increase  its  investment  in  infrastructure.    This  is 
<br/>essential for a  long-term  economic development  in  Fiji,  Mr. Speaker, but  I do not  know why the 
<br/>honourable Minister cannot see this.  Maybe, the honourable Minister for Infrastructure is weak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government loves to say one thing but do another.  For example, they criticise

<div><span>the Health Sector and claimed that it was in the worst state.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Of course! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yet, they took $9.6 million from the Health Sector in January this year, 
<br/>relocating it away from refurbishing Savusavu Hospital, upgrading Labasa Hospital, construction of 
<br/>new CWM Maternity Unit, buying biomedical equipment and improving infection control.  This was 
<br/>all planned, but that $9.6 million was not used there.  That money would have ensured infrastructure 
<br/>that would last for generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Then they had a great clean up session at CWM Hospital, making sure that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the media was there to take pictures.  What a pretentious move!  Look at it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the alarming rise in crime rate in Fiji is posing a significant threat to our 
<br/>society.    Incidents  such  as  mugging,  robbing,  assault  and  hated  speech,  particularly  targeting  the 
<br/>Indo-Fijian community have created an atmosphere of fear and insecurity.  “Go back to India” is a 
<br/>common phrase now used in </span><span>Facebook.</span><span>  Every community I visited, tells the same story of fear of 
<br/>becoming victims of crime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Standing Order 62, we 
<br/>are  getting  very  close  to  Standing  Order  62  again  Sir.    We  should  keep  away  from  this  kind  of 
<br/>speeches.  It is not helpful for our country, stick to the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It’s the truth! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is not true, it is a nonsense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- All your Members speak outside the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am just raising the Standing Order, </span><span>vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.-  Go back to  India, is  now a common phrase used on  </span><span>Facebook.   </span><span>I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proof, Sir, and I can present it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every community I visit, the story is the same  - the story of fear of becoming a victim of 
<br/>crime.  It is unacceptable that the Fiji Police Force is being unable to effectively address and control 
<br/>this crimes, leading to consequences on our economy and social fabric.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public safety and security  are crucial for fostering a conducive environment for economic 
<br/>growth  and  attractive  investment.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  crime  rate  escalates,  the  citizens  feel 
<br/>unsafe.    It  undermines  the  confidence  and  hampers  the  economic  activity.  This  not  only  affects 
<br/>individual and community but also both domestic and foreign investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  targeting  of  a  specific  community  further  dampens  social  divisions  and  exaggerates 
<br/></span><span>tension.    It  is  disheartening  that  some  members  of  the  Coalition,  including  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation and others, have seen the indifference in this issue and failed to even acknowledge what is 
<br/>happening.  We can show them screenshots of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to urge the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration to prioritise  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  strengthen  the  Police  Force  and  focusing  on  the  core  responsibilities  rather  than  engaging  in 
<br/>activities that do not serve the interest of the public safety, like stalking the former Attorney-General.  
<br/>Such action erodes the reputation of the Police Force and undermines public trust.  We cannot allow 
<br/>our Police Force to become a political tool or be influenced by any political alliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  essential  to  prioritise  the  safety  and  wellbeing  of  all  citizens,  regardless  of  their 
<br/>background, and ensure that the Police Force operates independently and professionally as they were. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition cannot blame anyone now, they have no excuse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget pushes low and middle-income families, it allows the wasteful 
<br/>operation expenditure, normalising inefficient practice instead of prioritising cost effectiveness. This 
<br/>budgetary  division  tampers  the  prospect  of  genuine  economic  growth  and  have  tangible  negative 
<br/>effect on the life of an ordinary Fijian.  It reduces opportunity for a business and individual in the 
<br/>low and medium income bracket to own a home, hindering the ability to build wealth and secure their 
<br/>financial future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people in the West, six months on, are still suffering from the impact of the 
<br/>devastating flood that the Coalition Ministers completely ignored.  Broken promises and overseas 
<br/>trips are the trademark of this Coalition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- This is what they will be remembered for. Even the media who have sold 
<br/>their souls to the Coalition Government cannot keep the people from complaining about them in the 
<br/>social media has exploded with anger at many questionable things that this Government is doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no human being with conscience and even a little bit of kindness will tick 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for this Budget.  I, therefore, reject this Budget, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and good afternoon to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, today during tea break, honourable Usamate promised me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that he will not interject.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  At  least,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  also  have  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition on my side… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- …he is a cane farmer and he wants $100 minimum per tonne of cane... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- …so I said, “You vote for me, I will give it to you”.  I would like to talk 
<br/>about honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu.  He is one of the politicians from the other side, who has put 
<br/>up his hand and wants to give more land from his Ra Province to grow more sugarcane.  I like that 
<br/>kind of approach.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1245 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before, I go on to my speech proper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need to give some observations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Naivalurua  said  something  about  FICAC  and  that it  should  stay,  but  I  do  not 
<br/>know what is the plan of the honourable Attorney-General, whether FICAC going to be merged or is 
<br/>it going to stand on its own.  But one thing for sure, I would like to say that the person who is currently 
<br/>the CEO of FICAC  – Mr. Rashmi  Aslam,  has to go immediately because three years ago, Abdul 
<br/>Khan, the former CEO of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), his corrupt file was handed to FICAC and 
<br/>to-date, nothing has happened.  Here, we have small cases that were given to FICAC, immediately 
<br/>people were prosecuted and sent to jail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, I will talk about the sugar industry and the plans we have, but 
<br/>one  thing  I  want  to  remind  honourable  Members  in  this  Parliament  about  is  that  FSC  employed 
<br/>Vishnu Mohan as the Chairman, who was residing in Toronto.  He was running FSC remotely.  In 
<br/>here, Abdul Khan made the CEO and was paid $840,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Now, listen!  The truth hurts.  Sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He has raised a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What’s your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am requesting the honourable Member not to point at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  before  I  finish,  do  not  enter  into  any  kind  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussion.  No running comment, honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Abdul Khan was paid $840,000 salary, his total package was over a million 
<br/>dollars. Here, FSC was going down, and that type of salary was agreed by the previous Government 
<br/>and the Minister for Sugar who was the former Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When Mr. Khan left, then there was Graham Clark, who was on package of $750,000.  Also, 
<br/>when he left, there was Navin Chandra and he was on a package of $500,000.  Today, we have a 
<br/>CEO, Bhan Pratap Singh, who is on a package of $200,000 and he is doing a much better job than 
<br/>anyone else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is another observation I want to make.  The honourable Opposition 
<br/>Members keep referring to us as a three-Party Coalition or three-legged stool.  Now, I remember very 
<br/>well soon after the Election, the FijiFirst Executives went running to Mr. Saneem - the second legged 
<br/></span><span>stool and no stools can stand on two legs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here, they thought that the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is a small kid 
<br/>where they can dangle a carrot in front of him and throw some lollies too.  But little did they realise 
<br/>that he is much more intelligent than the honourable Members on the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So today. the Coalition Party is intact, solid, we are here for four years and beyond to 2014.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  sugar  industry  is  falling  apart,  I  was 
<br/>commented  from  the  other  side  that  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  made  a  wrong  mistake  by 
<br/>appointing myself as the Minister of Sugar.  In fact, the whole Fiji knows that I am a very successful 
<br/>businessman, I am a successful farmer and this combination is the best combination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Take that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as soon as we came into Government, I collected all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders of FSC, I invited Mr. Hari Punja to our office… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just talk on the Budget! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- …a businessman who has got a lot of experience.  I want him to have an 
<br/>input on how to go about in the sugar industry.  One thing I tell you honourable Usamate, Hari Punja 
<br/>had advised FSC some 20 years ago that FSC should have a refinery.  If they had listened to him 
<br/>then, the state of FSC would not have been what it is today because the whole world where the sugar 
<br/>industry is, they all have refineries together – attached to it, they have co-generation and they have 
<br/>an ethanol plant, and that makes money.  Anyway, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  20 years ago, it was just …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Well, that is the same thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Figures do not lie, Mr. Speaker.  In 2006, the industry was thriving.  It had 3.2 million tonnes 
<br/>of  cane  and  that  was  under  the  Qarase  Government.    In  2006,  soon  after  the  takeover,  the  sugar 
<br/>industry declined in its production and today, it stands at 1.6 million tonnes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Why was that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Well, the Minister was sleeping on the job.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, having 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Now, he is saying that to the former Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He’s the Minister for Sugar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to start by commending the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for preparing a sophisticated but a clear and well 
<br/>thought-out  Budget  within  a  short  time  since  assuming  the  office.    His  dedication,  expertise  and 
<br/>leadership has been instrumental in drafting a comprehensive Budget that addresses the critical and 
<br/>immediate needs of our nation, probably the the finest Budget that we have seen in a number of years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budget  aligns  with  the  Coalition  Government’s  vision,  addressing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carefully … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  It is good that you are on track again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- The Budget aligns with the Coalition Government’s vision, addressing

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1247 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carefully  the  socio-economic  challenges  and  promotes  sustainable  development.    The  level  of 
<br/>detailed clarity and strategic thinking is evident in the proposed Budget that demonstrates his depth 
<br/>of understanding our nation’s financial landscape and his commitment to ensuring its prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  want  to  place  on  record,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  appreciation  to  the  Fiscal  Review 
<br/>Committee  and  its  Chairman,  Mr.  Richard  Naidu,  for  leading  the  discussions  and  allowing 
<br/>contribution from each and every one that made efforts to get their views heard, and not forgetting 
<br/>all business houses, professionals, economists and everyone that wanted his views.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government has finally delivered a Budget that was much needed.  And I can assure you 
<br/>that we all will make every effort to ensure that every dollar is well spent on the expected outcomes 
<br/>and not spent lavishly like in the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  did  was  remarkable  indeed.  
<br/>However, it would not have been possible without the ever present support of our humble and most 
<br/>gracious Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  express  my  deepest  gratitude  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>visionary  leadership  and  steadfast  commitment  to  the  welfare  of  our  beautiful  nation.    Under  his 
<br/>guidance, our Government has embarked on a transformative journey, prioritising economic growth, 
<br/>social development and sustainable progress.  His guidance and support have been instrumental in 
<br/>shaping the direction of this Budget and ensuring its alignment with our national priorities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to each and every Cabinet Minister and 
<br/>Assistant Minister, including their Ministry staff for their tireless efforts, dedication and expertise in 
<br/>their respective domains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister of Finance has mentioned in the Budget Address, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“You can only move forward if you have thoroughly examined the past and learn 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our predecessors had more than 15 years to right the perceived wrongs of the Government 
<br/>before that if they are so honest too, and I speak specifically on the sugar industry.  They had 15 
<br/>years, and I must stress, 15 years to formulate an Act in the sugar industry, to give the industry a 
<br/>cutting edge, to bring about sweeping changes and give the farmers what they deserve.  Yet, they 
<br/>failed and I must stress, they failed miserably.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They stood here in this august Parliament and proudly bragged about the economic boom and 
<br/>unprecedented growth in the past decade while our people suffered because of their ignorance.  Since 
<br/>I became the Minister, the sugarcane farmers have been asking me, where is the economic boom and 
<br/>why were they not part of this boom?  I told them, “While we cannot change what has happened in 
<br/>the past, but we promise you that this Government will work for the people, with you and for the 
<br/>industry.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now speak on the budget provided to the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic 
<br/></span><span>Affairs and Sugar Industry for the 2023-2024 financial year.  The Ministry has been allocated $51.7 
<br/>million in the new financial year, of which, $49.7 million is for the sugar industry and $2 million is 
<br/>for the Mult-Ethnic Affairs.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  Budget  reflects  our  commitment  to  revitalise  and  hence  the  sugar  industry 
<br/>which has a vital role in our economy, providing employment opportunities, contributing to rural 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development and generating foreign exchange earnings.  It has been carefully crafted after extensive 
<br/>consultation with the industry experts, stakeholders, representatives from cane growers, millers and 
<br/>other related sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  previously,  the  farmers  had  one  voice  and  the  only  voice  in  the  sugar 
<br/>industry was the Sugar Cane Growers Council, where farmers representatives could have made their 
<br/>voices heard, which was taken away from them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have promised that we will bring back the farmers’ voice in the sugar industry, we will 
<br/>give them the platform to air their grievances, we will support them, and we will listen to them as 
<br/>people’s Government.  I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that the budgetary allocation of 
<br/>$187,000 has been provided to hold the Sugar Cane Growers Council Election, which gives back 
<br/>farmers  a  voice  in  the  affairs  of  the  sugar  industry.    The  allocation  for  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers 
<br/>Council will give back power to  the farmers to  choose their representative.  Let  us face the fact- 
<br/>without farmers, there is no sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us shed some light on the situation of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC).  The 
<br/>FSC has been experiencing extremely financial distress attributed to climate change, volatility in raw 
<br/>sugar price, milling efficiencies and decline in cane production.  This has been further exacerbated 
<br/>by the ignorance of the previous Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the current financial year, FSC is looking at making a profit of $18 million at EBITDA, 
<br/>meaning Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation.  However, once we factor 
<br/>that FSC has to pay the legacy debt, the profit turns into a loss because of the historical debts of past 
<br/>decades under the past Governments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are able to resolve the legacy debt issue for FSC.  Therefore, 
<br/>if we are able to resolve the legacy debt issue at FSC, we should see a turnaround at FSC as well, as 
<br/>the sugar industry as whole, and we forecast a profit more than $30 million at EBITDA for the next 
<br/>financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I want to inform this august Parliament that the Government did 
<br/>not contribute any money for the top-up of cane payment for the last season, and we see a similar 
<br/>positive trend for this season as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our predecessors had promised $85 guaranteed cane price for the past four 
<br/>years.  Our hardworking farmers did not reap the benefit that was promised, they were short changed.  
<br/>Since we have come into Government, we are breaking every effort to correct the errors of the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2022 crop, farmers have already received $85.26, and I am pleased to state that there 
<br/>is  still  one more final  cane payment to  come.  We are pleased to  announce that $85 a tonne will 
<br/>continue with this Government, and I can state now that our Government will not short change the 
<br/>farmers anymore.  They will receive what they rightfully should have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, as I have added, Mr. Speaker, the world cane price in this coming season, has gone up 
<br/></span><span>and hopefully, if not $95, at least up to $90 and this is based on the Master Award because we have 
<br/></span><span>a 70:30 formula of sharing.  So, the more the price we get after selling our sugar, the more the farmers 
<br/>will get.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the industry has received an allocation of $150,000 under the Sugar Industry 
<br/>Strategic Development Plan which will allow all the stakeholders, including farmers, to contribute to 
<br/>the development of a strategic plan to revitalize the industry.  The objective, as we see, will be to  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>significantly increase cane production, to tap into the markets not explored before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to be able to venture into other markets, such as packing and refinery, to produce 
<br/>white sugar, ethanol and core generation, which will provide some needed value addition and provide 
<br/>high returns to our hardworking farmers. To do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to invest in new mills 
<br/>that will help us achieve these goals.  Sir, these mills can cost up to $100 million, all depending on 
<br/>what size of mill we would like to have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, recently on our trip to Mauritius, we have seen that we do not really have to go into 
<br/>making sugar.  If we want to make ethanol, we can go straight from sugar juice into making ethanol.  
<br/>So, we are planning that if we are to set up our ethanol plant, hopefully in Rakiraki, then we would 
<br/>like to have this type of small mills which are more efficient and it will run 24/7, 365 days a year and 
<br/>based on the balance of the time, we will use molasses out of Ba and Lautoka mill to make ethanol. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, those are the plans.  There was a comment made that there is no allocation in the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Actually, there is a feasibility study being done and this is a mill that we have to have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Look, we will do it within four years.  Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we are able to realise our dreams of the new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mills, the sophisticated sugar products we need to significantly increase sale.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry has provided a budget of $5 million for the sugarcane development and 
<br/>farmers assistance. This is an increase of $4 million from 2022 to 2023 financial year.  The Ministry 
<br/>aims to increase cane production from its current production of 1.6 million to around 2 million tonnes 
<br/>by 2024 season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  target  of  2  million  tonnes  could  be  achieved  by  bringing  underutilised  land  and 
<br/>production replacing uneconomical ratoons, improving adoption of new technologies, promoting best 
<br/>husbandry practice and improving the soil health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all over the world, the application of fertilizer has been crucial in ensuring 
<br/>good  crop  production  which  include  sugar  cane.    Fertilizers  provide  essential  nutrients  that  are 
<br/>necessary for the healthy growth and development of sugarcane plants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper fertilization can significantly increase cane production. To ensure that the fertilizer 
<br/>application is  not  compromised, the government  will continue to  subsidize fertilizer price  for the 
<br/>sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry has been allocated $20 million to continue the subsidy up to 65.90 for 
<br/>every  bag  of  fertilizer  that  sugarcane  farmers  will  purchase.    This  means,  sugarcane  famers  will 
<br/></span><span>continue to pay only $20 per bag.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry has been facing various challenges, including emerging 
<br/>impacts of climate change.  Frequent raining and flooding due to climate change has been one of the 
<br/>major problems for the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drainage system in the sugar cane areas have been neglected for years or there had been 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>negligible maintenance in the last several years.  Consequently, there has been a significant reduction 
<br/>in cane production in the low-lying areas due to frequent flooding and seawater intrusion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 6,550 growers are facing issues with infield or main drain blockage which equates 
<br/>to nearly 60 percent of the total active sugarcane growers in Fiji.  The drainage system comprising 
<br/>of infield and main drains, culverts and floodgates, need to be repaired or changed to enable farmers 
<br/>to cultivate cane adequately with good yield potential.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budget support of $5.5 million provided will mitigate the effects of the poor drainage and 
<br/>increase the cane production and its productivity for the next crushing season.  By inviting plant 
<br/>growth maybe some sugar contents and in pending harvest operations. The government has allocated 
<br/>weedicides subsidy of $1 million which is an increase of $400,000 in the previous year.  The subsidy 
<br/>will assist sugarcane farmers, afford effective weed control measures, ensuring that the crops that are 
<br/>not overshadowed by invasive weeds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  ensure  the  viability  of  the  sugar  industry,  the  Ministry  should  take 
<br/>measures to attract new farmers while at the same time maintaining those good farmers by providing 
<br/>some relief for the renewal of lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  providing  a  budget  of  $2  million  for  new  farmers  and  lease  premium  assistance,  the 
<br/>Government has ensured that much needed relief is provided to farmers who want to invest in the 
<br/>sugar industry but have financial barriers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By encouraging new farmers to enter the industry, it helps to ensure a continuous supply of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sugarcane and promotes the growth of the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Rakiraki Mill has been closed by the previous Government, we 
<br/>have  no  alternative  but  to  continue  with  the  cane  cartage  programme.  The  programme  provides 
<br/>transportation,  especially  by  ensuring  farmers  not  to  be  burdened  with  the  excessive  cost  of 
<br/>transporting the cane from the Penanag Mill area to Rarawai Mill.  The programme will continue 
<br/>with a budget of $4,900,000 which will allow the Penang Mill farmers to transport 1300 tonnes of 
<br/>canes to the Rarawai Mill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of producing cane has increased significantly over the years and 
<br/>the growers are relying on Government subsidies sustainably.  Whilst the Government has guaranteed 
<br/>the price of $85, the profit margin has diluted largely because of the transportation cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The growers near the Mills are able to absorb the increase, those located on the outer areas 
<br/>are not able to sustain themselves and are slowing leaving the industry.  Mechanically harvested cane 
<br/>are allowed to be brought to the Mills by rail mode of transportation which is the cheapest mode of 
<br/>transportation for sugarcane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, there are 60 cane bins that have been used in Lautoka Mill which has been a success 
<br/>story  in  easing  the  transportation  issues  for  farmers.    The  budget  of  $1  million  provided  in  this 
<br/>financial year, the cage bins will ensure that FSC is able to introduce a further 50 cage bins which 
<br/></span><span>will further ease transportation issues for the growers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are we rounding off, honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is something to be said about multi-ethnic, but I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leave it to some other day.  Thank you very much for listening to me, honourable Members.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1251 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  TUICOLO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies 
<br/>and gentlemen; I rise to briefly contribute to the Debate of the 2023-2024 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics for his Budget Address, although I do not agree with the content 
<br/>of the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a politician once said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We are looking for a vision in this Budget, something to spark the imagination of 
<br/>the people.  A clear vision of a worthwhile future that stretches beyond what we have in 
<br/>this country today.  This Budget and this government has gone into what we could call a 
<br/>“brain glitch” because they cannot truly see the basis of the future of this country.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He went on to say and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There is great room for improvement by this government to display magnanimity 
<br/>after winning the Elections.  Unfortunately, it continues with its egoistic “know it all” 
<br/>and vindictive attitude, and has presented a Budget which, in the medium to long term, 
<br/>is going to make our future even bleaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a Budget which is going to increase the gap between the rich and the poor and 
<br/>also  on  that,  it  is  going  to  increase  some  inequality,  continuing  with  previous  tax 
<br/>policies, such as the increase in VAT and reduction in income and corporate tax”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Biman Prasad, 2014 Budget Response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023-2024 National Budget lacks vision and compassion 
<br/>for citizens, and that is exactly how the people, after the Budget presentation, sum up their feelings 
<br/>about this Budget and the Coalition Government that forms the basis of my opposition to this Budget 
<br/>in this debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  express  my  sincere  gratitude  and  heartfelt  thanks  to  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and my fellow members who have spoken before me for their 
<br/>Budget response.  I fully agree and wholeheartedly endorse the content and their Budget response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, youth are the biggest hope for the future and Fiji is now 
<br/>a nation of youth with 70 percent of the Fijian population under the age of 40.  It is, therefore, very 
<br/>surprising  that  no  new  policies  and  programmes  are  youth-oriented  to  attract  their  attention  and 
<br/>support or focusing on youth empowerment and inclusiveness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is deceiving, misleading and discriminatory in nature towards 
<br/>our  Fijian  youth.    There  was  so  much  harp  on  public  consultation  from  Opposition  Parties  when 
<br/>FijiFirst  was  in  Government.    According  to  honourable  Prasad,  they  believe  in  consultations, 
<br/></span><span>dialogue  and  making  sure  that  people  are  free  to  engage  and  raise  issues  with  the  Government, 
<br/></span><span>Ministers and everyone else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance further on mentioned that the Budget is 
<br/>an outcome of the numerous consultations and dialogue he had with diverse groups of stakeholders 
<br/>across Fiji.  According to him, they talked with various industry groups, the private sector, businesses 
<br/>and entrepreneurs.  The question that we all ask are, who exactly did they consult?  Which youth or 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>women group would suggest and increase in VAT and other indirect taxes?  Which student would 
<br/>suggest  converting  the  debt  into  bond?    Which  youth  group  would  suggest  a  decrease  in  the  Fiji 
<br/>Sports Council allocation so that youth would pay more to access sporting facilities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems that the consultation is between him and his cohorts.  Therefore, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urge the honourable Minister to exercise some wisdom and refrain from misleading the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance, in his Budget Address, said that he had 
<br/>a one-on-one consultation on the Budget with the Coalition Cabinet Ministers.  The outcome of the 
<br/>one-on-one consultation with the Minister for Youth and Sports is a slashed allocation for the Fiji 
<br/>Sports Council under Head 25.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the news article published by </span><span>Fiji Live</span><span> on July 3</span><span>rd</span><span>, 2023, the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Youth and Sports is worried about the slashed allocation for the Fiji Sports Council.  The youth 
<br/>are worried and we are worried that the reduction in the Fiji Sports Council allocation might result 
<br/>in an increase in their rates.  Running the facilities is very costly, therefore, the decrease in allocation 
<br/>would affect the general operation of the Fiji Sports Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance will not be worried because he 
<br/>hardly  uses  these  facilities.    According  to  honourable  Biman’s  Budget  response  on  Revenue  and 
<br/>Expenditure Policy in 2014, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If we analyse the revenue and expenditure policy between 2009 and 2013, we 
<br/>find that the Government has increasingly relied on indirect taxes, which the people do 
<br/>not know that they have to pay.  That is why it is easier for Government to always go for 
<br/>the indirect taxes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  In  2011,  Government  increased  VAT  to  15  percent.    That  is  a  regressive  tax  and  the 
<br/>burden of this falls more heavily on the poor.  In addition, from 2010, Government also 
<br/>increased fees, fines and charges which are, again, a huge burden on the everyday person 
<br/>in this country.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is exactly what is on the Budget today.  We noted that the increasing 
<br/>figures, in particular, the estimated revenue from indirect taxes is simply because of the changes to 
<br/>the Value Added Tax (VAT) Structure from 9 percent to 15 percent, Departure Tax increasing from 
<br/>$100 to $125, increase in excise duty, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increase  in  the  estimated  Direct  Taxes  amount  is  the  result  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase of Corporate Tax rates from 20 percent to 25 percent, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, according to the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) Leader during 
<br/>the  launch  of  the  SODELPA’s  2022  Manifesto  on  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  September,  2022,  the  Party  believes  in 
<br/>removing  the  burden  of  student  loans  and  providing  free  education  up  to  first  degree  level.    The 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister fails to inform the youth of Fiji that TELS debt forgiveness comes 
<br/>with a condition, that is, debt is converted to bond. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the current scenario, on the right hand, one Coalition partner lets go 
<br/>the hand of the student saying, “Your debt has been forgiven”.  On the other hand, the other Coalition 
<br/>partner is holding it tight and telling the student, “You are not going anywhere unless you serve your 
<br/>bond or pay your debt”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further on the TSLS’s CEO, Mr. Lal, stated on the </span><span>Fiji Live</span><span> news on 2</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>July,  2023  that  student  loans  will  not  be  forgiven  for  those  who  are  in  overseas  and  have  made 
<br/>arrangements with FRCS on repayment.  This is totally unfair on our youth, who are now in overseas 
<br/>for employment or studies.  What happens to those who are not interested in getting employed here 
<br/>locally?  How will they serve their bond?  Will they be forced to pay their debt? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what will happen to those youth who now have their debts forgiven and will 
<br/>find employment under the Pacific Australian Labour Mobility Scheme (PALMS) in future?  Will 
<br/>the  Government  demand  our  youth  to  pay  upfront  before  departing  our  shores,  or  will  they  be 
<br/>required to serve their bond term before they can be allowed to participate in the Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  decision  to  convert  the  debt  into  bond  is  very  much  deceiving, 
<br/>misleading and discriminatory in nature for our youth.   The Inflation Mitigation Measures announced 
<br/>in the 2022-2023 National Budget should have been one of the initiative, incorporated in the 2023-
<br/>2024  Budget.    The  initiative  reflects  compassion  and  care  for  every  Fijian,  especially  our  most 
<br/>vulnerable Fijians.  It could have relieved the most vulnerable from the rising prices of goods, with 
<br/>the re-introduction of the 15 percent VAT. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  Coalition  Government  had  continued  with  the  $180  Inflation 
<br/>Mitigation  Allowance,  a  social  pensioner  above  the  age  of  65  currently  receiving  $100  monthly 
<br/>allowance would receive an additional $360 per annum, compared to the new rate and increase by 
<br/>$15, whereby the recipient will only receive an additional of $180 per annum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a social pensioner above the age of 70 currently receiving $100 monthly 
<br/>allowance would receive an additional $360 per annum, compared to the new rate, an increase by 
<br/>$25 whereby the recipient will only receive an additional $300 per annum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a person with disability currently receiving $90 monthly allowance would 
<br/>receive an additional $360 per annum, compared to the new rate and increase by $14 whereby the 
<br/>recipient would only receive an additional $168 per annum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, a parent would receive $360 per annum per child - $100 more should 
<br/>the Inflation Mitigation Support System Scheme continues, compared to the Back-to-School Support 
<br/>of $200 per child per annum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the honourable Minister of Finance will try to find cost-
<br/>cutting measure to control the Budget deficit, but at the same time, we must not deceive our fellow 
<br/>Fijians at any cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  while  still  on  the  Back-to-School  Support,  I  would  like  to  share  the  type  of 
<br/>question asked by many school parents nowadays in regards to the Back-to-School Support, and I 
<br/>would like to ask the two honourable </span><span>Bulous </span><span>and </span><span>Adi </span><span>from the Government side to translate it for us.  
<br/></span><span>Tako, ni gica madji na qulu khe na rua na drau na dola?  Madu tei wale boto na wacia</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>meaning 
<br/>when are we receiving the $200? We might wait forever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people have the idea that whenever a new initiative is announced during the 
<br/></span><span>Budget Address, they expect it to be implemented soon afterwards.  This is not the case for the Back-
<br/></span><span>to-School  Support.    The  announcement  was  sugar-coated,  making  people  believe  that  it  is  a  new 
<br/>initiative.    Young  parents  had  high  hopes  in  receiving  the  assistance,  only  to  find  out  that  it  has 
<br/>already been given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we thank the Coalition Government for grants allocated to Head 26, the 
<br/>Higher Education Institutions.  Surprisingly, Pacific Polytechnic Limited, a new institution unknown 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to many Fijians, appears to be allocated a grant of $1 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a few other institutions have been in operation and in existence for some time, 
<br/>namely  ServicePro  International  Tourism  Hospitality  Institute,  Prestige  Caregiving  Fiji,  and  few 
<br/>others.  Neither one of them have been allocated grants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the SODELPA Leader during the launch of the SODELPA’s 
<br/>2022  Manifesto  on  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  September,  2022,  said  that  the  SODELPA  Budget  allocation  for  tertiary 
<br/>institutions would result in an increased grant for all existing tertiary institutions including three new 
<br/>institutions namely Technical College of Fiji, ServicePro and Tagitagi Sangam Technical College.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is, why are they not allocated grants? These institutions have been in 
<br/>existence for some time and are all in full operation.  Is it because ServicePro and Prestige Caregiving 
<br/>Fiji both are offering short courses and mainly targeting women and girls? All these institutions enrol 
<br/>our  Fijian  youths  and  any  form  of  discrimination  based  on  gender,  race,  ethnicity  and  religious 
<br/>background should not be allowed to affect the empowerment of our youths.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we  are not  the type of Opposition  that raises a Point of Order against  a 
<br/>fellow member for expressing his views in supporting certain initiatives outlined in the Budget.  And 
<br/>with  that  being  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  grateful  and  commend  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance  and  the  Coalition  Government  for  continuing  with  initiatives  introduced  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, as it is there for a purpose and that is not to divide us but enhance the lives of our fellow 
<br/>Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  commend  the  increase  in  grant  of  $9.7  million  allocated  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>National Sports Commission even though it was less than the amount they initially requested. With 
<br/>the increase in allocation, this will enhance sports developments for our youths and communities and 
<br/>it should also allow the welfare of our players to be taken care of in a fair and just manner.  Contracts 
<br/>and agreements must be honoured to avoid any repetition of any sort of breaches experienced by our 
<br/>national players. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific Games is a continental multi-sport event held every four years 
<br/>among athletes from Oceania.  I thank the honourable Minister of Youth and Sports for declaring 
<br/>their support and making sure that all our youths will participate in the meet. These are our youths, 
<br/>and all have individually sacrificed their time and resources to prepare themselves for the games.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many of these youths are unemployed and with Government assistance, it is very 
<br/>much commendable and appreciated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  welcome  the  increase  of  funding  allocated  to  the  Young 
<br/>Entrepreneurship  Scheme  in  Head  34.    With  the  increase  in  allocation,  it  will  enhance  the 
<br/>development of more young business entrepreneurs in which it will continue to promote and harness 
<br/>the talents of young Fijians to become job creators rather than just be job seekers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the increase in the construction of hard courts allocation under Head 
<br/>25,  we  are  grateful,  and  we  hope  that  it  will  be  utilised  according  to  its  purpose,  enhance  sports 
<br/>development amongst our youth and address the rise of NCD-related diseases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we welcome the increase in grant of $103,250 for Persons with Disabilities.  
<br/>That will continue to empower these individuals through sports programmes and leaving no Fijian 
<br/>behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Navosa will be always forever thankful of the 
<br/>major infrastructure development in Navosa by the FijiFirst Government namely the Navosa Sub-
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1255 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>divisional Hospital, the two -lane Namatewale Super Bridge and the rural electrification programme.  
<br/>Please excuse me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I am using Navosa as a model of infrastructural development 
<br/>need as I am more familiar with the area more than other province in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first let me comment briefly about the Navosa Suv-divisional Hospital at 
<br/>Navatumali, Keiyasi. It is the pride of Navosa, although there is a lot said about it but people are 
<br/>ignorant about the sheer size of Navosa and its physical relief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost the entire population of inland Navosa are born in Sigatoka, some 
<br/>close to 100 miles away from home. To think about that every pregnant mother in Navosa has to plan 
<br/>with the husband where to find a hostel or friendly home near Sigatoka during the pre-and post-natal 
<br/>period which may last two to three months is simply unthinkable.  It is a daunting and inevitable task 
<br/>to find a home to cater for the family during the duration of their stay. Some of these women have to 
<br/>walk or on horseback or raft to find transport down to Sigatoka Hospital.  This is not to mention the 
<br/>difficulty  in  transporting  the  terminally  ill  patient  and  transportation  of  corpse  to  be  taken  to  the 
<br/>mortuary.  I  hope  that  this  solemn  thought  is  worth  thinking  about  before  the  mouth is  opened  to 
<br/>criticise  the  extravagance  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  in  building  a  hospital  for  one  of  the  last 
<br/>developed province of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sensible thing to reduce drug cultivation in the area is to bring to their 
<br/>door urban environment that will meet their aspiration as rural dwellers.  The rural dwellers especially 
<br/>in Navosa know fully well the economic disparity the exist between the urban and rural living. The 
<br/>FijiFirst Government was well aware of this.  That was an attempt to show the people that money 
<br/>was of less importance when it comes to the wellbeing to deprived people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a two-lane super bridge that had been the solution to the biggest obstacle in 
<br/>travelling in wet months in that part of the country, now standing serene and absolutely magnificent, 
<br/>which not only solve the flooding problem but was poised as part of the inland highway that was to 
<br/>materialise in a couple of years’ time has now been forgotten by government which so far has almost 
<br/>dropped infrastructure development as far as roading is concerned in Navosa.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>only  thing  we  can  say  now  is  “</span><span>Isa  Oilei  o  Navosa</span><span>”.    The  hope  of  progressive  development 
<br/>infrastructure nullified, you have to wait for PWD to be fully resurrected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today as I speak, the rural electrification has reached Korolevu Village in 
<br/>the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Noikoro.  We thank the Coalition Government for the continuation of the electrification 
<br/>projects. Villages, settlements and individual farmhouse have been connected with electricity along 
<br/>the Sigatoka River Valley and the other villages of Nubuyanitu, Draubuta and Nakoro on the Nasa 
<br/>River, a tributary of the Sigatoka River, they are completely or designed to be fully solarised like 
<br/>Nakoro Village.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most important infrastructural development is taking place in the upper 
<br/>Navosa Province. The biggest infrastructural demand is the development of the highway from Narata 
<br/>Village where the tarseal road ends to Keiyasi Village some 30 kilometres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget session if this Government gives some thought about the well-
<br/></span><span>being of the people of Navosa by completing the highway and thereby, resolve the last and greatest 
<br/></span><span>infrastructural demand in Navosa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, should I have a mandate, I would request the Government not to undertake 
<br/>any development in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Naqalimare, Davutukia, Namataku, Nasikawa and Noikoro but to 
<br/>complete the above highway from Narata to Keiyasi in their term made available to them. We will 
<br/>have been satisfied and immensely gratified.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, the Budget lacks vision and compassion for our citizens, therefore 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will not support it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers  and  honourable 
<br/>Members.      I  support  the  Budget  of  the  Coalition  Government  presented  by  our  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister,  Minister  of  Finance.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  rightly  stated  by  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance, we find ourselves in the midst of an immensely challenging situation.  Fiji bears the weight 
<br/>of a burdensome debt level, a consequence of previous government decisions and policies that have 
<br/>fallen short of their intended outcomes and promises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  likened  to  witnessing  a  boxer  trapped  against  the  ropes,  enduring 
<br/>relentless  blows  one  after  another.    Yet,  I  assure  each  and  every  one  of  you  that  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government possesses the resilience and expertise necessary to navigate through such treacherous 
<br/>blows.  We are steadfast in our commitment under the leadership of our very able honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister to ensure fiscal responsibility, reducing our debt and propelling Fiji towards a future that is 
<br/>robust and prosperous for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget signifies the beginning of our journey as a nation, working together to achieve 
<br/>our shared goals while embodies our unwavering commitment to look out for one another and mostly 
<br/>our vulnerable individuals, reflecting the core of our Fijian values. Yes, Fiji we have been absolutely 
<br/>honest and upfront with you. You and I will pay more VAT, but it is not for this Government, it is 
<br/>not for this side of Parliament. One quarter of the budget, $1 billion is to pay back the huge debt left 
<br/>behind by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  It is to take care of our people who need it the most, our poorest, our 
<br/>10 percent of people living in poverty that the FijiFirst Government failed to take better care of.  They 
<br/>took care of the middle income, the higher income, the one-percenters of this country, but they forgot 
<br/>the bottom 10 percent of this country living in poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We have not just increased the VAT outright without any benefit.  
<br/>The benefit to our middle-income earners is that your children do not have to carry the debt burden 
<br/>of TELS.  Your children and grandchildren do not have to carry the massive FijiFirst national debt 
<br/>in their future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So who will pay? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We are paying it for it now, we are paying it, we are not borrowing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more of </span><span>dinau</span><span> (debt) to pay for it.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in VAT now sees the priorities being put in the right place.  We 
<br/>have prioritised your health with the increase in budget of almost $70 million.  We have prioritised 
<br/>our women, our children, our elderly and our disabled with the increase in the budget of $52 million.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We have prioritised infrastructure with an increase in budget of $62 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million.   
<br/>We are prioritising your children’s education with an increase in budget of a whopping $184 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- So yes, the returns on paying VAT will be these increases in essential 
<br/>services that will benefit you and your families, and they do not understand that simple matter.   They 
<br/>just speak on the increase in VAT, they did not talk about the benefits that are coming.   This is what 
<br/>balance means, this is a well-balanced Budget.  We can take care of our problems, we can live within 
<br/>our means, we can practice self-reliance, we can take back our dignity and have some integrity in 
<br/>restoring our personal and national ability to look out for each other, to take care of each other, to 
<br/>build our nation from within, not keep running to the bank because we want to just buy and buy and 
<br/>buy and have an unlimited appetite to be extravagant and live outside our means and </span><span>dinau</span><span>,</span><span> dinau 
<br/>dinau</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- This extravagant lifestyle has trickled down to our people.  We hear 
<br/>of our people who live well over three or four times the minimum wage, living in squatter settlements 
<br/>and they </span><span>dinau</span><span> from the market vendors and canteens and they are struggling to pay back this </span><span>dinau</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- So the </span><span>dinau</span><span> and living beyond our means mentality is now deeply 
<br/>entrenched.  We need to move our people back to self-reliance and addressing poverty is and always 
<br/>has been an effective and efficient way of managing our resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why I am excited about the vast increase in budget for the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affair.  Why? Because it shows our commitment also to address poverty amongst </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>which showed in the statistics, the ethnic data which does not lie that our people living under poverty, 
<br/>75  percent  are  </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>    We  need  to  move  our  people  from  dependency  and  welfare,  which  they 
<br/>created, to self-reliance.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to highlight the significant increase in the budget allocated to 
<br/>the Ministry for Women, Children and Social Protection.  This substantial rise is particularly focused 
<br/>on three crucial areas.  First and foremost, this is about the Coalition Government’s determination to 
<br/></span><span>leave no room for leaving anyone behind.  We fully understand the challenges they face in meeting 
<br/></span><span>their  basic  needs  and  making  difficult  choices  every  day.    Rest  assured,  they  will  be  supported 
<br/>through  an  increase  in  the  monthly  amount  of  select  social  protection  schemes,  ensuring  greater 
<br/>support for those in need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, I would like to underline that the Budget carries with it a promise to address the 
<br/>national crisis of gender-based violence of two out of three women who face violence and place a 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>specific focus on protecting all women and girls, while aiming to prevent violence against them in 
<br/>all their diversity.  It recognises the urgency and importance of fostering an environment rooted in 
<br/>respect, equality and inclusivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government has made a significant commitment to addressing Gender-Based 
<br/>Violence (GBV) by allocating a total budget of $1 million for the implementation of the National 
<br/>Action Plan (NAP).  At this point in time, I am proud to announce the introduction for the very first 
<br/>time by the Coalition Government  of Gender Responsive Budgeting.  There is an  allocation of a 
<br/>dedicated National Action Plan budget line in this financial year, with the Ministry for Education, 
<br/>Ministry for iTaukei Affairs and Ministry for Youth and Sports and along with the Department of 
<br/>Women.    I  want  to  thank  my  fellow  honourable  colleagues,  the  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro, 
<br/>honourable Ifereimi Vasu and honourable Jese Saukuru for your strong support in gender equality, 
<br/>and there is more to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also taken a significant step forward by establishing the Department of Children by 
<br/>the allocation of adequate resources, emphasising our commitment to  raising  the visibility of our 
<br/>children and safeguarding their well-being  and rights.   In fact,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statistics are 
<br/>more alarming for children - four out of five children in our country face some form of violence.  
<br/>That is a national crisis that we need to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I thank UNICEF for coming on board to provide a Child Advisor to the Ministry 
<br/>to  assist  in  our  strategic  direction.    These  budgetary  commitments  resonate  strongly  and  are 
<br/>fundamental as we prioritise reducing debts and making strategic investments in our people in vital 
<br/>areas such as healthcare, education, social protection and infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  been  allocated  a  budget  of  $200.2  million  in  the  new 
<br/>financial year which is a $52.5 million increase from the previous financial year.  This represents an 
<br/>increase of approximately 35.51 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Starting from 1st August, the Ministry will be renamed as the Ministry of Women, Children 
<br/>and Social Protection.  This change in name is driven by the rationale that poverty is a complex issue 
<br/>that  cannot  be  effectively  addressed  by  a  single  Ministry  alone.    It  is  positive  and  it  requires  a 
<br/>comprehensive,  integrated,  and  coordinated  Whole-of-Government  approach.    Furthermore,  it  is 
<br/>important to note that the majority of the Ministry's efforts and budget are centred around the critical 
<br/>area of social protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has allocated an estimated amount of $169.8 million which 
<br/>is 84 percent of the Ministry’s total budget towards social protection which includes, as you know, 
<br/>the Social Pension Scheme.  With a budget of $78.2 million, it marks an impressive increase in $23 
<br/>million from the last financial year, a 40 percent increase.  We are determined to better support and 
<br/>cater to the needs of our 54,200 senior citizens. I am delighted to announce, of course, in terms of 
<br/>the allocations of 15 percent to 25 percent for our elderly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, we are working with the FNPF to identify and address the grievances of 1,500 
<br/>FNPF pensioners who were unjustly deprived of their financial benefits during that government’s 
<br/></span><span>time in 2011.  We are committed to rectifying this injustice and ensuring these individuals have the 
<br/></span><span>opportunity to access the Government’s Social Pension Allowance, providing them with the rightful 
<br/>financial assistance they need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  have  the  Poverty  Benefit  Scheme  (PBS),  which  is  now  being 
<br/>renamed as the Family Assistance Scheme.  We are expected to benefit a total of 26,000 households 
<br/>to be assisted in this financial year.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Care and Protection Allowance (C&amp;P), we appreciate our guardians who look after our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>children who are in need of care and that is a 15 percent increase in their allowance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Disability  Allowance  Scheme  (DAS),  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition stated yesterday that the reduction of the budget allocation shows a lack of commitment 
<br/>from the Coalition Government to our people living with disabilities.  I wish to clarify that the budget 
<br/>allocation for the National Council for People with Disabilities is largely the same, but the grant to 
<br/>voluntary organisations is reduced, because there has been a low utilisation over the last number of 
<br/>years.  So, the amount is now adjusted to the average that has been spent. The overall funding for 
<br/>disability though has increased by $5.6 million.  This includes the 15 percent increase of allowance 
<br/>that is going directly to our people in need.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bus-fare Subsidy Programme.  This is being allocated $10 million.  In 
<br/>the first quarter of the next financial year, we will transition this assistance from the exclusive bus 
<br/>fare top up card to cash to be paid monthly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a review of the bus fare scheme which we undertook has revealed that the 
<br/>current exclusive mode of transport, the bus, is not serving the needs of our elderly and people with 
<br/>disabilities.  Buses are not disability friendly or wheelchair  accessible, neither are there bus seats 
<br/>exclusively allocated for our people living with disabilities or the elderly. Giving them cash will give 
<br/>them the freedom to either take a taxi or contribute to fuel money within the household or take the 
<br/>bus if they so wish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Food Voucher Programme will now be a direct cash top up to the Family 
<br/>Assistance Programme and the Care &amp; Protection Programme as this will allow beneficiaries to better 
<br/>budget their allowance affording them the freedom to purchase from many supermarkets or shops 
<br/>close to them and they can also access the local market for fresh produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rural Pregnant Mothers Scheme (RPM) which is designed to support 
<br/>our  women  who  are  pregnant  and  mothers  living  in  rural  areas  with  the  objective  of  improving 
<br/>maternal health will continue as practiced with a budgetary allocation of $800,000.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>that is administered by the Ministry of Health who identify the mothers that need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  crucial  for  us  to  acknowledge  the  importance  of  ensuring  the 
<br/>sustainability of our Social Protection Programmes.  We are going through a review of our database.  
<br/>There  are  clients  who  have  been  there  for  many  years.    Social  Protection  Programmes  of  a 
<br/>government is meant only to deal with temporary measures - a loss of employment, natural disasters, 
<br/>a pandemic but  clients  should not  be on the programme for many years.  So, to achieve this Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  we  recognise  the  need  to  gradually  transition  our  recipients  out  of  the  programme, 
<br/>allowing us to extend assistance to other deserving individuals.  With this in mind, we are reviving 
<br/>the Welfare Graduation Programme by allocating $200,000 towards the implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to that end, we are happy to announce that we have begun our graduation 
<br/>programme  with  a  specific  focus  on  our  women.    In  September  this  year  in  partnership  with  the 
<br/>Australian Government  through APTC, scholarships  will be awarded to  young women  who have 
<br/></span><span>recently  turned  18  and  leaving  our  state  homes,  single  women  and  a  few  men  in  the  HART 
<br/></span><span>community  who  are  our  welfare  recipients  who  will  undertake  Engineering  Level  II  Certificate 
<br/>Courses. This is an entry level course, so it does not require any previous experience. We will work 
<br/>to place them upon graduation in Apprenticeships and then secure employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is  just the beginning of the Coalition Government’s commitment to 
<br/>putting our people to work.  We are currently working with the Ministry for Education so that when

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our technical colleges are re-opened, there will be specific allocation of places for our social welfare 
<br/>recipients to be prioritized on scholarships, to be trained and employed, especially our women, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, because the PALM Scheme and the Duavata Scheme, the Seasonal Workers Scheme 
<br/>are taking the majority of our men, but our women are left behind, they are ready to be trained and 
<br/>employed and we will put them to work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to  digitize our database of social  welfare recipients, so  we  can 
<br/>determine our able-bodied men and women who need to graduate from poverty to productivity.  I 
<br/>thank our USP students who are currently on holiday jobs doing data entry for our Ministry for this 
<br/>purpose. So, they are entering data so that we can move towards digitizing our system.  Yes, we are 
<br/>becoming more efficient and more effective in our service delivery and productivity for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has allocated $100,000 for the establishment of the Department 
<br/>for Children who will be responsible to administer the services and programmes aligned to the care 
<br/>and protection of children. For the next financial year, the Department will be equipped with strategic 
<br/>positions for example, the Director for Children, a Principal Officer and other critical positions at 
<br/>HQ  level  who  then  will  be  tasked  with  drafting  proposals  for  Cabinet’s  approval  towards  the 
<br/>establishment of a fully-fledged department at divisional level.  This will be assisted by our Child 
<br/>Advisor who has been provided by UNICEF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin and draw this esteemed Parliament’s attention to some 
<br/>notable developments in gender equality initiatives over the past six months by the Ministry.  You 
<br/>saw  the  launch  of  the  Fiji  Country  Gender  Assessment  under  the  distinguished  presence  of  our 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister which provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of gender 
<br/>equality in our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge this initiative by the FijiFirst Government. However, upon 
<br/>taking over this project, I delayed the launch as I saw that the report was incomplete because it was 
<br/>missing ethnic data.  I insisted that it include ethnic data, data that was kept from the public by the 
<br/>previous government and the data that was much demonised then is rightly out of hiding and rightly 
<br/>made available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against All Women and Girls was also 
<br/>launched as I stated earlier with the support from Gender Responsive Budgeting from our Ministers.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have put together an advisory forum to kick start the development of the 
<br/>Fiji Women's Economic Empowerment National Action Plan and we hope to launch this next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have several initiatives from the Ministry in the Department of Women 
<br/>but  I  am  happy  to  confirm  that  the  Department  for  Women  has  been  allocated  a  budget  of  $5.2 
<br/>million, an increase of $1 million.  It shows the commitment from the Government towards gender 
<br/>equality.  Furthermore, the Department will be able to enhance its efforts in carrying out the National 
<br/>Action Plans and initiatives aimed at achieving gender equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are continuing, of course, with a budget of $200,000 for the National 
<br/>Domestic  Helpline  (1560)  as  well  as  the  support  towards  our  National  Women’s  Expo.  We  have 
<br/></span><span>increased it from $500,000 to $600,000 this year.  We have also allocated $100,000 for the Women 
<br/></span><span>Economic  Empowerment  Scheme.  It  usually  identifies  our  Women  Entrepreneurs  (WE)  who  are 
<br/>aspiring to expand their businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  quickly  explain  about  the  issue  of  the  Barefoot  College 
<br/>Project.  Barefoot College International had taken over and were to operate the Barefoot College in 
<br/>Vanua Levu.  The Ministry has received this budget allocation of $1 million to complete the building.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a High Court decision in India has ruled that Barefoot College 
<br/>International cannot operate under the current logo and so it has to change its registration and logo 
<br/>in order to operate.    So, it has forced us to relook at this initiative by the previous government and 
<br/>explore  options  again  with  Barefoot  College,  India  who  was  the  original  organisation  that  was 
<br/>engaged  by  the  previous  government  through  the  Indian  High  Commission,  and  I  will  keep 
<br/>Parliament updated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly, we have the Poverty Monitoring Unit which is still under our 
<br/>Ministry.  I have discussed with the honourable Minister of Finance where it fits, currently it will 
<br/>remain, but it will move towards putting it under the National Planning Office when that comes up 
<br/>again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  apologies,  there  is  one  more  programme,  very  quickly  which  is  the 
<br/>REACH programme supported by UNDP. I wish to thank them which takes our services out to the 
<br/>unreachable and the furthest.  I thank them for their support this year continually for the REACH 
<br/>programme  and  for  all  the  Ministries  that  will  come  on  board  and  send  their  people  on  this 
<br/>programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  appreciative  of  the  funding  that  has  been 
<br/>allocated to ensure that we deliver our services with effectiveness and innovation in our collective 
<br/>effort  to  rebuild  a  better  and  stronger  Fiji  for  our  people  living  with  disabilities,  our  elderly,  our 
<br/>children and our women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support this Budget and look forward to continuing to work hard to create a promising 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future filled with endless possibilities for all our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for dinner.  It is 
<br/>a bit late in being prepared.  It is now ready, and it will be served in the Big Committee Room and 
<br/>all are welcome to partake in it.  We will resume when the bell is sounded.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament, 
<br/>members of the public in the gallery and those who are watching from the comforts of their home 
<br/>this evening through television, radio and livestream - </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the National Budget Estimates 2023-2024 presented 
<br/>to this august House by the honourable Minister of Finance on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023.  I would like to thank 
<br/>and congratulate the honourable Minister of Finance for the Budget delivered in this august House.  
<br/>But, Mr. Speaker, it is my role to raise issues that are part of the National Budget that affects the 
<br/>citizens of this country even those who have chosen to make Fiji their home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Coalition Government’s move with the rise in Social Welfare 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allowances Beneficiaries, the increase of the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> and </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> allowances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe these were all the previous FijiFirst Government’s policies and I 
<br/>am delighted that the Coalition Government had seen the light with this assistance and not criticising 
<br/>them by saying that it is a handout that brings laziness to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note with very deep concern the direction this Government is taking this 
<br/>nation and there is concern that its destiny is not a destiny that we would welcome.  With the level 
<br/>of that kind of attitude, the people are starting to wonder if the Government really cares about its 
<br/>commitment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to start with the income tax exemption for water extraction and 
<br/>bottling  business.  The  income  of  entities  involved  in  the  extraction  and  bottling  of  water  will  be 
<br/>exempt from income tax for seven years.  I, as honourable Member from Ra Province, wishes is to 
<br/>criticise the concession to bottling companies as unwarranted and discriminatory and I call on the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  of  Finance  to  justify  the  seven-year  tax  holiday  granted  to  water  bottling 
<br/>companies including Fiji Water in the 2023-2024 National Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most popular bottled water companies in the world is Fiji Water. 
<br/>The earth finest water and its source comes from a single place in my home province, the remote 
<br/>Yaqara Valley.  Fiji Water is well established, and it should be noted that Fiji Water which is 100 
<br/>percent  foreign-owned is by far the largest  most  profitable and longest  established water bottling 
<br/>company in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the </span><span>Tikina o Vatukaloko</span><span> in which this Fiji Water acquifer sits consists of 
<br/>Drauniivi, Naseyani, Nananu, Togovere and Rabulu.  These Villages, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not get 
<br/>any great benefits from this Fiji Water Company including the province of Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  month, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I received  a complaint  from  a group of mothers from  these 
<br/>villages who earn money from selling food parcels to the workers of the Fiji Water factory.  They 
<br/>were banned from selling food in this factory and the catering services was outsourced to an outside 
<br/></span><span>company in the past few months.  What major benefits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this Fiji Water company 
<br/></span><span>has done to  the people of Ra that entitles them from tax exemption?  The Coalition Government 
<br/>should understand that it is not the question of want and needs. It is the question of priority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On one hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had the tightened the neck of average and poor income 
<br/>earners from Ra but at the same time given concession and tax holiday to wealthy tycoons.  I ask the 
<br/>Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to think of the people of the </span><span>Vanua o Ra</span><span> and not to bend down to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these wealthy tycoons.   I wish to advise the Coalition Government to remember that the </span><span>vanua</span><span> will 
<br/>always be there, but the wealthy tycoons will come and go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in VAT and customs duty will hit hard the lower to middle 
<br/>income families in Fiji as it will push up prices. As it stands, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the poor and the low-
<br/>income families simply do not have the capacity to sustain any further increases in the cost of living.  
<br/>For example, is the chicken meat which is a most common used meat in Fiji unlike the goats from 
<br/>Kadavu or the cattle meat in Vanuabalavu, maybe because of its sweetness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number 14 Rooster chicken in a supermarket now cost nearly 
<br/>$20. Coming around 1</span><span>st</span><span> August I do not know what the cost will be, probably it will be $30 or $50. 
<br/>A normal villager in the village cannot afford to pay for a chicken for his Sunday lunch.  We can talk 
<br/>in this august House to the moon and come back but the reality is that the grassroot people of this 
<br/>country are suffering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  plead  with  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  to  please  consider  the 
<br/>people who are suffering immensely.  I suggest that a mini-budget can be done within this financial 
<br/>period to cushion the hike in food prices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also saddened that there is no budgetary allocation made for the plan 
<br/>or construction of the Cane Juice Extraction Factory in the old Penang Mill site, let alone the new 
<br/>sugar mill promised to the people of Ra.  I am not blaming my ‘</span><span>auvu</span><span>, honourable Charan Jeath Singh, 
<br/>but I blame those who had promised this to the people of Ra.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have received so many complaints about this Budget from the Ra cane farmers. I, as a cane 
<br/>farmer myself, Mr. Speaker, am very disturbed together with the other farmers in Ra that promises 
<br/>of increasing the minimum guaranteed price of cane had not been kept.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farmers  are  complaining  about  the  condition  of  cane  access  roads  and  the  continuation 
<br/>breakdown of the Ba Sugar Mill where the truck drivers from Ra have to spend more than 24 hours 
<br/>to 48 hours in the mill with no words uttered by the Fiji Sugar Corporation as to a solution to the 
<br/>breakdown in the Ba Sugar Mill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many people met me in Rakiraki Town after the Budget Address and told 
<br/>me that we, the </span><span>kai</span><span> Ra, have been deceived by this Budget. In my mother tongue, this is what they 
<br/>have told me, “</span><span>‘Ako, sa dua na veilasu‘aki levu sa caka vei ki‘a. Sa ivei na qaqi ni suka va‘a na dua 
<br/>na drau na dola dua na tani ni dovu?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to apologise to the people of Ra that what majority of us have 
<br/>expected  within  this  financial  period  of  2023-2024  regarding  plans  of  the  re-construction  of  the 
<br/>Penang Sugar Mill will not eventuate.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance and the honourable Minister of Sugar to fulfil this promise made to the people of Ra in the 
<br/>next financial year. May I speak again in vernacular, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, carry on.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[The  chiefly vanua of Ra, I would like to apologise on behalf of Parliament that the mill in Ra 
<br/>will not be built this year. I humbly request the Prime Minister, our tradition kinsman (auvu), and 
<br/>also  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Minister  of  Sugar,  that  the  mill  in  Rakiraki  be  built, 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also concerned that no budgetary allocation was set aside for the 
<br/>planning or re-construction of the Nalawa Police Station in Ra. The current building which housed 
<br/>the Nalawa Police Station was built by a group of youths from Ra which currently houses more than 
<br/>10 Police Officers. The condition of that building, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has deteriorated and I ask the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Home Affairs (</span><span>na ‘uraga ma’aqali</span><span>) to look into this as the officers from that 
<br/>station including the suspects who are taken in for questioning are suffering in silence.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>this also amounts to Constitutional breach of a suspected person and it should not be taken lightly. 
<br/>The honourable Minister for Home Affairs had already visited the station and I hope he will come 
<br/>up with a solution after my contribution in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  delighted  that  the  Government  has  provided  a  Vanua  Leadership 
<br/>Allowance which is  empowering our  community leaders.  However,  I am quite disappointed that 
<br/>only  $100  is  allocated  for  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Yavusa</span><span>  and  not  $200  as  already  endorsed  by  the  Great 
<br/>Council of Chiefs (GCC). I note that my </span><span>‘uraga auvu</span><span> (the honourable Minister) is shaking his head.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the GCC which this Government has really fought for has discussed that they will receive 
<br/>$200, Mr. Speaker, Sir, then why did the Government overrule the decision of the GCC. Is the GCC 
<br/>again being used as a political tool or rubber stamp?  Again, I warn the Government, if you reconvene 
<br/>the  GCC  then  I  ask  that  respect,  manna  and  full  tradition  accorded  to  chiefs  should  always  be 
<br/>respected at all times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $100 for the </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> is very less compared to the traditional duties 
<br/>bestowed on a </span><span>Turaga</span><span> or </span><span>Marama ni Yavusa</span><span>.  The </span><span>yavusa</span><span> leaders have to maintain decorum in the 
<br/></span><span>yavusa </span><span>and his </span><span>mataqali.</span><span> They have to attend the </span><span>Bose ni Vanua, Bose ni Tikina</span><span> and the </span><span>Bose Vanua 
<br/>ni Yasana</span><span> and the $100 to me is very less compared to the work load they have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Members of Parliament (both the Government and the Opposition side) 
<br/>should always think of the hardworking grassroot people of this country, the farmers and villagers 
<br/>who work tirelessly every day from the morning till sunset to put food on the table. They leave their 
<br/>villages at around 4 a.m. to reach the market and return to their homes on Saturday evenings in order 
<br/>to earn a decent life for their families. We cannot allow to bring more hardship to our people by 
<br/>imposing Government policies that will create more hardship to them. All Governments around the 
<br/>world borrow for country development and it is the duty of all incumbent governments to continue 
<br/>with the repayment and borrow more if we can sustain it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, a decision made and the action taken would be a contributing factor 
<br/>to how the people will view the Government whether it really cares. It is now starting to show if it 
<br/>does not do anything to fulfil those promises, the people would be thinking or form the views that 
<br/>the Government is only raising their hope but actually he will not fulfil what he said to them. To 
<br/>rebut  that  statement,  the  Coalition  Government  must  take  immediate  steps  now  to  fulfil  those 
<br/></span><span>promises, and I hope the Government will actually do what they had promised immediately.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is pro-rich.  It ignores the importance of the informal sector and 
<br/>people  in  the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>.  Our  people  are  trapped  in  poverty  with  opportunities  and  alternatives.  I 
<br/>remember the book of Proverbs 22:7,  it  says, and I quote: “The rich rules over the poor, and the 
<br/>borrower is the slave of the lender.”

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1265 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words,  Mr. Speaker,  I respectfully oppose the Budget  as presented by the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance and lend my support to the response by the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- The honourable Speaker, honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  my  fellow  Fijians.    Let  me  first 
<br/>congratulate  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  his  team  at  the 
<br/>Ministry for Finance for preparing and delivering a Budget that will set Fiji on a path of recovery 
<br/>and success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, before I dwell on the gist of my speech, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, first of all, would like 
<br/>to make a few remarks on the comments and questions from honourable Members on the other side 
<br/>of Parliament. On the matter raised by the honourable Naivalurua, let me say that the statement he 
<br/>made attributed to me was not the response that I gave to the complainant in question. Let me assure 
<br/>the honourable Naivalurua and Parliament that I had spoken to the complainant as the matter was 
<br/>raised  to  me  by  a  former  Member  of  Parliament.  Upon  notifying  the  Police,  the  Police  took  the 
<br/>complainant’s statement and are investigating the matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, on the matter raised by my good friend the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>on the People’s Charter as the basis for the FijiFirst government’s National Development Plan (NDP). 
<br/>The FijiFirst government had completely in my view disregarded the work of the NCBBF whose 
<br/>recommendations played a significant part in the Yash Ghai Draft Constitution.  To confirm that, the 
<br/>Co-Chair of the NCBBF, the late Archbishop Emeritus of the Archdiocese of Suva, Petero Mataca 
<br/>wrote to the government to note his concerns that the recommendations of the NCBBF, the People’s 
<br/>Charter and the State of the Nation Report were not considered fully in the formulation of the 2013 
<br/>Constitution. The basis of the 2013 Constitution was a document called the “Strategic Framework 
<br/>for  Change”  that  was  authored  by  the  General  Secretary  of  the  FijiFirst  Party  and  the  NDP  was 
<br/>realised as a consequence of that particular document.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issues raised by the honourable Virendra Lal, I am glad to provide that information 
<br/>for  you,  Sir,  or  perhaps  later  if  you  could  raise  it  as  a  Written  Question  and  I  will  provide  it  to 
<br/>Parliament. On the concerns raised by the honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu just now, na </span><span>nodra lewe 
<br/>ni vuvale na Gone Turaga Na Tui Nalawa.  Au sa amania ika na nomudrau i ‘uku‘uku ena nomudrau

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[The chiefly </span><span>vanua</span><span>, the Tui Nalawa, I have heard the request that was brought before the House 
<br/>today about the Police Post in Nalawa and the police officers residing there.”] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  on  a  more  pleasant  note,  I  rise  today  with  a  sense  of  great  pride  and  joy  to 
<br/>congratulate  Father  Alan  Joseph  Finn  of  the  St.  John  the  Apostle  Parish  in  Natovi  on  his 
<br/>Distinguished Honour for being awarded the Companion of the Order of Fiji (CF).  Father Finn’s 
<br/>unwavering commitment to serving our community as a priest, mentor and friend has left an indelible 
<br/>mark  on  our  society.    Through  his  tireless  efforts  he  has  exemplified  the  values  of  compassion, 
<br/>kindness and selflessness becoming an inspiration to us all.  We commend Fr. Finn for his outstanding 
<br/></span><span>achievements and express our deepest gratitude for his invaluable contributions to the well-being of 
<br/></span><span>our nation and of its people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, after World War II, the world has never been in a state where global war is 
<br/>more likely.  Numerous conflicts in Eastern European, Africa and in the Middle East have led to the 
<br/>global security situation that we are now experiencing.  The war in Ukraine has offset the balance of 
<br/>power in Europe, and at one stage, Russia was implying a nuclear solution to the war.  Rogue leaders

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have essentially taken their countries to  war at  the cost  of global peace and global security.  The 
<br/>people of Ukraine are suffering from the delusion of one man.  By the same token, attentions across 
<br/>Taiwan Strait is creating great tension and geopolitical skirmishes in the bottom half of the globe, 
<br/>especially in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am informed that there is an increased military activities on a daily basis across the Strait by 
<br/>all parties that are there.  Some of them too close for comfort. We are assured by the words of the 
<br/>Chinese Minister for Defence at the Shangri- La Dialogue that I had attended, he said and I: “Any 
<br/>conflict in the Taiwan Strait is not good for the world.  I am glad that the greater powers in the world 
<br/>recognised the dire consequences of war.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same Shangri-La Dialogue, the US Secretary for Defence who spoke in the meeting 
<br/>also confirmed that the US will not condone any attack by either side of the Strait to change the status 
<br/>quo unilaterally. What does this imply for Fiji?  Our biggest challenge and threat to our security is 
<br/>climate change.  The attention of the Western world and the world at large is drawn to the Ukraine.  
<br/>The military build-up along the Taiwan Strait in the Sea of Japan, the South China Sea is diverting 
<br/>not only attention from the small island states, but also taking away billions of dollars promised in 
<br/>climate mitigation and climate adaptation funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have,  amongst  these  issues,  problems  of  our  own,  dealing  with  our  own  security.  
<br/>However, we cannot turn a blind eye to them because we will be affected by them, even if we do not 
<br/>see it.  In our own immediate neighbourhood, Australia is significantly building its military defence 
<br/>capabilities and strengthening its medium and long-range strike capabilities. How should we, as small 
<br/>island states, surrounded by other island states accept a military build-up in our region? Nations call 
<br/>it a deterrent.  We should adjust our national intentions and priorities accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a region of peace, a blue Pacific of peace, we do not desire war and 
<br/>we cannot afford war.  While those developments are happening, we in Fiji have our own internal 
<br/>security challenges, most significantly of which is to maintain peace and stability.  I take this time to 
<br/>thank our law enforcement agencies in the Fiji Police Force, the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, 
<br/>Customs, Immigration, Biosecurity and the Ministry of Health for helping to keep our country and 
<br/>our Fijian people safe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that since the announcement of the outcome of the 2022 
<br/>General Elections, some people, including politicians who have failed to earn power legitimately at 
<br/>the polls, have continually attempted to destabilise the security of our beloved Fiji.  It is a rule of law 
<br/>they do not want to respect.  They continually incite and propagate for the RFMF to take power, 
<br/>essentially  to  remove  the  elected  Government  of  the  people,  abusing  constitutional  provisions  to 
<br/>support their ambitions to take power at any cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, attempts to remove any government through the barrel of the gun must stop. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No more </span><span>coups</span><span>.  We, the Fijian people desire peace.  Any person 
<br/></span><span>or group that wishes to disrupt our peace, our security and our sovereignty deserves to be opposed 
<br/></span><span>and resisted accordingly to the law.  We have also heard that the Commander of RFMF has noted, as 
<br/>an institution, the RFMF is committed to upholding the Constitution and its values, ensuring their 
<br/>actions align with the principles of democracy and the rule of law and that any suggestion of taking 
<br/>extra  constitutional  steps  to  preserve  constitutional  structures  goes  against  the  very  democratic 
<br/>principles that RFMF has sworn to uphold.  I ask our Fijian people, please, do not use the RFMF as 
<br/>a platform to achieve your own political ambitions which you could not achieve by coming through

<br/>Judiciary is the third arm of the State.  It is there to hear and judge our grievances, please use it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me assure all Fijians, your security is secured.  It is our concern, it is your government’s 
<br/>concern, it is our responsibility to keep you safe.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Ministry of Home Affairs 
<br/>and  Immigration  to  advance  our  security,  strategic  stance  and  consolidate  the  execution  of  the 
<br/>Ministry’s  mandated  role,  it  requires  the  appropriate  budgetary  resources  to  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>Headquarters and its line agencies and institutions.  I am indeed appreciative of the Budget allocated 
<br/>to my Ministry and to the two security Forces.  In our ambition for global and regional recognition 
<br/>of  being  the  hub  of  the  Pacific,  it  is  important  that  we  develop  and  establish  mechanisms  that 
<br/>recognise  the  full  spectrum  of  the  value  that  our  defence  and  security  interests  offer  to  ordinary 
<br/>Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocated funds of $324,202 for the National Security and Defence Review as announced 
<br/>by  His  Excellency  the  President  is  a  significant  investment  that  will  enable  the  Government  to 
<br/>undertake  a  holistic  National  Security  and  Defence  Review.    The  Defence  and  National  Security 
<br/>review  will  be  a  strategic  assessment  of  Fjji’s  national  security  architecture  and  the  role  of  the 
<br/>Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a world marked by rapid changes and emerging threats, this review is of utmost importance.  
<br/>By  proactively  adapting  to  evolving  security  challenges,  we  strengthen  our  ability  to  protect  our 
<br/>citizens,  our  children,  maintain  law  and  order  and  safeguard  our  national  interests.    The 
<br/>Government’s commitment to  the integrity and security of our travel  documents is  evident in  the 
<br/>allocation of funds for the procurement of passports and the installation of e-passport kits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are taking significant steps to align ourselves with the global standards and bolster the 
<br/>confidence of international travellers. The allocation of $1.5 million for the procurement of passports 
<br/>and an additional $300,000 for the installation of e-passport kits in Immigration Offices and overseas 
<br/>missions,  ensure  the  issuance  of  secure  and  reliable  travel  documents  which  are  essential  for  our 
<br/>citizens to exercise their rights and access opportunities abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Minister of Finance, the Fiji Police Force 
<br/>has been allocated a budget of $183.7 million, an increase of $3 million from the 2022-2023 Revised 
<br/>Budget.  This commitment by the Government will surely bolster policing activities that will ensure 
<br/>a safe and secure Fiji through peaceful co-existence and the general maintenance of law and order.  
<br/>As part of the Security and Defence Review, the Fiji Police Force has been allocated $50,000 to carry 
<br/>out the Review of the Police Act 1965. This review through public consultation will provide a holistic 
<br/>view of opinions from all those that will be impacted in order for the development of a Police Act 
<br/>that will empower their operations and bring back confidence in our Fiji Police Force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the increase in budget will greatly assist the Fiji Police Force in upgrading their 
<br/>technical equipment in order to effectively combat transnational organised crimes whilst maintaining 
<br/>the safety and security of our citizens. I commend the allocation of $2.3 million for the recruitment 
<br/>of  100  additional  Police  Constables  which  will  strengthen  the  Force's  operational  capabilities, 
<br/>enhance its presence and enable more effective crime prevention and response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the allocation of $700,000.00 to strengthen the Police Beat Patrol in both urban 
<br/>and rural areas is a laudable initiative in our ongoing efforts to improve police visibility and enhance 
<br/>community safety. This strategic investment will foster close engagement between the police force 
<br/>and local  communities, build trust  and promote a collaborative approach to  crime prevention. By 
<br/>proactively  patrolling  our  streets  and  neighborhoods,  the  police  force  will  be  better  positioned  to 
<br/>detect and deter criminal activities, ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  it  is  crucial  to  address  the  maintenance  and  improvement  of  our  police 
<br/>infrastructure. The allocation of $3 million for the renovation and upgrade of police quarters and 
<br/>posts  demonstrates  the  Government's  commitment  to  rectify  years  of  neglect  and  some  existing 
<br/>police stations, quarters, and posts have faced.   and I believe here is also included the Nalawa Police 
<br/>Post.  Ensuring that our police officers have suitable and well-maintained working environments is 
<br/>vital for their morale, productivity, and overall effectiveness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By upgrading these facilities, we not only provide better living and working conditions for 
<br/>our police personnel but also enhance their ability to serve and protect our communities with utmost 
<br/>dedication.    Community  policing  is  now  at  the heart  and  centre  of  the  Police’s  Priorities  and  the 
<br/>government will make it its business to support and equip community policing operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the increase in the Republic of Fiji Military 
<br/>Forces’ (RFMF) allocation from $94.1 million last financial year to $103.1 million in the 2023-2024 
<br/>financial  year.  The  RFMF  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  maintaining  our  nation's  security,  defence,  and 
<br/>supporting  peace  efforts  both  regionally  and  globally.  This  allocation  is  a  testament  to  the 
<br/>government's recognition of the RFMF's important contributions. The RFMF plays a pivotal role in 
<br/>maintaining our national security, defence, and supporting peace efforts both regionally and globally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the increase in the RFMF allocation will provide the strength needed to boost 
<br/>the  RFMF  Engineers.  Apart  from  the  work  undertaken  by  the  Engineers  within  the  RFMF,  the 
<br/>regiment also assists Government in its rural rehabilitation efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the allocation of $50,000 is very encouraging for the review of the RFMF 
<br/>Act which will enable the RFMF to amend their archaic legislation. It is anticipated that the review 
<br/>will  revamp  the  RFMF  in  fulfilling  its  responsibilities,  including  safeguarding  our  sovereignty, 
<br/>contributing  to  international  peacekeeping  missions,  and  responding  to  emergencies  and  natural 
<br/>disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RFMF's dedication, professionalism, and commitment to upholding the values of peace 
<br/>and  security  are  commendable,  and  this  allocation  recognizes  the  invaluable  contribution  to  our 
<br/>nation.    Again,  I  express  my  unwavering  support  for  the  budgetary  allocations  presented  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance for the Ministry for Home Affairs and Immigration, the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force  and  the  Republic  of  Fiji  Military  Forces.  These  investments  epitomize  the  government's 
<br/>steadfast  commitment  to  our  collective  safety  and  security.  Let  us  stand  united  and  work 
<br/>collaboratively to ensure that the allocated funds are utilized effectively and efficiently for the benefit 
<br/>of all our Fijian people.  Together, we will build a stronger, more resilient Fiji, a nation that thrives 
<br/>on the foundations of safety, security, prosperity and equality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, as we deliberate on this Budget, let us celebrate the achievements of exemplary 
<br/>individuals like Fr. Alan Finn  who embodies the values which we hold  dear. Let  us confront the 
<br/>challenges  before  us  with  determination  and  a  united  spirit,  committed  to  upholding  democracy, 
<br/>defending the rule of law, and eradicating </span><span>coup</span><span> culture once and for all. By doing so, we shall pave 
<br/>the way for a future where every Fijian can thrive, and our nation can rise to even greater heights in 
<br/>peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I extend my gratitude to each one of you for your tireless dedication to serving our nation, 
<br/>and I express my unwavering faith in our collective ability to steer Fiji towards a brighter future. 
<br/>Thank you, and may we continue to govern with integrity and purpose.

<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, the honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of our

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1269 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition  Chambers.    I  stand  today  to  give  my  response  to  the  Budget  Address  given  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament is convened today to debate on the National Budget for 2023-
<br/>2024 before us. This is to decide our future fiscal policy ahead of us.  However, the first priority in 
<br/>deciding the future of this country is our people.  Our people make up this diverse and multicultural 
<br/>nation with different socio-economic backgrounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge each and every one of us to consider the potential consequences of 
<br/>the  increase  in  VAT  on  basic  consumer  goods.    While  fiscal  policies  are  essential  for  economic 
<br/>stability and growth, it is important to examine their impact on the economy as a whole, especially 
<br/>on the most vulnerable members of society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must acknowledge that the backbone of our flourishing economy is its 
<br/>consumers.  The consumer sector drives demand, fosters innovation, and supports businesses both 
<br/>large  and  small.    However,  an  increase  in  VAT  on  essential  goods  could  burden  consumers, 
<br/>particularly those belonging to lower-income brackets or living in poverty.  Such measures have the 
<br/>potential to diminish their purchasing power and exacerbate existing inequalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one must understand that basic consumer goods, including essential food 
<br/>items, clothing and healthcare products constitute a significant portion of household expenditure for 
<br/>many individuals and families.  A rise in VAT on these necessities would consequently place undue 
<br/>strain on their budgets, hampering their ability to meet their basic needs.  This can lead to a sharp 
<br/>decline in consumer spending, stifling economic activity and potentially triggering a slow down or 
<br/>even a recession. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  consumers  are  forced  to  allocate  a  larger  portion  of  their 
<br/>income to essential goods due to increased VAT, discretionary spending on non-essential items may 
<br/>decline.  This, in turn, could adversely affect businesses across various sectors resulting in reduced 
<br/>profits, job losses and a decline in overall economic growth. We must consider the potential ripple 
<br/>effects and unintended consequences before implementing any policies that could hinder consumer 
<br/>spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also crucial to remember that the current economic climate, marked by 
<br/>uncertainty and challenges, calls for measures that promote economic recovery and stability. While 
<br/>it  may  be  tempting  to  generate  revenue  through  VAT  increases,  alternative  solutions  should  be 
<br/>explored.  Increased emphasis on fair taxation, closing loopholes and combating tax evasion can help 
<br/>generate income without burdening consumers. By adopting a more equitable approach, we can foster 
<br/>a thriving economy that benefits individuals from all walks of life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, any decision to increase VAT on basic consumer goods should be made after 
<br/>careful  deliberation.  We  must  recognize  the  essential  role  consumers  play  in  driving  economic 
<br/>growth and the potential repercussions that an increase in VAT can have on their purchasing power, 
<br/>economic activity and overall prosperity. Let  us stand for policies that prioritise the wellbeing  of 
<br/>people  who  at  the  end  of  the  day  are  our  consumers  while  simultaneously  seeking  alternative 
<br/></span><span>solutions to address fiscal challenges.  Only through thoughtful, balanced and fair approaches can we 
<br/></span><span>ensure a robust and inclusive economy for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite impressive how the honourable Minister of Finance has managed 
<br/>to deceive the public through this Budget.  All Fijians regardless of their political affiliation will be 
<br/>going through the price increase.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wonder who in their right state of mind will want the Government to 
<br/>increase VAT?  This deceitful act of increasing VAT for the people is day light robbery. I ask who 
<br/>wins from this and who gains from this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I come from a sugar cane farming background, and we faced a lot of challenges 
<br/>during our time until FijiFirst stepped in to assist the sugar industry.  Under the FijiFirst Government, 
<br/>farmers were provided $1,900 to prepare hilly land for sugarcane production.  This did not stop here, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. FijiFirst Government supported more than 200,000 people dependent on sugarcane 
<br/>cultivation in the form of grants and subsidies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to inform the current honourable Minister of Sugar that the former Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister of Sugar was not sleeping on the job. He has done  a lot and I will urge the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Sugar to show some respect to the former Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- I think he is sleeping on the job because of the performance of the sugar 
<br/>mills and the suffering of the farmers and truck drivers.  The honourable Minister is sleeping on the 
<br/>job.  Further  efforts  by  FijiFirst  were  geared  towards  increasing  productive  capacity,  improving 
<br/>transportation, providing in-fielders and cage bins to support mechanical harvesting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, all the mechanical harvesters which are running under the co-operatives 
<br/>the former Prime Minister and Minister of Sugar gave $90,000 grant to purchase all those harvesters.  
<br/>I personally would like to thank him as I am also a founder and the President of Riverside Farmers 
<br/>Co-operative in Ba where we serve about 80 farmers, and we were able to purchase a harvester for 
<br/>the  farmers.  FijiFirst  provided  much  needed  funding  for  research  in  improving  the  quality  cane 
<br/>seedlings and improved soil fertility. It also ensured that unused sugar cane leases are acquired and 
<br/>replanted, secured more lease renewals and further mechanisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, the sugar industry supports the livelihoods of thousands of 
<br/>Fijians. The industry drives rural development such as upgraded rural roads, giving farmers access 
<br/>to agricultural inputs and machinery for their farms and access to markets, urban centres, schools and 
<br/>health services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the economic side, FijiFirst had done all it can to make sure cane farming 
<br/>provided an adequate living.  Given the pressure of international prices and the need to make the 
<br/>industry more efficient, FijiFirst allocated public funds to support programmes aimed at increasing 
<br/>cane production and guaranteed cane prices to growers which I hope the honourable Prof. Biman 
<br/>Prasad will upkeep. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  rising  cost  of  production  such  as  cartage,  harvesting  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased labour rates and other hidden costs, farmers are raising questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! No running commentary, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- When will the honourable Minister of Finance keep up to his promise of 
<br/>giving $100 a tonne?  He is on record and apart from this $100 a tonne promised which has been 
<br/>ongoing from 2017 there were lot other promises made during the last election campaign.  Some of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="102">Page 102</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1271 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our  honourable  Members  are  denying  here  but  the  farmers  outside  know  who  all  made  those 
<br/>promises.  These are farmers whom he campaigned to who are now asking when will he fulfil his 
<br/>promise? They are looking forward to this payment this season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this crushing season, the Ministry of Sugar through FSC has increased the cost 
<br/>of cartage of sugarcane by FSC trucks. FSC has also increased the rate of tractor services to farmers 
<br/>from $85 to $112.50.  Previously cartage rate was subsidised.  For example, a farmer from Naruku 
<br/>in Ba was paying $12 per tonne to cart cane to Rarawai Mill for FSC trucks, however this crushing 
<br/>season this has increased to $14 per tonne. This is a similar scenario where farmers are using FSC 
<br/>trucks for cane cartage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prof. Biman Prasad had stated that he will give more money to 
<br/>farmers this year as there is one more payment left and that also has been confirmed by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Sugar.  Does this mean that he will give from one hand and take it from the other side?  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should also be noted that all activities under the Ministry of Sugar is under R 
<br/>which means that all funds are under the control and approval of the honourable Minister of Finance.  
<br/>This  raises  questions  that  is  seems  that  honourable  Prof.  Biman  Prasad  has  trust  issues  with  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Sugar, and I will request to please sort out your differences in the interest of 
<br/>all farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers are grateful to the FijiFirst initiatives that the Coalition Government 
<br/>is now carrying on.  However, there seems to be a decrease in fertilizer subsidy for farmers from $25 
<br/>million to $20 million and a major increase in travel and subsistence allocations.  We all know that 
<br/>it is connected to everything else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fertilizers subsidies plays a crucial role in the sugar industry. Sugar crops require specific 
<br/>nutrients to grow efficiently and produce high yields.  Fertilizers provide these essential nutrients to 
<br/>the soil and plants promoting healthy growth and increasing sugar cane productivity. By providing 
<br/>subsidies on fertilizers to  farmers, it can make them more affordable and accessible to  sugarcane 
<br/>farmers especially smallholders who may have limited financial resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By reducing the cost burden, subsidies encourage farmers to invest in fertilisers and use them 
<br/>appropriately. This in turn enhances the overall quality and quantity of sugarcane produce.  However, 
<br/>the decrease in subsidies for fertilisers from sugarcane farmers as listed in the Budget items from $25 
<br/>million to $20 million can have significant implications for the sugar industry including decreased 
<br/>productivity due to limited access to affordable fertilisers. This can lead to a decline in a crop yield 
<br/>and lower productivity levels.  As a result, the overall sugarcane production may decrease impacting 
<br/>the industry’s output.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  decrease  in  subsidies,  sugarcane  farmers  will  have  to  bear  the 
<br/>additional  cost  of  purchasing  fertilisers.    This  can  significantly  increase  their  production  cost, 
<br/>affecting their profitability.  The increased expenses may be passed onto the sugar industry leading 
<br/>to higher prices for consumers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this can also lead to shift in farmer behaviour. Reduce subsidies may prompt 
<br/>some  struggling  sugarcane  farmers  to  explore  alternative  crops  that  require  different  types  of 
<br/>fertilisers,  impacting  the  overall  supply  of  sugarcane.    This  could  result  in  a  shift  away  from 
<br/>traditional sugarcane farming practices leading to changes in the industry’s structure.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out that this Budget overall does not address concerns 
<br/>of people on the ground. With the increased cost of living this will impact the lives of hundreds of 
<br/>thousands of families who will be burdened to pay more from their limited budget. This will greatly 
<br/>affect the farming communities, settlements and villages in rural and maritime communities. With 
<br/>these words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly oppose this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Ministers,  
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, guests sitting at the gallery 
<br/>and those who are watching from their own homes.  </span><span>Ni 1272inaka1272 1272inaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the 2023-2024 Budget that was delivered on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>June, 2023 by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.   Firstly, I wish to 
<br/>respond to some of the issues that were just being raised by honourable Pillay with regards to the 
<br/>sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the last 10 years, this industry has been heavily subsidised by the Fiji Government; $1 
<br/>billion for the last 10 years and we are subsidising everyone from those who are producing 50 tonnes, 
<br/>100 tonnes to 400 tonnes.  This Government will need to look at this seriously on how we are going 
<br/>to address the industry.  We are going to look at the returns of how much we are getting because a 
<br/>lot of funds had been spent - $1 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, compiling a comprehensive budge against an economic backdrop that the 
<br/>Coalition Government has inherited is a difficult task. I want to first acknowledge all the hardworking 
<br/>civil servants who worked long hours to help the honourable Minister of Finance put this Budget 
<br/>together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a far cry from the Budgets of the last 16 years which were dictated by 
<br/>two men and two men only.  Now we can hear them barking, but in the last two Parliaments, they 
<br/>never had any say at  all in the planning and formulation of the Budgets. Their inputs were never 
<br/>taken on board by their Minister for Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Budget  for  new  Fiji  provides  an  adequate  prescription  to  getting  the  economic 
<br/>management of our country back on track.  Indeed, the tough decisions have to be made.  This Budget 
<br/>is here to liberate all the Fijians from the shackles of dictatorial leadership that the two men rule 
<br/>which has brought this country to the brink of economic collapse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Civil Service, to set some context to what the People’s Coalition 
<br/>Government has inherited, it is important to remind this august Parliament about the state of the Civil 
<br/>Service merely a little over seven months ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government for eight years in Office bragged that they would 
<br/>reform the Civil Service to a more world class international civil service. They introduced policy 
<br/>initiative such as the Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS) to reform the recruitment system in 
<br/>the Civil Service. Instead, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the size of the Civil Service during their term increased 
<br/>from  27,000  to  35,000.   Initially  the  cost  of  the Civil  Service  was  only  $700  million.    When  the 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst ended their term, the cost of maintaining the Civil Service was $1.26 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, where is efficiency that they have talked about? We have not witnessed any 
<br/>evidence of this.  Those of us who worked through the ranks of the Government know for a fact how 
<br/>civil servants were manipulated by the previous government.  Positive criticism was not encouraged.  
<br/>In summary, it was their way or the highway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="104">Page 104</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1273 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service became a workforce of “yes people” who did not question 
<br/>policy for fear of being sacked.  In fact, there was a running joke for it.  Those who dared to question 
<br/>or provide critical analysis of the </span><span>status quo</span><span> risked reaching 55 prematurely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many  government  workplaces  became  toxic  where  civil  servants  were 
<br/>reprimanded if seen in the company of citizens who did not publicly support government policy.  It 
<br/>is a known fact that many would avoid fraternising with family members, colleagues and friends just 
<br/>to avoid being accused of disloyalty to government. In effect, the absence of sound analysis so as not 
<br/>to rock the boat was consequently a disservice to our citizens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of good economic cadre within government cost government.  For 
<br/>example, the National Planning Office which was a competent technical secretariat of government 
<br/>and that provided policy analysis and advise to the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister. When 
<br/>the Ministry of Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics was disbanded, we gradually 
<br/>began  to  witness  the  proposal  and  implementation  of  policies  that  lacked  thorough  analysis  and 
<br/>informed advise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2023-2024 Budget tabled before Parliament for debate addresses the anomaly we now 
<br/>have to deal with as a result of poorly researched policies.  I am confident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 
<br/>2023-2024 Budget will help steer us out of the economic mess that we have inherited.  In an attempt 
<br/>to control everything, self-serving changes to Civil Service structure resulted in one-man-rule that 
<br/>lacked a higher level of scrutiny before recommendations are tabled for consideration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that our economy is stuck in a serious debt hole of some $9.8 
<br/>billion.    A  debt  hole  that  is  a  record  for  Fiji  and  largely  the  creation  of  your  previous  two-man 
<br/>dictatorship.  We heard the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Manoa Kamikamica yesterday about 
<br/>the gaping hole of of $500 million created by the FijiFirst Government.   That is why we have to 
<br/>increase the VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent. We have to do this to ensure that we cover the various 
<br/>gaping holes created by FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VAT  Increase,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  has  been  transparent  and 
<br/>consultative when it comes to this Budget.  We have made it clear, difficult decisions needed to be 
<br/>made to address the major debt crisis we have found ourselves in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his State of the Nation Address just before the Budget announcement, 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister highlighted that to rebuild this nation, it will not be for business as 
<br/>usual.  The  Government  needed  to  consider  hard  decisions  now  to  ensure  future  growth  and 
<br/>prosperity. Yes, VAT has increased but we have also put in place a number of measures to mitigate 
<br/>the adverse impacts to the poor. We will increase social welfare payments, reduce duty on certain 
<br/>goods and made a commitment to increase access to basic services. We recognised that there will be 
<br/>short-term  pain,  but  this  is  ultimately  for  the  long-term  benefit  of  all  Fijians  for  a  resilient  and 
<br/>sustainable Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate the honourable Prime Minister’s message that this Budget has been prepared to 
<br/>consolidate Government finances, minimise wastage, address our high debt level, allocate resources 
<br/></span><span>to  priority  sectors  and  increase  access  to  basic  services.    This  is  a  people-centered  and  forward-
<br/></span><span>looking Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian  Broadcasting  Corporation  (FBC),  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday  honourable  Aliki  Bia 
<br/>made a number of unfounded allegations against FBC.  Honourable Bia had asked if there has been 
<br/>an investigation into the spending of FBC when the former CEO had provided all the facts to the new 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Board, which was apparently ignored.   Honourable Bia had alleged that the new FBC Board opted 
<br/>to misinform the media about FBC and its operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those comments by the honourable Bia as a desperate attempt by him to 
<br/>make allegations without any substance, information or details.  The Chairman and the Board have 
<br/>at no time misinformed the public on FBC’s operation, but at all times stated the facts of the matter 
<br/>in  a  transparent  and  accountable  manner,  including  the  fact  that  under  the  previous  leadership, 
<br/>without the PSB grant, FBC was technically insolvent.  It may please honourable Bia to know that 
<br/>in a short space of time of four months, the new leadership have attained for the first six months 
<br/>unaudited figures of $1 million, more than what was achieved in the same time last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Honourable Bia further went on to allege that the Chairman was using 
<br/>the boardroom for his personal business almost every day.  This is far from the truth.  The Chairman 
<br/>and many Board members use it only for FBC related businesses and the positive results go to show 
<br/>this.    The  Board  had  already  mandated  that  any  extravagance  and  wastage  such  as  the  $207,000 
<br/>vehicle bought by the previous Board for the previous CEO would be eliminated and FBC would be 
<br/>operated in an efficient and effective manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-This can be seen in the newsroom operating now in a free, fair, balanced 
<br/>and  objective  manner  rather  than  as  previous  where  it  was  at  the  risk  of  undue  influence  by  the 
<br/>previous CEO.  Yes, or course, some staff have resigned for reasons that will suit them.  The FBC 
<br/>leadership is committed to running the company in an efficient and effective manner.  The FBC has 
<br/>an obligation to ensure that its staff are utilised well for their skills and the Board and management 
<br/>are extremely grateful for the diligence and hard work shown by the staff to be part of the company 
<br/>that is managed efficiently and has staff safety, including living a balanced life in mind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FBC and the Government have an existing contract covering PSB services and we are 
<br/>always open to meeting with them to ensure that there will always be an open transparent process in 
<br/>how the funds are utilised.  All things considered, FBC is now free and balanced in reporting and in 
<br/>its  use  of  all  content  across  its  many  media  platforms.    It  has  also  cut  out  extravagant  expenses 
<br/>accorded previously and is already ahead of its financial target for the year being $1 million more 
<br/>positive than the same period last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Melanesians, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like touch on a topic that is very dear to me, which is 
<br/>the plight of the Melanesian people who have co-existed with other races that exist in this country 
<br/>for several decades.   Honourable Aliki Bia yesterday alluded to the limited scholarships opportunity 
<br/>for  Melanesian  communities.    Access  to  education  remains  a  key  priority  of  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government.    We  are  committed  to  ensuring  students  are  able  to  study  and  unlock  greater 
<br/>opportunities for the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  recognised  that  they  cannot  fully  do  this  while  burdened  with  debt.    There  is  a  total 
<br/>allocation of $148.2 million in this Budget for this initiative.  This will cater for the scholarships of 
<br/>8,720 students and funding needed for the 9,148 existing students.  In return, students will serve a 
<br/>bond.  I believe that like our Budget, this scheme is fair and balanced.  It is a way to make tertiary 
<br/>education  available  to  low-income  families  without  burdening  our  students  with  great  debt.    Mr.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, we will accord priority to the needs of Melanesian students who wish to access this 
<br/>programme.  Every Melanesian who applies will be provided with this support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since I took oath in office, I have since visited many of the Melanesian settlements namely, 
<br/>Maniava, Nabunikadamu, Wailoku, Caubati, Newtown and Nasoata. Mr. Speaker, Sir I learned in 
<br/>those  visits  about  how  very  little  the  previous  government  has  cared  about  the  welfare  of  this 
<br/>important segment of the community.  They currently face an uncertain future as majority of the land 
<br/>they live on, have no formal lease with several on the verge of expiring.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  People’s  Coalition  Government  promises  to  look  into  the  plight  of  our  Melanesian 
<br/>communities and ensure that the settlements they live in are formalised.  Last week the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands was in Ovalau to undertake discussions with the people of Baba and initiate the 
<br/>process of formalising their land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, People’s Coalition Government has presented a future focused and people 
<br/>centred Budget, one that considers how our actions today will affect Fiji tomorrow.  We must be bold 
<br/>enough to confront the issues head-on and make the tough decision today for the sake of our children 
<br/>and grandchildren.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, I am honoured to support the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister in the execution of duties through his ministerial portfolios which include 
<br/>Cabinet, Climate Change Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran 
<br/>Affairs.  Each portfolio plays a critical role in the sustainable development of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite continued impact from the crisis including the climate change and 
<br/>external  conflict,  the  People’s  Coalition  Government  will  work  towards  achieving  our  vison  of 
<br/>“Rebuilding our Future Together” for a resilient Fiji.  This vision is clearly reflected in the Budget 
<br/>allocations with the targeted approach to implementation, growth and development.  I am heartened 
<br/>by the commitment to the environment and climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department  of Environment  will continue to ensure that Fiji’s natural  environment  is 
<br/>protected,  resources  are  sustainably  utilised,  all  developments  are  sustainable,  the  ozone  layer  is 
<br/>protected, waste is properly managed and pollution is controlled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  2023-2024  Budget  provides  for  the  People’s  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>commitment  to  safeguarding  our  natural  environment  and  ensuring  there  is  a  balance  between 
<br/>sustainable  development  and  economic  prosperity.    The  Department  of  Environment  has  been 
<br/>allocated funds for the upgrading and maintenance work of the Naboro Landfill.  This includes the 
<br/>completion  of  additional  sections  to  cater  for  waste  generated  in  the  Lami,  Suva,  Nausori  and 
<br/>Korovou corridor.  The maintenance of the Naboro Landfill leachate treatment pond and a subsidised 
<br/>gate fee for municipal councils in the Central Division to collect and properly dispose waste.  It is 
<br/>imperative  that  our  waste  management  systems  are  effective,  efficient  and  safe  for  the  receiving 
<br/>environment and human health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Environment will be developing Fiji’s Container Deposit 
<br/></span><span>Regulation.  This will be an avenue to explore new opportunities to transform waste into valuable 
<br/></span><span>resources, reducing our reliance on raw materials and promoting a circular economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that prevention is better than cure.  It is clear that preventing pollution will reduce 
<br/>financial and environmental costs. Reducing pollution and promoting conservation and the protection 
<br/>of  Fiji’s  natural  resources  including  our  terrestrial  and  economic  and  ocean  ecosystems  and 
<br/>biodiversity such as coral, forests, rivers, lakes and wildlife will be a key priority for this Government.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department  of Environment  will implement programmes relating  to  conservation and 
<br/>sustainable  resource  management  and  enforcement  in  safeguarding  these  ecosystems  and  species 
<br/>across Fiji, including through the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  acknowledge  that  partnerships  are  key  in  this  work.    I  recognise  the 
<br/>Department for their continued collaboration with relevant agencies in meeting our environmental 
<br/>protection, conservation and biodiversity goals.  This includes nationwide Business Roundtables and 
<br/>EIA clinics.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department will also develop a series of use-friendly, multi-lingual fact sheets to provide 
<br/>information and guidance on the EIA process.  The fact sheets will incorporate quick tips, frequently 
<br/>asked questions and clarification on relevant laws made available through the Department’s website 
<br/>for ease of access by investors, businesses and the general public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  will  continue  outreach  programmes  in  villages  and 
<br/>communities in the areas of proper waste management, conservation and protection of their natural 
<br/>resources, sustainable utilization of resources, including the impacts of climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  empowering  Fijians  with  knowledge,  we  can  encourage  greater  responsibility  towards 
<br/>waste  reduction.  The  Department  will  collaborate  with  schools,  universities  and  community 
<br/>organisations to raise awareness in the hope that our citizens will adopt sustainable habits.  It is up to 
<br/>all of us, and we each have a part to play in ensuring environmental conservation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  climate  change,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  commend  the  work  of  the  Climate  Change 
<br/>Division.  This  budget  will  allow  them  to  continue  the  good  work  in  addressing  the  devastating 
<br/>impacts of climate change in vulnerable island nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Climate  Change  Division  will  receive  allocations  of  direct  budget 
<br/>support from the European Union (EU) and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  
<br/>This shows the high level of confidence our partners have in Fiji and our ability to implement positive 
<br/>change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The EU is providing funding to implement the Climate Change Act 2021.  This allocation 
<br/>will be used to facilitate and support Fiji’s sustainable development objectives, long-term climate 
<br/>ambition, net-zero emission target, and commitment to protecting Fiji’s environment.  This will also 
<br/>contribute to Fiji’s sustainable, inclusive and resilient low carbon development as a long-term goal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Climate Change Division will also be updating and maintaining Fiji’s 
<br/>Climate Change portal, a central information hub that collates and makes available climate change 
<br/>data, reports and other information that can be used to raise awareness and strengthen capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has long been a leader on the issue of climate change and seen as a 
<br/>champion regionally and internationally.  The People’s Coalition Government will continue this work 
<br/>and reaffirm our commitment to addressing this issue both through impacts being faced by our people 
<br/></span><span>and communities, as well as advocating for higher ambition at international fora. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate our Ministry for Finance’s message, and I quote; “Nations are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>built by people, on the foundations of unity and mutual cooperation.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this spirit, I would like to conclude by, again, thanking every individual who contributed 
<br/>to  the  development  of  this  Budget.    I  thank  everyone  who  has  participated  in  its  preparation,

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  extend  my  full  support  and  endorsement  of  the  2023-2024  National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  distinguished  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and those who are tuning into the Budget debate via the various telecast network, </span><span>ni sa 
<br/>bula vinaka</span><span> and good evening to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the 2023-2024 National Budget 
<br/>Debate.  I  would  like  to  begin  by  thanking  all  healthcare  workers  in  the  Ministry  of  Health  and 
<br/>Medical Services, the Permanent Secretary - Dr. James Fong, right down to the drivers and cleaners 
<br/>for your patriotism, dedication and personal sacrifices in the provision of health services towards all 
<br/>Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To all the bilateral partners, thank you for assisting Fiji during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in supporting the FijiFirst mitigation strategies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today provides me with an opportunity to put on record my heartfelt thanks 
<br/>to all the staff of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.  Thank you for your contribution in 
<br/>the last financial year, most importantly, during the uncertain COVID-19 pandemic period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023-2024 National Budget is a much-awaited Budget that the whole 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nation was waiting for since the formation of the Coalition Government in December last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nation came to a standstill at around 10.00 am last Friday to listen to the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance, the President of the most aging party in Fiji, to give his first-ever 
<br/>National Budget Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nation was eagerly waiting with great anticipation to see that the 
<br/>learned Professor of Economics would be different from a successful lawyer, who managed Fiji’s 
<br/>economy  effectively  with  proven  10  years  of  consecutive  unprecedented  economic  growth.    The 
<br/>nation went through two Category 5 Cyclones that shrink our economy over night, the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic through which the glaring ongoing challenges of the climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the honourable Minister of Finance’s Address, all I can say is that it was 
<br/>anti-climactic.  We all expected this amazing Budget that would change Fiji, considering that the 
<br/>honourable  Member  who  presented  the  Budget  has  been  harping  on  about  this  and  that  for  eight 
<br/>years.  we all anticipated that something new and innovative would be presented in this Budget, but 
<br/>it was a copy of the last Budget and we all expected he knew what he was doing.  Well, I was wrong, 
<br/>but hey, there is a next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of the Parliament are expressing strongly our feelings of worry and 
<br/></span><span>concern about what is happening that would become of this Budget for the middle and low income 
<br/></span><span>breadwinners in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed 15 percent VAT increase by the Government will be burdened 
<br/>for the low-income brackets of our society and our country.  To all ordinary Fijians who are listening 
<br/>to the sound of my voice, if this Budget is passed, Lord help us!

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In less than three weeks, expect a day to dig deeper into your pocket to pay more for almost 
<br/>everything - your EFL, your water bill, hardware materials, lawyers’ fees, doctor’s fees and dentist 
<br/>fees, plumbing materials, bus fare, food items, cleaning agents and many more.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, there will be a rise in cost of almost everything.  I say again, help us Lord! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, prepared by the Professor of Economics is, in my opinion, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intellectually dishonest and vague.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me sound a warning to the honourable Prime Minister, Sir, sighting what 
<br/>has transpired in the last six months and the content of this budget - be very wary of your money 
<br/>man. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to speak on Head 22.  On the onset, I am calling the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance to apologize to the staff of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services for the 
<br/>remarks he made about the appalling health services and healthcare staff.  The honourable Member 
<br/>chooses to forget that we just came out of a global pandemic that put an extra pressure on the whole 
<br/>world and the whole health sector to a level that it is not designed for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here, we have the honourable Minister of Finance, shouting at the entire health professionals 
<br/>and the Permanent Secretary, both inside and outside of this august Parliament as reported in the </span><span>Fiji 
<br/>Times</span><span> on the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> of this month, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Get out of your office and look at what is happening.  No use sitting in the office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and signing papers.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am here to tell Parliament that all the lies spread by honourable Members 
<br/>on the other side, especially the Leader of NFP, that we have a failed and decaying health system, 
<br/>this is not true. In fact, we have a fantastic healthcare system in Fiji when you compare it with the 
<br/>other developed nations of the world. Look at their waiting time to be seen by a doctor or dentist 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The group, Mr. Speaker, need to open their eyes.  Other than looking through a binoculars for 
<br/>broken  door  hinges,  or  a  falling  toilet  seat  pan,  they  failed  the  see  the  bigger  picture  of  the 
<br/>advancement in the health sector under the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  made  some  of  the  very  difficult  choices  through  decisive 
<br/>leadership to keep the economy moving forward and making sure that services are still available for 
<br/>ordinary Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You hear how the honourable Minister of Finance has played the blame game, always trying 
<br/>to  paint a bad picture about  FijiFirst.  It  has become one of your favourite line, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>“Sound like a broken record”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Fiscal Review Committee headed by convicted lawyer/solicitor and legal 
<br/>advisor  to  the  biggest  water  bottling  company  -  Fiji  Water,  submitted  recommendations  to  the 
<br/>Coalition, followed by the gathering of big players in economic diligences for a two-day summit at 
<br/></span><span>a lucrative hotel with a </span><span>kalavata</span><span>. Everything is connected to everything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are reliably informed by some of these reputative financial institutions that 
<br/>all their suggestions made to the honourable Minister and the entire thematic teams that are there in 
<br/>the National Economic Summit were not taken on board or seen in this Budget.  Not only that they 
<br/>were  disappointed,  but  they  confidently  said  that  they  will  not  participate  in  the  future  economic 
<br/>summit.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1279 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, over millions of dollars approved through bank loans are still sitting 
<br/>in the bank.  The building industry in coming to a complete halt, no creation of new jobs, spending 
<br/>power of ordinary Fijians being diminished. I can confidently say we are heading to an economic 
<br/>downturn - Lord help us! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  asked  the  same  question  raised  by  honourable  Bia  yesterday.  Does  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  have  any  other  way  in  his  hat  trick  to  raise  Government  revenue  other  than 
<br/>forcing this 15 percent VAT down the throat of ordinary Fijians? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation by the Fiscal Review Committee and endorsed by the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  consecutively  will  come  as  a 
<br/>huge burden to our fellow Fijians, especially those that are in the $30,000 to $50,000 income brackets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the most vulnerable Fijians are not supported at all in this Budget. The health 
<br/>services provided by the FijiFirst aimed at bringing high standard of healthcare every day, improving 
<br/>accessibility and quality healthcare, free of charge to all Fijians and for all Fijians to have good health 
<br/>and a brighter smile.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  leaves  the  majority  in  the  $30,000 to  $50,000  income 
<br/>bracket in the rain as they will no longer be entitled to access  free General Practitioners and free 
<br/>medicine, free lab analysis and blood sample analysis under the National Healthcare Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, in the 2023-2024 Budget, the honourable Minister has lessened the number of 
<br/>medical tests, number of dental feelings, number of dental extractions per patients per day.  This will 
<br/>mean  patients  may  have  to  make  several  visits  to  complete  their  treatment.  Loss  of  productivity 
<br/>regarding  time.  Excessive  sick  leave  away  from  work  and  limiting  the  doctor’s  ability  to  fully 
<br/>investigate the presenting symptoms before making definitive diagnosis on the presenting complaint 
<br/>by the patient because of the limited tests that they have to put in place.  And to be able to provide 
<br/>the best treatment for Fijians, this Budget does not address that issued. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Health  Care  Scheme  has  opened  opportunities  for  entrepreneurship. 
<br/>Recently, we noticed that the honourable Minister of Finance was a chief guest at the opening of a 
<br/>new medical clinic and pharmacy belonging to a young couple in Nakasi, praising and congratulating 
<br/>them for taking on the initiative under the SMEs to enter that space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the demand for high revenue through VAT collection will obviously place an 
<br/>immense pressure also on the FRCS team. One only wonders the timing of the resignation of the 
<br/>former CEO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health  and Medical  Services is  allocated a total  of $453.7 million  in this 
<br/>financial  year,  comprising  of  $388.6  in  operating  expenditure  and  only  $39.6  million  in  capital 
<br/>expenditure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, how is the Budget fair and just, or balanced as they like to call it?  With a mere 
<br/></span><span>increase of social benefit allowance on one hand and directly reaching into the pocket of the lower 
<br/></span><span>income and middle earners, together with the destitute recipient to pay 15 percent VAT in almost 
<br/>everything they need to buy or the services that will be provided to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition needs to improve and strengthen awareness on healthy behaviour and our health 
<br/>budget  needs  to  be  boosted  in  the  Public  Health  SEG  other  than  being  slashed.  It  is  too  early  to 
<br/>remove the whole COVID-19 allocation from the Public Health allocation entirely.  This is my view, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker. It can be kept under R as COVID-19 is unlikely to go away completely.  There are still 
<br/>many unknown variables that are sticking around. It may end up reappearing seasonally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in addition to this recommendation, we are being advised that the  </span><span>El Nino</span><span> is 
<br/>forecasted  for  this  year.    We  brace  for  severe  drought,  associated  food  insecurity,  flooding,  rain, 
<br/>temperature  rise  due  to  the  effects  of  </span><span>El  Nino</span><span>.  This  will  cause  a  wide  range  of  health  problems, 
<br/>including disease outbreak, malnutrition, heat stress and respiratory diseases.  My question to the 
<br/>Government, are we financially ready for the devastating </span><span>El Nino</span><span> effects? I do not see that in this 
<br/>Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  our  Public  Health  team  to  go  out  into  villages,  settlements  and  populated 
<br/>communities  with  health  promotion  message  and  that  is  the  mission  of  the  Ministry  of  Health, 
<br/>“Empowering all Fijians to take care of their own health”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Fiji Health Care Reform involved the creative of innovative solution that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>every Fijian is cared for are being heavily subsidised by the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  do  have  a  very  robust  healthcare  system  put  in  place  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  and  there  is  no  doubt  about  that.    Through  the  FijiFirst  innovative  initiatives,  Fiji’s 
<br/>Tertiary Care is excellent and is the best in the region at the moment and we designed our system to 
<br/>do  that.    Today,  open-heart  surgery,  overseas  standard  specialty  care  is  now  done  locally.    A 
<br/>substantives savings and peace of mind for our family as patients are no longer relocated to India or 
<br/>elsewhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just last week, honourable Kiran, our honourable Prime Minister opened a 100-bed hospital, 
<br/>the Pacific Health Specialist (PHS) Hospital in Nadi. Yes, it is a private hospital, it is a pride of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Makoi Birthing Unit, taking the load off CWMH; the new Navosa Hospital, this is 
<br/>forward  thinking  and  strategically  located  for  new  economic  development  in  the  highlands.  This 
<br/>morning, we heard the honourable Minister from the other side that Navatumali will be a hub for 
<br/>economic  activity  up  in  the  Navosa  region.    The  new  Nakasi  Health  Centre,  the  Namarai  Health 
<br/>Centre in Ra, Waimaro Hospital in Naitasiri, Magodro Mortuary in Bukuya, Black Rock Military 
<br/>Academy in Votualevu.  I noted that the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services has 
<br/>plans for the maintenance of clinics and staff accommodation where applicable. I applaud his plans 
<br/>and I wish the Ministry well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, several nursing stations have been converted to health centre 
<br/>level  under  the  FijiFirst  Administration,  so  that  ordinary  Fijians  living  in  most  remote  areas  can 
<br/>access quality healthcare from a fully qualified doctor, as compared to a nurse with his or her limited 
<br/>clinical scope. Now with this FijiFirst arrangement, Fijians do not have to travel far to see a doctor 
<br/>and that is a direct saving on their families.  I have listed the nursing stations that have been upgraded 
<br/>to health centre level - Tau, Nawaicoba, Naqalimare, Waivaka, Lomaivuna, Laselevu, Dawasamu, 
<br/>Kubulau, Bouma in the Garden Island of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another blow to our low-income earners, amongst others, is that under this 
<br/></span><span>Budget, the free General Practitioner (GP) Scheme which the FijiFirst Government initiated will now 
<br/></span><span>be  means-tested.    Under  this  Budget,  family  that  earns  more  than  $30,000  combined  household 
<br/>income in a year will no longer be eligible to get this free GP or Dental Practitioner (DP) services 
<br/>under  the  healthcare  scheme.    While  I  oppose  this  arrangement,  the  Government  should  have 
<br/>formulated a better monitoring and evaluation tool on the Scheme without causing pain on the poor 
<br/>ordinary Fijians.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1281 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mt. Speaker, Sir, the Word Health Organization (WHO) does not measure the quality of the 
<br/>healthcare system, it ranks systems that treat people equally higher than those that treat patients well.  
<br/>That is where investment in Public Private Partnership (PPP) is important.  Under that arrangement, 
<br/>Fijians  are  equally  treated  effectively,  efficiently  and  in  an  accredited  medical  and  dental  setting 
<br/>approved by the Medical and Dental Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the pay increase for nurses is much welcome, as being announced, 
<br/>the absence of the same for the rest of the health staff will only demoralise the rest of the healthcare 
<br/>cadre.  There are issues in the discrepancy of salary of Senior Paramedical Officers compared to the 
<br/>new graduates.  For example, a 15-year experienced staff will only be on Step 2 while a new graduate 
<br/>comes in at Step 1 in the salary band.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me remind the honourable Minister of Finance that hospital services are 
<br/>not  run  by  doctors  and  nurses  only.    We  have  pharmacists,  medial  scientists,  X-ray  technicians, 
<br/>dieticians, physiotherapists, Environmental Health Inspectors, Oral Health Practitioners, who are part 
<br/>of whole holistic health profession.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of these healthcare staff are already on a lower salary band.  We have noted that the Job 
<br/>Evaluation Exercise being mentioned, along with this Budget, we need a timeline Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>as staff continue to migrate due to salary and other factors as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to inform Parliament about the services provided at the CWMH 
<br/>Oral Surgery Unit. This may be the first time, but this speciality care has evolved enormously in the 
<br/>past eight years. In terms of its specific advancement in the clinical scope and the mentoring of Junior 
<br/>Dental Officers in the Oral Surgery Unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Oral Surgery Team receives one to two oral cancer patients every week 
<br/>to treat. While for decades we focus on NCDs, the incidence of oral cancer in Fiji is also on the rise.  
<br/>In fact, it is more or equal to Sri Lanka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  postgraduate  training  available  locally.    The  College  of  Medicine,  Nursing  and 
<br/>Health Sciences for masters of Oral Surgery.  The graduates from this programme, a few of them 
<br/>have already graduated, are now treating oral cancer, jaw cysts and the enormous number of soft 
<br/>tissue traumas due to increase in domestic violence, alcohol related jaw injuries and motor vehicle 
<br/>accident.  They are very much part of the Clinical Care Committee at the two major hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I humbly request the honourable Minister for Health, who is not here now, 
<br/>to  look  at  the  salary  disparity  for  these  Oral  Surgeons.    Their  salary  needs  to  be  aligned  to  the 
<br/>specialist care they perform with lots of dedication and passion over the years. The Unit needs to be 
<br/>further supported and developed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me speak briefly on the Department of Radiology. If I may, now we have 
<br/>only one floor mounted digital x-ray machine, one MRI machine and one CT scan machine in the 
<br/>country at CWM Hospital – only one of each of three Units at the moment.  These machines which 
<br/>are all radiology resources are stretched to the limit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  MRI  machine  is  over  10  years  old.    A  financial  plan  needs  to  commence  for  the 
<br/>replacement of this machine, and I hope the honourable Minister will look into this. Also, if I may, 
<br/>there is  a software system  (PAC), a vital  tool for radiologists to  display, capture, store and share 
<br/>medical  images  in  the  fastest  and  most  reliable  way,  that  also  need  to  be  looked  into  and  to  be 
<br/>procurred. If I may share, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current practice now is the sharing of images through 
<br/>smart phone. The device is of a substandard service and can also cost lives.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  provide  some  feedback  on  some  of  the  issues  highlighted  this 
<br/>morning.  The health facilities have some minor defects.  On the Nakasi Health Centre, I was reliably 
<br/>informed  that  washroom  users  at  Nakasi  Health  Centre  at  times  use  thick  toilet  tissues  or  tissue 
<br/>papers, cloth, newspaper leaflets, et cetera, and this causes blockage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Navosa Subdivisional Hospital in Keiyasi, Mr. Speaker, equipment and beddings were 
<br/>relocated from  Ba Mission  Hospital  to  Keiyasi  Hospital.  It was  a prudent  inventory management 
<br/>decision, knowing fully well that the Ba Mission Hospital will be handed over to the Aspen Medical. 
<br/>It  is,  indeed,  timely,  as  confirmed  by  the  honourable  Minister  from  the  other  side  this  morning, 
<br/>Vatumali will develop to further become an economic hub for the people of Navosa and they have a 
<br/>big hospital there.  As we always say, this is a forward-looking infrastructure development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance mentioned about the laundry service at 
<br/>CWMH. For the information of Parliament, proper tender process was followed, tender was awarded 
<br/>to a company.  If the honourable Minister wants to know more about the boiler room, you can ask 
<br/>the honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Engineers report about the stabilisation of the land where ethe boiler is located at the 
<br/>moment.  If we were to look at demolishing this old boiler room, the old Children’s Hospital will just 
<br/>collapse.  Maybe,  the  honourable  Minister  Tuisawau  can  highlight  to  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  also  slipped  his  tongue  about  the  Levuka  Mortuary 
<br/>during  his  speech  on  Monday.  He  then  realised  that  it  got  compromised  during  their  term.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the morgue serves the whole of the Lomaiviti Medical Area which includes Koro, Gau, 
<br/>Batiki and Nairai, where the honourable Attorney-General comes from.  We feel that these islanders 
<br/>are being deprived of a proper farewell by their loved ones.  The practice of burying the corpse the 
<br/>same day is not only painful, but irresponsible of a Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to take urgent actions to address some 
<br/>of  the  challenges  highlighted  and  this  includes  increasing  the  health  budget,  investing  in  the  in-
<br/>service  training  and  retention  of  dedicated  outstanding  healthcare  professionals,  upgrading  and 
<br/>sustainable medical equipment. Our citizens deserve better, and it is our responsibility to advocate 
<br/>for a more equitable and efficient healthcare system for all Fijians.  Unfortunately, under this Budget, 
<br/>it will come at a heavy cost for ordinary Fijians.  May God help us!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  hope  that  we  can  learn  from  this  clone  budget  and  maybe  in  the  next 
<br/>budget, the honourable Minister of Finance can move away from a cut and paste which clearly this 
<br/>Budget is.  This is my contribution to the Budget and I thank you for the extended time given to me.  
<br/>I do not support this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  I.  TUIWAILEVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  2023-2024 
<br/>National Budget that was delivered by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.  Please

<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- In regards to the honourable Rinesh Sharma, he is currently editing his speech.  
<br/>His is trying to respond to some of the comments made by the honourable Ministers and Assistant 
<br/>Ministers.  He knew already at hand that he was going to speak last, he is now still editing some of 
<br/>the comments just to respond to some of the Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He is writing his speech, tell him to hurry up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- I received a note just a while ago from the Secretary-General and according 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the Order Paper, the honourable Rinesh is the last speaker for today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- According to the list that I have, it is honourable Ratu Isikeli Tuiwailevu, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Rinesh Sharma and the last one would be honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- The Batting Order for today, honourable Rinesh is the last speaker.  I was 
<br/>just notified about the change just a while ago.  I received a note from the Secretary-General and I 
<br/>could not confirm to the change because the honourable Rinesh is listed as the last speaker of today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It is not an excuse, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- It is in the Order Paper 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He should be ready.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I ask that honourable Ro Filipe takes the floor whilst hopefully honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rinesh will be the last speaker for the night. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion.    The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Members of Parliament, fellow 
<br/>Fijians, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the opportunity to address this august Parliament and 
<br/>elaborate more on the Budget allocation for the Ministry for Public Works, Meteorological Services 
<br/>and Transport.  I also acknowledge the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Professor Biman Prasad 
<br/>and his team and the Ministry for Finance for the hard work undertaken for the Budget outcome for 
<br/>2023-2024 and for producing the best Budget ever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear! Hear 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- At the outset I wanted to say the FijiFirst Government did not 
<br/>do justice to the Ministry I am in charge of and almost closed it down for not providing the necessary 
<br/>support needed by the Ministry to better support our rural and maritime islands.  I wish to say to the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition that this Ministry is important because it has the key sectors of the nation - infrastructure, 
<br/></span><span>roads, water, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is only through this Government that we will improve and better develop these sectors to 
<br/>lessen the load on our urban infrastructure.  It is only through the Coalition Government that we will 
<br/>better the services in the rural and maritime areas.  As announced by the Deputy Prime Minister and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister  of  Finance,  the  Public  Utilities,  Meteorology  Services  sectors  are  very  important  in  an 
<br/>economy and a small island developing state like ours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructures such as roads, bridges, ports, jetties are important in building a sustainable and 
<br/>resilient future.  The Ministry is now allocated a significant budget of more than $98 million with an 
<br/>inclusion  of  the  transport  sector.  This  is  significant  as  we  revive  the  work  of  the  Public  Works 
<br/>Department, strengthen our services through Water Authority of Fiji and enhance our connectivity 
<br/>in both land and maritime transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Utility sector or infrastructure sector consists mainly of public 
<br/>works, water, energy and roads in  Fiji  with  a budget  increase of more than 100 percent  from  the 
<br/>2022-2023  financial  year.  This  is  to  cater  mainly  for  development  and  enhancement  of  Fiji’s 
<br/>infrastructure in the rural and maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Energy, Fiji has embarked on three ambitious targets related to the energy 
<br/>sector, which is to achieve 100 percent electrification rate by 2026, increase our renewable energy 
<br/>mix for electricity generation to 100 percent by 2036, and to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 
<br/>2050.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government fully fathoms the important role energy plays towards economic and social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development and, therefore, remains steadfast in achieving this target.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in this financial year, there is an increase of $12 million to $14 million in the 
<br/>energy budget, mainly focusses on the implementation specifically increase to cater for Kadavu Koro 
<br/>Hydro and Grid Extension Projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has been working closely with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGI) and 
<br/>other institutions such as KOICA and JICA to secure for the funding. This is to further complement 
<br/>the budgetary allocation for the energy sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an area totally neglected by the FijiFirst Government, despite the many opportunities, 
<br/>and a result of total suppression of independence in the Civil Service during their 16-year rule which 
<br/>was basically a two-men government. Where are they, anyway? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  continue  to  work  in  partnership  with  other  Ministries, 
<br/>Departments,  communities and stakeholders to  lift the standards of infrastructure in  the rural  and 
<br/>maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry cannot overemphasise the need to enhance our rural and maritime infrastructure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to better our services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  notable  increase  in  the  Budget  includes  the  maintenance  and  refurbishment  of  public 
<br/>buildings, also including IT software and hardware, in order to improve monitoring and evaluation 
<br/>frameworks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, the Ministry was also currently working on a revised National 
<br/></span><span>Building  Code  that  will  standardise  the  state  of  our  buildings  and  better  align  towards  safety, 
<br/>particularly for national disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to this work and due to the disbanding of the Construction Implementation Unit 
<br/>(CIU),  the  Ministry  budget  is  strengthened  with  increased  manpower  to  cater  for  the  growing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="118">Page 118</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1287 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>demands of the work, particular the upgrading of quarters and office buildings in the three Divisions. 
<br/>The target is to expand the rural economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the CIU, let me share what one of the Audit Reports stated: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“To properly assess  and understand the nature and environment  in  which the 
<br/>CIU operate, we enquired whether there is a documented mandate or intent of the Unit 
<br/>which could be used as a reference point during audit.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, we inquire the Unit was required to process all government agencies construction 
<br/>projects.  However, we were not able to substantiate any documented mandate on intent of the Unit, 
<br/>except in the Ministry of Economy’s Strategic Plan that validates the existence of the CIU.  Similarly, 
<br/>we  are  not  able  to  substantiate  any  documented  requirement  that  obliges  the  Unit  to  process  all 
<br/>Government agencies and construction projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clearly this shows that the CIU was created by Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum for control purposes, that 
<br/>is, in disbanding the PWD, and to control the award of contracts and we know to who.  Of course, 
<br/>that created overnight millionaires. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to share the water issues. This is one of the challenging 
<br/>issues we face today and the services of wastewater in its current status requires the Government to 
<br/>address the issues with urgency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Failed water services is a legacy of the FijiFirst Government, despite 16 years of governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They did not solve the issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government, in the 2023-2024 Budget, is committed to achieve a 24/7 provision of water 
<br/>and wastewater services, and the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has been allocation a total budget 
<br/>of  $250.8  million  -  $118.1  million  for  Operational  Expenditure  and  $132.7  million  for  Capital 
<br/>Expenditure. This budgeted allocation is targeted towards the upgrading of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>WAF’s existing water and wastewater infrastructure to improve service sustainability through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an efficient and safe robust water supply system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of $53.8 million is allocated for the water programme. This includes water sources 
<br/>and distribution projects that covers the construction and installation of three package water treatment 
<br/>plants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, funds are also allocated for Water Treatment Plants in Nabouwalu and other 
<br/>centres.  The  Government  will  continue  its  efforts  to  connecting  villages  and  communities  living 
<br/>outside the Central Business District. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Water  Programme  Allocation  also  included  feasibility  study  of  new  potential  water 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sources in various locations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction  of  new  and  upgrading  old  reservoirs  in  areas  such  as  Sigatoka,  Tavua, 
<br/></span><span>Malaqereqere and Levuka pipeline works, in Savudrodro, maintenance and upgrading of pipelines 
<br/>from Sawani to Colo-i-Suva and also a dedicated 11-kilometre pipeline in the Central Division, in 
<br/>addition to others.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  water  loss  through  aging  pipe  network  is  a  key  issue  of  WAF.  The 
<br/>Government has, therefore, allocated $5.8 million to specifically address leakages or non-revenue 
<br/>water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Working  with  ADB  through  its  technical  assistance  programme,  a  non-revenue  water 
<br/>specialist  has  been  engaged  to  develop  a  performance-based  contract  for  now-revenue  water 
<br/>reduction within the Suva-Nausori, Nadi-Lautoka Water Supply Systems.  Further, $7.5 million is 
<br/>allocated for the implementation of integrated meter management to improve meter reading accuracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Wastewater Programme has an allocation of $6.4 million to increase system performance 
<br/>by improving wastewater operations of WAF’s Wastewater Network and Pump Stations.  In addition, 
<br/>WAF has allocated $4.9 million towards developing and implementing a robust asset management 
<br/>programme which has been the subject of the past Audit reports. So, we can also achieve a lot by 
<br/>using  the  latest  and  proven  technology,  which  is  why  WAF  is  also  engaging  on  a  Digital 
<br/>Transformation journey and this programme has been allocated $4.6 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also the Suva Automation Strategy which will be implemented whereby WAF plans 
<br/>to automate one of its daily operations which sometimes causes water supply disruptions in the Suva–
<br/>Nausori corridor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  as  mentioned  by  the  Opposition,  we  also  have  the  Rewa  River  Water  Supply 
<br/>Scheme Project which is currently underway and due to come online towards July, October and, of 
<br/>course, as a responsible Government, we are committed to seeing this project through and complete 
<br/>it on time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has taken progressive steps to ensure that the citizens of 
<br/>Fiji do not face the same situation again, and we continue with our bold water plans, especially after 
<br/>the  development  of  the  Water  Sector  Strategy  2050  Plan  which  ensures  the  participation  of  all 
<br/>stakeholders and that we have clear plans and strategies in front of us as we move forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transportation is the backbone of any thriving economy. It enables the efficient movement 
<br/>of people and goods and facilitates trade and commerce.  In this regards, Sir, I address the Fiji Roads 
<br/>Authority (FRA).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  roads  and  highways,  enabling  the  seamless  movement  of  people,  it  is  a  critical 
<br/>organisation.    It  has  been  allocated  a  budget  of  more  than  $300  million  to  cater  for  maintaining, 
<br/>planning and delivering Fiji’s Road Network.  With the new Board in place, we look forward to a 
<br/>more cost effective and manageable services provided by FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  key  goals  of  the  FRA  Strategy  in  the  implementation  of  its  2023-2024  budget  is  to 
<br/>efficiently and sustainably provide a National Road Network Infrastructure that is affordable, safe 
<br/>and environment friendly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  recognises  the  vital  importance  of  a  well-developed  and  efficient  road 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>network, just as the last Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  FRA  Board  has  been  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  in  planning  the 
<br/>establishment of the Public Works Department and its associated works in the rural and maritime 
<br/>areas.  The two will complement each other, unlike under FijiFirst where Fiji Roads had divided the 
<br/>roads  in  Fiji  in  FRA  and  non-FRA  roads,  resulting  in  most  of  our  rural  communities,  villages, 
<br/>institutions  such  are  schools  and  public  buildings,  farms  and  others  being  marginalised  and 
<br/>discriminated against, as far as road maintenance was concerned. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Totally neglected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Focus will be centred also on the future maintenance contracts 
<br/>and  other  procurement  modalities  that  will  enable  rural  and  local  communities  or  contractors  to 
<br/>successfully acquire tender awards in their localities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is faced with the deteriorating road safety situation, which is a critical challenge.  One of 
<br/>the key efforts has been to acquire fiscal and financial resources to restore the conditions, despite the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government expending the budget at the point of six months in December 2022.  This has 
<br/>been a challenge and a direct result of vote buying by FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  The  FRA  is  currently  undertaking  its  task  to  develop  its 
<br/>strategic plans for the next five to ten years. Unfortunately, there was no strategic plan within FRA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  have  been  also  issues  regarding  the  implementation  of  projects  and  monitoring  and 
<br/>evaluation as such.  FRA has engaged the Office of the Auditor-General to conduct an independent 
<br/>financial audit in the management of its finances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  technical  audit  will  also  be  conducted  on  the  procurement  and  management  of  certain 
<br/>contracts  that  have  been  ongoing  and  awarded  in  the  recent  past.    This  will  also  be  part  of  the 
<br/>restructure programme.  But some in the Opposition may be asking, why are you doing this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I refer to past Audit Reports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and in one of the Audit Reports in terms of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>road construction in Nadi from the Airport, it stated and let me read that out: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Urban designing features and landscaping were important components of the 
<br/>works.  The  tender  was  awarded  to  the  contractor  for  a  sum  of  $65.9  million.    The 
<br/>contract agreement in the Bill of Quantities included $5.8 million for landscaping and 
<br/>design.  It was noted that the authority paid an additional $623,000 for its beautification 
<br/>project  to  other  contractors  without  calling  for  tender.    The  Authority  purchased 
<br/>bougainvillea plants which were not initially planned to be part of the landscaping.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  maintain  (this  is  Auditor-General)  that  the  tenders  were  not  called  for 
<br/>beautification projects and obtaining retrospective approval does not validate the non-
<br/>compliance.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this is just one of the which was in the Audit Report but which we are also going through at the 
<br/>moment. For that, the original contract sum of $65 million and the final sum ended up $116 million, 
<br/>a difference of $50.9 million. So, those are some of the challenges I wanted to share today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  current  Queen  Elizabeth  Drive  Project,  again,  original  contract  sum  of  $61.9  million.  
<br/>There have been claims of variations and we are looking at a final sum of $73 million but the Board 
<br/>is currently scrutinising all variations to-date and, of course, looking back and conducting its own, 
<br/></span><span>as I have mentioned, technical and financial audit   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue or point raised was on the ADB Project. This was also raised in Parliament. 
<br/>The Authority had prepared a contract agreement regarding the Suva Arterial Roads Upgrading but 
<br/>ADB had stated a mis-procurement. as some amendments were made to the original clauses.  Without 
<br/>approval,  consequently  ADB  terminated  the  funding  which  resulted  in  the  Authority  bearing  the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibility to meeting the total cost, totalling $30.4 million. Again, missed opportunity cost and 
<br/>just a few of the issues that we will need to look into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Foster  Road  Project,  Walu  Bay,  currently  contracted  sum  of  $31  million,  we  are 
<br/>looking into an additional $3 million at the moment, to read $34 million.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are 
<br/>some of the challenges faced within the Ministry as we try to move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me address some of the issues raised by the Opposition, I note my colleague, honourable 
<br/>Koya, had mentioned that the people are plagued by fear. Sir, I am not sure what that statement means 
<br/>and one of the terms used was ethnonationalism.  Again, as mentioned by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Home Affairs and Immigration, this is an issue that we are emphasising to the Opposition to be 
<br/>careful with in how we move forward and to exercise caution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I also note honourable Bala mentioning that it is a first-year Economics Student Budget.  
<br/>Please, read the title here, Professor Biman Prasad.  Let me remind you, please, give respect to where 
<br/>it is due.  I would like to thank the honourable Naisa Tuinaceva for sharing issues regarding LTA 
<br/>which is critical as we move forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On traffic congestion, the original plans were to construct two lane highways from Nausori 
<br/>right up to the end of Vatuwaqa Road.  Unfortunately, some of these were diverted to the Queen 
<br/>Elizabeth Drive and, again, it is wrong priority.  How many vehicles travel on Queen Elizabeth Drive 
<br/>in comparison to the Suva-Nausori corridor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has also been condemnation of PWD as duplicating, again, as I have mentioned, PWD 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will complement FRA and we will be looking at roads which are not currently covered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, let me end by also responding to honourable Ketan Lal.  I know that we had engaged in 
<br/>a friendly discussion this morning to resolve but in terms of the 2013 Constitution, let me remind 
<br/>you that it followed the process which was different from the 1990s and 1997 Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If your read back, you will understand which process is more valid.  The 1997 Constitution 
<br/>process is more valid, and we need to work together to follow that process again which is very, very 
<br/>critical.  You will agree that we need to reform the electoral system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  It’s a mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- When you look at the number of votes, nearly 80 percent of 
<br/>the votes is taken out by Mr. Bainimarama and Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum, so only 20 percent of the votes 
<br/>is sitting here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, your argument that you represent the number of votes you are saying, is invalid.  It does not hold 
<br/>any water.  So, it is in your interest that we engage in bipartisanship … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Follow the Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- …to review that.  Then you will have a better chance to beat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us in the next Election.  At the moment, you have zero chance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Niudamu, thank you for your comments.  He acknowledged the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and</span><span> Turaga ni Yavusa </span><span>allowances that we are increasing.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last Parliament, we brought the motion in here five times, and it was rejected.  Let me 
<br/>just share with you the issue.  I am thankful that you wanted another increase but, unfortunately, due 
<br/>to the huge debt, we cannot do that, and we will need to wait until the economy recovers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I support the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have seen that the honourable Rinesh Sharma has just walked in but  I 
<br/>have  already  had  discussions  with  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    First  of  all,  I  must 
<br/>apologise for the mix up - two sets of Batting Orders are here with me.  So, I have decided to move 
<br/>you to tomorrow so you will be listed for tomorrow, together with few others who are yet to deliver 
<br/>their contribution to the Budget.  So, I apologise for that, honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, honourable Members, that brings us to the end of today’s deliberations.  I thank the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of the Opposition, for bearing with 
<br/>the long sitting hours, but this is part of the debate on the Budget.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank you and we look forward to tomorrow’s meeting and to listen to honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rinesh Sharma making his contribution tomorrow.  At this juncture, I wish to adjourn Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>T</span><span>ranslation of the Honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage 
<br/>and Arts’ iTaukei speech in reply to the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 (Ref:  Page 1282-
<br/>1285) 
<br/></span><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  I.  TUIWAILEVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament.  </span><span>Miau sa bula re. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise to speak in support of the 2023-2024 Budget as delivered by the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and I want to congratulate him and his team for formulating 
<br/>a Budget that is quickly gaining acceptance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My statement today will mostly touch on language and culture, a core mandate of my Ministry. 
<br/>This year, the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts was transferred to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/>The  Ministry  already  hosts  the  iTaukei  Institute  of  Language  and  Culture.    Aligning  itself  with  the 
<br/>outcome  of  the  GCC  meeting  this  year  as  endorsed  by  Cabinet,  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs, 
<br/>Culture, Heritage and Arts is advocating culture as a driver and enabler of sustainable development.  
<br/>Indeed, culture is a development issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The economic empowerment of the iTaukei is now the underlying economic philosophy of 
<br/>the iTaukei. This is intended to improve livelihood and address the poverty rate with a particular 
<br/>emphasis on the marginalized. In this regard, culture will play a critical role.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua  </span><span>governance  will  also  be  strengthened.  Integral  to  </span><span>vanua</span><span>  governance  is  culture  – 
<br/>revitalising and safeguarding it is vital. The scale of the issues affecting the iTaukei today raises fresh 
<br/>issues about language and culture. These create unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Culture 
<br/>is a cross-cutting issue as articulated in the 2030 Agenda and the Pacific Regional Cultural Strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the total budget for Culture and Language is $7.2 million. This is 18.6 percent 
<br/>of our total budget. This is very significant increase and I again thank the honourable Professor Biman 
<br/>Prasad for his generosity. While countries have committed to setting aside 1-2 percent of their budget 
<br/>to culture, Fiji has done very well. This budget will cater for all cultural groups in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am really excited to be at the helm of the Ministry leadership with the able leadership of the 
<br/>honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage &amp; Arts. The increase will allow for the 
<br/>better coordination of the sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet  endorsed  Fiji’s  National  Culture  policy  in  May  2023.  We  will  ensure  that 
<br/>stakeholders  are  made  aware  of  the  Policy.  Implementation  will  be  woven  into  the  work  of  the 
<br/>relevant cultural agencies and stakeholders in the next 10 years. This is to ensure that key priorities 
<br/>and objectives are achieved. The new budget will fund the implementation of the policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  also  glad  to  highlight  the  continuation  of  the  Fiji  Government’s  commitment  to  the 
<br/></span><span>rehabilitation  work  and  the  funding  towards  the UNESCO  World  Heritage  Port  Town  of  Levuka 
<br/>which is Fiji’s only UNESCO World Heritage Site. For 2023-2024 Budget, the Fiji Government has   
<br/>continued  to  show  its  commitment  and  its  obligation  to  the  1972  UNESCO  World  Heritage 
<br/>Convention by giving the $1.5million to ensure that the proper completion of the Levuka Community 
<br/>Centre.
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="125">Page 125</a></div>
<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The newly rehabilitated Levuka Community Centre World Heritage Structure once completed 
<br/>will be an historic and iconic center for the people of Levuka and Lomaiviti Group. It will house a 
<br/>museum,  community  center,  library,  children’s  play  center  and  a  coffee  shop.  This  will  generate 
<br/>economic activities in Levuka Town and will help in the education of the future generation of Levuka. 
<br/>In addition, I am glad that the government has also provided funding for the Preservation of Historical 
<br/>Monuments  in  the  Levuka  Town  to  help  in  the  maintenance  of  the  historical,  authenticity  and 
<br/>integrity of the World Heritage Site in Levuka.

<div><span>The Budget will fund the continuous development of the Cultural &amp; Creative Industry in Fiji. 
<br/>Fijian artists, crafters, weavers and carvers have made creative and innovative ideas for the artists 
<br/>using their wealth of cultural knowledge to earn their living and improve their livelihoods in their 
<br/>different  communities.  In  the  new  financial  year,  the  Ministry  is  earmarked  to  develop  relevant 
<br/>strategies and plans with the relevant stakeholders to ensure the cultural &amp; creative industry benefit 
<br/>the local artists and entrepreneurs in Fiji. Supporting the Cultural &amp; Creative Industry will also bring 
<br/>about economic benefits to the Fijian economy as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  development  of  Fiji’s  Cultural  Statistic 
<br/>Framework  to  help  the  Culture,  Heritage  &amp;  Arts  Sector  consolidate  its  statistics  from  different 
<br/>cultural  agencies and stakeholders. While it will encourage artists to  be creative, we also  need to 
<br/>ensure that the intangible cultural heritage, knowledge and skills are protected and not over-exploited 
<br/>by our local people, business and international markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the new financial year, the Ministry will work with our Cultural  Stakeholders to ensure 
<br/>there is a Culture &amp; Education Strategy to help Fijian Government in promotion of social cohesion 
<br/>and national unity amongst the people that had called Fiji home. The strategy will also lay foundation 
<br/>for  government  to  work  with  relevant  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  culture,  heritage  &amp;  arts  are 
<br/>transmitted from the older generation to the younger ones in the schools, communities and homes. 
<br/>The strategy will suggest ways and means to integrate ICT to ensure that it helps promote culture, 
<br/>heritage and different art forms to our youth and younger generations so that they are aware and be 
<br/>proud of their own culture and identity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this new Budget, it is also encouraging to see that the Fiji Government has also continued 
<br/>to increase the funding for the Fiji Museum to ensure that the cultural heritage artefacts are stored 
<br/>safely and the proper managements and operation of the Fiji Museum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of safeguarding and the management of National Heritage Sites in Fiji, the Ministry 
<br/>will work with relevant statutory bodies like the National Trust of Fiji to provide grants in managing 
<br/>our National Heritage Sites around Fiji as mandated in the National Trust of Fiji Act. I believe the 
<br/>Grants provided to the cultural and natural heritage institutions as such will ensure the Heritage sites 
<br/>in Fiji continue to be recognized and protected by the Fiji Government and also be recognized as it 
<br/>is also a habitat for Fiji’s well-known flora and fauna. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to work with the relevant stakeholders in the Art Sector to help 
<br/>promote our culture and arts through the work of the Fiji Arts Council. I am happy to say that the 
<br/>new Board has also been appointed to look into the development of the Art Sector in Fiji for this new 
<br/></span><span>financial year and beyond through its new developed Fiji Arts Council Strategic Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am happy to highlight today that the Coalition Government has also recognized the need to 
<br/>enhance  the  Art  Sector  by  providing  $100,000.    This  is  to  undertake  the  feasibility  study  for  the 
<br/>National Art Gallery to ensure that our Fijian Artists talents are showcased are properly housed at 
<br/>the National Art Gallery once the building is completed.
