<h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3>
<div><span>POINT OF ORDER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Breach of Standing Orders – Hon. Ketan Lal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I rise on a Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 
<br/>62(1), 62(4)(a) and (d).  Under Standing Order 62(1), I raise a Point of Order against honourable 
<br/>Ketan Lal for imputing an improper motive against another Member of Parliament, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, by imputing that is because of the honourable Prime Minister, there is a rise in crime 
<br/>rate  in  this  country  without  providing  any  evidence  or  statistics  to  connect  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister to the rise in crime rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Standing Order 62(4)(a) and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is out of order for a member, when speaking, to use –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>offensive words against Parliament or another member.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Lal  had  stated  offensive  words  against  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  by 
<br/>referring to his age, that he is not fit to lead, and told him to go out.  That is discrimination, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, just to speak about age alone and to pick on the honourable Prime Minister about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will quote Standing Order 62(4)(d), as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is out of order for a member, when speaking, to use - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)  words  that  are  likely  to  promote  or  provoke  feelings  of  ill  will  or  hostility  between 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities or ethnic groups within Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Lal referred to the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span> for no other reason than to raise 
<br/>the issue or to attack race relations in Fiji.  Yesterday, not one honourable Member from this side of 
<br/>Parliament attacked the former Prime Minister or mentioned about the 2006 </span><span>coup.  </span><span>In fact, it was the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition who volunteered that information because it is the aim of the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  and  I  would  like  to  think  the  whole  Parliament,  is  to  bring  national 
<br/></span><span>reconciliation and unity into this Parliament and to this country.  If there is for no other reason but to 
<br/></span><span>raise  that  issue  alone  by  itself,  under  Standing  Order  62(4)(d),  they  are  words  that  are  likely  to 
<br/>promote ill-will and feelings amongst our ethnic groups in Fiji.  I raise my points under the Standing 
<br/>Order for the honourable Parliament to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are on the verge of confirming the Minutes of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>yesterday’s meeting.  In the process, this has now been raised by the honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1173 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  in  Parliament.  So,  in  effect,  what  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament is putting forward is for us to look at the Standing Orders, maybe the Minutes highlighting 
<br/>this particular incident could be expunged from the Minutes that we are about to confirm.  It is quite 
<br/>a sticky issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Speaker, I do not blame honourable Ketan for the outburst he made yesterday.  We, as part 
<br/>of the Secretariat, find that we are falling short of addressing this very critical issue of the role of 
<br/>MPs in a workshop that should have been undertaken, where new Members are slowly shown the 
<br/>rope as to how to behave and lead themselves in this august Parliament.  It is not an easy process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Orders raised by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament is one 
<br/>that should have been raised when the incident occurred.  We are not far off, just couple of hours 
<br/>when that happened at about quarter past nine last evening.  I did sound a cautious remark in this 
<br/>august Parliament by asking each and every honourable Member to please, try and observe a lot of 
<br/>respect  in  this  august  Parliament  so  that  we  can  maintain  and  properly  ensure  the  decorum  of 
<br/>Parliament  is  well  protected  -  how  you  speak,  let  alone  how  you  dress  to  come  into  this  august 
<br/>Parliament and how you address your honourable colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are all equal here, honourable Members.  What the Standing Orders entail is something 
<br/>that  will  lead  up  to  privilege.    I  am  not  trying  to  curtail  the  way  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Government in Parliament is trying to address this by raising that Point of Order, but before we go 
<br/>any  further,  I  would  like  to  move  to  the  floor  of  Parliament  for  the  sake  of  addressing  this  very 
<br/>important  issue that we  try and observe Standing Order 6  – Suspension of Standing Orders  for a 
<br/>couple of minutes.  Let us discuss this.  Let us thrash it out amicably and amongst ourselves as to 
<br/>how to address this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  no  use  referring  it  to  the  Privileges  Committee  for  the  sake  of  addressing  this  very 
<br/>important issue, that we try and observe Standing Order 6.  We suspend Standing Order for a couple 
<br/>of minutes and let us discuss this, let us thrash it out amicably and amongst ourselves as to how to 
<br/>address this.  It is no use referring it to the Privileges Committee because we have not had a chance 
<br/>to discuss this amongst ourselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Ketan  Lal  is  a  young  and  vibrant  Member  of  Parliament,  he  hails  from 
<br/>Savusavu.  That affects me in my traditional role as well, but be that as it may, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Government in Parliament, perhaps if you may move Standing Order 6 so that we can suspend 
<br/>Standing Orders and we give ourselves about 30 minutes, let us debate this very well so this does not 
<br/>happen again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the absence of the workshop that we are supposed to have, may I add a little bit on that?  
<br/>We are being provided money by overseas donors especially the Government of Japan where the 
<br/>money has been funneled to the United Nations because they keep a watch and help us a lot in our 
<br/>training to become better Members of Parliament and better persons in Parliament and how we could 
<br/>effectively undertake our role as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the cost of providing this, I raised with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister yesterday 
<br/></span><span>is beyond what they have budgeted for and as such that may not happen, but this has erupted. And if 
<br/></span><span>that is accepted by the honorable Leader of the Government in Parliament then I suggest that we go 
<br/>first to suspending Standing Orders so that we can make an attempt instead of referring everything 
<br/>to the Privileges Committee.  Let us try and resort this and discuss it, after 30 minutes we resume 
<br/>again like they do in the United Nations and let us continue the daily duty that we are required to 
<br/>undertake as already approved by the Business Committee for the Standing Orders for today.

<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move under Standing Order 6 that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Orders be suspended in part by leave of Parliament so as to discuss the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>matter that is before Parliament that is being raised myself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Hobourable Members, is there any opposition? There being no opposition, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion is carried and  Parliament is suspended for 30 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a rare thing to occur, we usually suspend Standing Orders for 51 to kick-in everytime, 
<br/>but here we are suspending Standing Orders so that we may freely discuss this.  I am not trying to 
<br/>defend the honourable Member here but given that we have not had a chance to properly induct our 
<br/>new  honourable  Members  into  this  august  Parliament  and  the  etiquette  that  goes  with  it  plus  the 
<br/>protoc, the floor is now open for debate.  The honourable Prime Minister, you were the so-called 
<br/>victim here because of the way he made his statement yesterday but I did sound out a cautious advice 
<br/>yesterday evening before we rose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was the subject of the attack, I think I should  
<br/>have a chance to speak.  I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have not had that workshop, nor had 
<br/>we had the workshop before the suspension of the former Leader of the Opposition.  It was sort of 
<br/>understood that as we stood for Elections to represent people who voted for us, we would have that 
<br/>good  sense,  maturity  and  wisdom  to  be  able  to  conduct  ourselves  in  this  august  Parliament  in  a 
<br/>manner in keeping with the status, reputation and the history of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I sat and listened to the honourable Member last night and I could not interject, I did not want 
<br/>to respond. It was still the first six months of our term in Parliament and the only thing that concerned 
<br/>me was his refence to matters that I had apologized to the nation about. Many senior members of the 
<br/>Government  at  that  time  (1987)  and  senior  members  of  the  Indo-Fijian  communities  in  Fiji  have 
<br/>accepted my apologies and some later on have tried to ask me not to continue to apologize.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact that the honourable Member brought this up yesterday, perhaps shows the need for 
<br/>me to keep reminding people that there is a need to forgive and move forward and not to go back to 
<br/>things that bring back malice into our hearts and malicious words that perhaps we do not really mean 
<br/>but at the spur of the moment, the heat of the debate, it comes up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I only hope Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we can have that workshop soon, perhaps the honourable 
<br/>Members  of  the  Opposition  have  not  really  been  spoken  to  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition because yesterday most of them were referring to our leader and referring to a gentleman 
<br/>who was a former leader and no longer in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  hope  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  as  leader  of  their 
<br/>parliamentary group at the moment could, before the workshop, speak to the honourable Members 
<br/>of the Opposition and tell them what they are going to be hearing from the workshop anyway.  As 
<br/>far as I am concerned, I am not offended, I am used to it.  It has been almost 50 years of abuse and it 
<br/></span><span>is like water off a duck’s back.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  let  me  first  convey  on  behalf  of  the  Opposition 
<br/>Members  our  gratitude  and  I  acknowledge  you  for  your  wisdom  in  allowing  us  to  have  some 
<br/>discussions on this issue before we proceed with the Order of Business as already laid out and agreed 
<br/>by the Business Committee. Thank you, Sir, for allowing us to discuss this very important issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1175 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  first  of  all  again  assure  yourself,  Sir,  and  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament 
<br/>particularly on the Government side that I, as the Leader of the Opposition take full responsibility 
<br/>for the conduct of our Members inside in Parliament.  Once again, I take full responsibility for that, 
<br/>Sir.  Be assured that this morning when we had our caucus meeting at 8.30 a.m., although we were 
<br/>not all present, I am going to convene another meeting during lunch hour to address some of the key 
<br/>issues particularly with regards to the debate on the Budget and most particularly about the conduct 
<br/>in Parliament as well given your concluding remarks as we finished off yesterday’s session about 
<br/>decorum in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wish to assure you, Sir, and of course the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the  Government in Parliament, Cabinet Ministers and the Government side that I have raised the 
<br/>issue this morning with the Members of the Opposition about decorum and of course, the words that 
<br/>we use in Parliament as well to express our feelings, ideas and thoughts but we need to argue on facts 
<br/>and express ourselves in the proper context as well.  So, I wish again to assure you, Sir, that I have 
<br/>addressed that issue about the decorum in Parliament with the honourable Members of the Opposition 
<br/>this morning and I have also spoken to the honourable Ketan Lal. I intend to have another session 
<br/>with him probably later today just to guide him in certain aspects of his conduct inside Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you have alluded to, Mr. Speaker, Sir, young and vibrant and very enthusiastic about the 
<br/>issues, passionate as well, patriotic but proper guidance. We are here as mentors for the young and 
<br/>aspiring leaders and politicians who are coming up in the country and we want to raise and nurture 
<br/>them  to  be  good  leaders  to  take  over  the  baton  as  we  finish  from  here.    Huge  potentials  in  the 
<br/>honourable Member, and I hope that this will not proceed to the Privileges Committee, and we sort 
<br/>it out here in Parliament this morning and should Government think that certain or particularly on 
<br/>the areas referred to, be withdrawn from the Minutes of the sitting.  I probably can ask the honourable 
<br/>Member to  withdraw that portion that the honourable Leader of the Government  in  Parliament is 
<br/>referring to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But again, let me assure the august Chamber once again, Sir, that I take full responsibility and 
<br/>I have taken some actions this morning to address that.  This is why we need the training but while 
<br/>waiting for that, we will sort the matter out and ensure that there is proper conduct in this august 
<br/>Parliament.  That very briefly is my contribution.  As I have stated, I have taken some responsibilities 
<br/>already and we will be receptive to suggestions from the Government side so that this can be sorted 
<br/>this morning, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I called the honourable Prime Minister last 
<br/>night  when  we  finished  from  here  just  to  apologise  to  him  because  what  was  said  last  night  by 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal was not only disgraceful, it was in bad taste, it was designed to fan further 
<br/>racial ill will and hostility between the communities. As the honourable Prime Minister said himself, 
<br/>I was around, say in 1987, and had started my work. I was probably younger than honourable Ketan 
<br/>Lal  and  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma.  We  know  what  happened.  We  have  history.  We  saw  what 
<br/>happened since 1987. We saw honourable Prime Minister over those many years.  We saw when he 
<br/>was Prime Minister. We saw when he led this country into a process of reconciliation and formulation 
<br/>of the 1997 Constitution.  The 1990 Constitution, Sir, was imposed on us under which the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister  was  the  Prime  Minister.  He  had  no  reason.  He  had  the  majority  to  change  that 
<br/></span><span>Constitution. That was a landmark historical, leadership shown by the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition very much for stating what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he had stated, taking the responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in this august Chamber in the past, we have suspended Members of Parliament 
<br/>when  I  was  in  Opposition  for  statements  much  less  hostile  than  what  was  uttered  by  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>1176 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ketan Lal.  In fact, in the last sitting of Parliament when he spoke, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was tempted 
<br/>to refer him to the Privileges Committee then, if you look at the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>and the speech that 
<br/>he made.  Sir, as you quite rightly pointed out, I know him. He once used to be a very strong National 
<br/>Federation Party supporter. I do not know what happened.  He moved to some people, he became 
<br/>FijiFirst. He is a Member of Parliament. I respect him and as the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>said, I myself was an activist during 1987 and beyond that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We like young people to be in Parliament to contribute and we want them to grow outside the 
<br/>shadows of some others, but what I heard yesterday, not only from him, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but from 
<br/>some  others  as  well  were  some  disgraceful  personal  attacks,  attacks  on  the  family.    I  sat  on  the 
<br/>Opposition, Sir, for eight years.  Never once I attacked the honourable Members’ families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In politics, Sir, in this day and age, the families have a lot of burden on them.  When you 
<br/>make those kind of statements as was made by him, I do not mind, Sir.  I always remember Winston 
<br/>Churchill’s famous saying where he said that you will never reach your destination if you stop and 
<br/>throw stones at every dog that barks.  I always tell myself and I accept what people say about me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think if this matter is not to go to the Privileges Committee, then honourable Ketan Lal must 
<br/>unreservedly apologise to the honourable Prime Minister and give an undertaking that he will not 
<br/>repeat,  not  only  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  but  to  other  honourable  Members  on  the 
<br/>Government side, or even with his own colleagues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were other things said by other Members yesterday, those who 
<br/>are experienced, we will deal with that separately, but on this, I accept your very wise intervention 
<br/>and counsel in this matter.  I once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, apologise to the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>on behalf of whoever is there, if they are members of the Indo-Fijian community, in fact a lot of them 
<br/>called me last night and they were deeply disturbed by the way in which honourable Ketan Lal spoke 
<br/>and  spoke  disparagingly  not  only  about  the  Prime  Minister  calling  him  incompetent,  but  also 
<br/>invoking incidents (1987) to invoke racial hatred, racial ill-will and link it to crime and other things, 
<br/>when in fact, we should be hosing all those down in the social media that comes.  Otherwise, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we will be stuck.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Past is important, we look at history, it is important, we learn from history.  She is commenting 
<br/>but she also talks about 1987.  Already we are talking about how to get over it and here, she is still 
<br/>not  pleased  with  what  has  happened  and  that  is  the  arrogance  that  we  want  to  take  out  of  this 
<br/>Parliament.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are to move forward with this, then I move that we ask honourable 
<br/>Ketan Lal to apologise unreservedly and give an undertaking that he would not repeat this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must applaud the manner this is being addressed 
<br/>today.  Being a relatively new Parliament, we need to have this discussion and to set the standards 
<br/>that should be becoming of this august House in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tone has been set by the honourable Prime Minister from the beginning 
<br/>of the administration; a tone of humility, forgiveness and reconciliation to move forward.   Again, 
<br/>today he showed to us that, let us have this dialogue, let us agree on how to address these issues and 
<br/></span><span>move forward.  That is something that we must all celebrate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the young Members of Parliament, there is a line that you do not cross and that we must 
<br/>always remember that.  There are some of us who have sat in this Parliament for the last eight years, 
<br/>things got heated but we knew that you do not go beyond a certain line and those who did, were  
<br/>penalised.  We do not mind dialogue on policies, you can disagree with us, you can hit us, you can 
<br/>attack us on policies – no problems.  That is what we are here for, but one thing we must remember, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we must treasure the cosmopolitan and the heterogeneous make up of our country and that takes a 
<br/>lot of tender loving care and not to upset the equilibrium that we must keep every day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know we have made mistakes in the past, but we are a new generation.  This is a new Fiji 
<br/>and from this experience, let us move forward and make this Parliament the light that our people 
<br/>need to help navigate our way forward.  I would urge us all to please know the limits that are there, 
<br/>protect our Parliament and let us all move together as one people.  We do not mind any attack on our 
<br/>policies on what you believe in, but please let us keep it within the lines of civility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Since  we  are  talking  about  respect,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  actually  I 
<br/>wanted to meet you in person.  After my maiden speech, I had the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>“eye to eye” connection doing this to me.   I am a new Member of Parliament; see he is smiling.  Is 
<br/>this the respect you give the young ones?  I took all that night to prepare and then he says on national 
<br/>television, “oh, I know who wrote it for you”, as if we did not go to school or we were uneducated.  
<br/>How does it reflect on us?  He said it to a few other Members and this is just on the topic of respect 
<br/>and this is something I wanted to put before you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I think if we have a prolonged debate on this, there will be many 
<br/>things that will be raised with respect to the behaviour in this Parliament.  I believe that one of the 
<br/>most important weapons (if you want to put it that way) in an MPs arsenal is the right to freedom of 
<br/>speech.  I am not saying, I condone anything at the moment, but it is a right and a privilege given 
<br/>under Standing Order 133 with respect to every Member and any other person speaking in Parliament 
<br/>having the freedom of speech and debate, but it is subject to the Standing Orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within those Standing Orders, you, yourself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have the authority to actually 
<br/>do  something  about  it,  if  a  particular  Member  is  out  of  order  and  with  respect  to  his  disorderly 
<br/>conduct.  You can actually throw them out of Parliament, if I remember correctly, I think once or 
<br/>twice that has happened.   These Standing Orders actually contain a lot of powers that you have, Sir, 
<br/>with respect to dealing with these issues and I commend you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for letting us deal 
<br/>with this today.  All of us must remember that freedom of speech is not given lightly, we must be 
<br/>careful in how we use it.  I think both sides of Parliament have actually gone at each other’s throats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I could just relay a little story and historically, Sir, I am sure you will appreciate this and 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister.  It is a very private story, but I will say it.   As  you  know,  my  late 
<br/>father was on this side of Parliament, at that time the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was the Prime 
<br/>Minister, and I happened to be asked by him, after my father had passed away to go across and see 
<br/>him one day at the big white house.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had a very long conversation and he said to me, “My boy, remember your father and I 
<br/>used to go hammer and tongs at each other.  You will remember this, son.  No quarter given, but the 
<br/>minute we walked out that door, we would go to Fong Lee’s and have lunch.”  That is the spirit that 
<br/>everyone should have in this Parliament.  I practice the same, as a matter of fact, I spoke on that very 
<br/>same issue yesterday with the honourable Kamikamica.  That is how we should conduct ourselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> We must be mindful, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have a history, and I am sure the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister will agree that that is  part of history.   I am  not  saying  cross  the line and become 
<br/></span><span>offensive, but there are historical things that will be said, we cannot and must not, not talk about it.  
<br/>Our history is important, whether it be bad or good, and we must also remember that particular right 
<br/>of freedom of speech must be maintained at all times.  I understand his zeal, as you say rightfully, 
<br/>and his fervour, maybe it needs to be nurtured, I understand all of that.  However, we cannot use 
<br/>today’s platform to take it to another level where we are actually going to start feeling restrained in 
<br/>the way we are able to speak here.  I got out at hammer and tongs with honourable Professor Prasad,

<div><span>Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he does the same to me, but when I go outside that door, it is never personal.  None of us should ever 
<br/>do that.  In the words of the late Ratu Mara, Sir, “lunch at Fong Lee’s.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was the way that it was actually resolved.   I think the honourable Minister should shout 
<br/>him lunch at Fong Lee’s and maybe have chat about it later on.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the best 
<br/>thing for us to learn from this is, the honourable Leader of the Opposition said he will have a chat, I 
<br/>am sure we all will.  He is a young man.  There is no need to go any further with this, Sir, but we 
<br/>must  be  mindful  of  the  fact  that  these  particular  Standing  Orders  contain  the  right  to  freedom  of 
<br/>speech and it is very important and it is very important that we are, it is not an unfettered discretion.  
<br/>We must remember that, that we cannot do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we see, another occasion has been raised by t the young gentleman about honourable Prof.  
<br/>Prasad saying things to him.  We have all seen that.  Even yesterday we have seen him do that, but 
<br/>that is okay, it goes on.  He called someone a failed lawyer who cannot defend himself and he was 
<br/>not here yesterday but that is okay.  He does that.   It is just the way he projects himself.  But, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we must not cross the line and I am sure the honourable Prime Minister will understand 
<br/>that  historically  he  will  forever  be  hearing  this.    He  understands  that,  he  is  thick  skinned  and  he 
<br/>knows.  So, my point is, Sir, please let us not cross the line with respect to our privilege given to us 
<br/>within the Standing Orders of freedom of speech, but I am sure on this occasion, there will be a, as 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition has said, it is something that we will have to deal with and 
<br/>we can deal with it within ourselves.  I am grateful also to the Government for dealing with it in this 
<br/>particular manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think we have heard quite a lot just a while ago, 
<br/>having shared the same thoughts that we have as regards what we have before us.  We have heard 
<br/>from the honourable Leader of the Opposition, he is still to finish what he intends to do.  His had a 
<br/>few meetings and he still wants to continue, one with the honourable Ketan.  I understand where you 
<br/>are coming from, honourable Deputy Prime Minister Prasad, but it is that same respect that we would 
<br/>like  to  see.    We  leave  things  with  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  as  he  stated  in  this 
<br/>Parliament, that he still has a few more meetings.  One is with the honourable Ketan and the rest with 
<br/>the honourable Members of the Opposition Caucus before they will be able to take a position clearly 
<br/>as part of the Opposition on how they are going to be addressing this situation, and thereafter.  So, I 
<br/>beg your indulgence once more, honourable Members that we agree that we leave it entirely now to 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No. He is not going to say anything because he has not spoken with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already spoken with him 
<br/>this morning after the Caucus, but I want to again sit down with him so that we have more time on 
<br/>the subject.  I have spoken to him about it this morning and I have asked him if can also address 
<br/>Parliament on the issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You want him to address Parliament now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes, because I have already spoken to him this morning, but very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>briefly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-   Mr.  Speaker, Sir, the Leader of the  Opposition,  the  honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and  honourable Members of Parliament.  Democracy comes with a cost, and at this juncture,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communications from the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1179 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I withdraw my comments that have hurt the democracy of the country and at the same time promise 
<br/>that I will adhere to the Standing Orders before us and ensure that decorum is maintained.  I have 
<br/>been called names, but  as a young Member I  am  still learning.  I hope that  I am  forgiven by the 
<br/>honourable Members on the Government side and wish to learn more from the learned politicians 
<br/>and  leaders  who  are  present  in  this  Parliament.  At  the  same  time,  I  look  forward  to  the  training 
<br/>session that is organised for all Member of Parliament and hope to learn and engage more during that 
<br/>session.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the speakers who have spoken before 
<br/>me.  I thank the honourable Ketan Lal for his apology and the withdrawal of the comments from the 
<br/>record.  On that note, I have been instructed not to take this matter any further and that it will end 
<br/>here.  There are no more contributions from our side on the matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, what was said by honourable Ketan yesterday if you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>could all agree to be expunged from the Minutes of the meeting that is now before us to confirm.
