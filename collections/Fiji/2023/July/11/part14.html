<div><span>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the â€“  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immigration  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  17/2023),  be  considered  by  Parliament 
<br/>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 but that ample 
<br/>time be given to debate the Bill after the vote on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/>and Consequential Bills with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this 
<br/>motion.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I only speak as to why the Parliament must consider 
<br/>the Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 without delay.  It is hoped that the Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament will also limit their contribution fairly to the motion and substantive contribution to the 
<br/>merits of the Bill itself be made during the debate on Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Immigration Act 2003 amongst other things provides for the regulation 
<br/>of individuals entering or transiting through Fiji and the purpose of such travel.  Under the Act, a 
<br/>person who is a non-Fiji citizen cannot enter Fiji unless he or she is a holder of a visa or permit or is 
<br/>exempted under Section 8 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Section 8 of the Act lists the categories of persons who are entitled to enter, reside 
<br/>and work in Fiji without having to obtain a permit under the Act.  The Bill, therefore, seeks to amend 
<br/>Section 8 of the Act to now allow a person who is a non-Fiji citizen and whose name is registered in 
<br/>the </span><span>Vola ni Kawa Bula </span><span>(VKB), hence the registrations for all </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people, to be entitled to enter, 
<br/>reside and work in Fiji without obtaining a visa or permit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Act was first passed by the House of Representative and Senate 
<br/>in 2003, there was a provision that allowed for non-Fiji citizens but registered in the VKB to enter, 
<br/>reside and work in Fiji without having to apply for a permit.  However, in 2007, this provision was 
<br/>repealed by the Immigration (Amendment) Promulgation 2007 and in doing so, was removed at a 
<br/>time when there was no Parliament and Opposition to question such removal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, the use of Standing Order 51 has been criticised as Bills were introduced without 
<br/>proper  consultations.    However,  as  said  earlier  and  I  say  it  again,  from  this  Government,  public 
<br/>consultations were held on the Bill and based on the outcome of these consultations, this Bill is now 
<br/>being introduced in Parliament.  There were consultations or representatives from the Office of the 
<br/></span><span>Prime  Minister,  Ministry  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics, 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  for  iTaukei,  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts,  Fiji  Revenue  and 
<br/>Customs  Service,  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board  and  the  the  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination 
<br/>Commission.  There have been comprehensive consultations including visits to islands and villages 
<br/>in Lomaiviti, Beqa and Vanua Levu including the consultations that were held in Suva, Nadi and 
<br/>other urban centres.

<div><span>Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1185 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  again  I  would  like  to  raise  the  notion  of 
<br/>objecting to the fact that this issue is once again being brought through Standing Order 51.  Over the 
<br/>past eight years, if the honourable Turaga will look to his immediate right, immediately behind him, 
<br/>immediately to his left on this side; these were all the people that used to oppose this issue.  The 
<br/>honourable  Turaga  seems  to  be  under  the  misguided  notion  that  just  because  Government  has 
<br/>undertaken consultation, that that is all the consultations that is needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I need to remind the Government, sitting on this side is the FijiFirst Party which represents 
<br/>almost 50 percent of all the voters in this country.  Just because Government has undertaken all those 
<br/>consultations  does  not  mean  that  it  has  done  all  the  necessary  consultations.    I  do  not  see  why 
<br/>something that has been in play like this needs to be all of a sudden just taken to Standing Order 51 
<br/>and dealt with quickly.  What is wrong with us undertaking the full requirements of consultation in 
<br/>Parliament through a Committee that calls upon other people that it can question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  here  on  this  side  of  the  House  did  not  hear  all  the  comments  that  were  made  in  the 
<br/>consultations that the Government undertook.  If it is brought to Parliament, goes through the normal 
<br/>processes, we will have that opportunity for ourselves as Members of Parliament or Members of the 
<br/>Committee  to  listen  to  what  the  comments  that  are  made  by  the  people  and  finally,  once  we  go 
<br/>through that full consultation, then we can proceed with deciding whether or not to pass this particular 
<br/>Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I object once more.  We do not agree with this idea that this has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be fast tracked through Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just some clarification, you mentioned Head 50 or Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My apologies,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  just  reiterating  what  my  friend  to  the  right, 
<br/>honourable Usamate has actually just mentioned.  Yes, we have grave objections to this being brought 
<br/>in under Standing Order 51 and the question that is begged here to be asked is, what is so offensive 
<br/>with respect to this particular Bill that would stop it from being vetted and thoroughly done through 
<br/>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are talking about a sovereign country that at the end of the day, this is 
<br/>something that needs to be carefully vented with the Committee and a lot of the Committees have 
<br/>shown a lot of independence when actually making the decisions in the recent times.  I think the 
<br/>amendments that are being made probably require a little bit more airing and vetting with respect to 
<br/>what is in it, instead of just saying that we have done a couple of consultations around the country. 
<br/>It really does require the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My point is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why is it that the honourable Attorney-General finds it offensive 
<br/>to send it before a Committee?  What is the urgency? It is not a Bill that is required with respect to 
<br/></span><span>the Budget? What is the actual urgency? I do not think he has actually spelt it out, there are things 
<br/></span><span>we will debate obviously at a later time, but I really do not see the need for this to go under Standing 
<br/>Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think honourable Usamate has actually mentioned all the other things that there are quite a 
<br/>number of people on the other side who had grave objections to a lot of things that we did when we 
<br/>were in government with respect to Standing Order 51.  But in this one, it is quite plain, it is quite 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>simple.  Where is the urgency?  What is the urgency?  Have we got 20,000 people waiting to actually 
<br/>come into the country and this will provide for them?  Are they losing a right?  Is there something 
<br/>being lost and we need to do this on that particular urgent basis, I do not see it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I 
<br/>strongly oppose this particular motion that it is going under Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two components which I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respond: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the amendment of the Act will allow for a regulation to provide for the Fijian diaspora are 
<br/>also permitted to come to Fiji without permit. That has never been done before, that is related 
<br/>and that is why it is urgent to amend the Act before the Regulations are made; and 
<br/>for the first time, a Government who cares for its people and the Fijian diaspora overseas will 
<br/>provide them that right.  They should not complain because it came out of the window, no 
<br/>one was sitting, so it is going to go out the window also.  But on Friday, that is when we will  
<br/>hear the real issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes cast: 
<br/>- 
<br/>Ayes 
<br/>Noes 
<br/>- 
<br/>Not voted   -

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion is agreed to.
