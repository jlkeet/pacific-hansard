<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker, 
<br/>before I confirm the Minutes of the sitting yesterday, I wish to beg your indulgence and 
<br/>the indulgence of the House in the Budget response speech of the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Justice yesterday.  He inadvertently referred to your goodself, 
<br/>Sir, when he mentioned “Your Excellency the Speaker”.  He had meant  to say, “His 
<br/>Excellency  the  President”.    If  that  could  be  corrected,  Mr.  Speaker,  in  the  </span><span>Daily 
<br/>Hansard</span><span>, then we can proceed to confirm the Minutes. So, begging your indulgence and 
<br/>the indulgence of the House before we confirm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.  I think we all agree to that as he accidently said that. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Speaker, can I confirm the Minutes subject to the change?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I 
<br/>move:
