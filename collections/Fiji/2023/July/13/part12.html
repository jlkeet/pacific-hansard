<h3>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- $200,000?</h3>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- $200,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  What is the clarification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Why do you need the $200,000 for?  Are you doing any renovation or any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upgrade to your equipment and you need that amount of allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is an increase by $100,000.  Again, based on the submissions made 
<br/>by our staff in terms of the need to upgrade our IT and office equipment.  We have equipment that 
<br/>have been there for the last 10 years.  A lot of them are obsolete and are actually sitting on shelves 
<br/>and need to be replaced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is the really need to upgrade our system.  We are moving towards digitisation and so we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are going to need more equipment.  This is reflected in this amount that is increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister,  on  Programme  1-1(7)  -  Community  Based 
<br/>Corrections Programme ($70,000), could you just shed some light on this particular programme  - 
<br/>what is it for, where is it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, the community based corrections is the 
<br/>system  that  fosters  community-based  sentencing  options  and  rehabilitation  and  reintegration  of 
<br/>offenders.  Under the Act, it requires the supervision of offenders when they are sentenced through 
<br/>community-based work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocation under this particular SEG includes many activities which is implementation of 
<br/></span><span>the re-integration programmes and also the implementation of offender management programmes, 
<br/>engagement of judiciary and also engagement of community-based organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also would like to improve on the development of our volunteers because we have quite 
<br/>a  few  volunteers  involved  from  the  community,  and  the  remuneration  of  volunteers.    There  is 
<br/>allowance that is given to them on days that they are engaged, say about twice a week.  It is about 
<br/>$80 allowance per day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though the allocation is there, generally, I think this is the programme that may very 
<br/></span><span>well need to return to the Correctional Services because we are dealing with adults.  We have the 
<br/>juveniles who are dealt with in the Juvenile Centre and then we have got this for the adults which is 
<br/>under our Ministry.  So, this is something we will need to see if we can perhaps, move it to where it 
<br/>belongs and that is in the Correctional Services, but that is the discussion we are having. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I have a supplementary question on that.  We just need  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1467 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some clarification.  I understand what the honourable Minister said, but this would specifically be 
<br/>for women who have been convicted earlier or is it for everyone? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Women and men.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Women and men? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, we are dealing with adults with community-based corrections 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in our Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7)  - Development of Child Care Policy 
<br/>and Regulation, through you, I would like to request the honourable Minister to provide an update 
<br/>on the status of the Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The Child Care Policy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The update, I think it is perhaps, a question outside of this particular 
<br/>allocation.  The update on the policy is that, it is yet to come through Cabinet and there is Child Care 
<br/>Policy that is in process for child care to be provided at places of employment.  That is something 
<br/>that the guidelines that are being put out, so that employers can provide child care in their workplaces.  
<br/>It is yet to come to Cabinet for approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We wish to explore this option because of the need for mothers to be supported when they 
<br/>are at work.  It is a big undertaking by employers, they are willing to come on board to pay for it, so 
<br/>that they can have this part of the package for our women who are in the workforce.  We hope to 
<br/>encourage more women to be able to make use of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a good policy to have and I thank the Government, that is, your Government at that time 
<br/>who brought it forward, so we are continuing with it.  We thank International Finance Corporation 
<br/>(IFC) for their assistance in putting together this Child Care Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sir, my question to the Minister  on Programme 1-1(7) – Special Support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fund ($50,000), can she brief us on this  Allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, this is an allocation that has been from 
<br/></span><span>the previous year, there is no change to it.  However, this allocation is always there to assist any 
<br/>member of the public that needs urgent assistance that cannot be catered from any other programmes.  
<br/>So,  if  there  was  a  basic  need  item  or  immediate  welfare  needs,  this  usually  comes  through  the 
<br/>Minister or any of our Field Officers who are out in the field and there are urgent needs for our clients 
<br/>or their families, then we have that provision for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Lal, just to inform you that whilst Parliament is sitting, there 
<br/>is no movement amongst e honourable Members within.  We have the Orderlies here, they bring and 
<br/></span><span>take back what you want them to do, instead of us moving around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- That is noted, Sir, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may go on to your motion now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I move:

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 24-1-1(10) -  Assistance to Fire Victims ($100,000) to be increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sir, it is a similar explanation that I gave for the previous motion that I had 
<br/>moved for increasing house fire victims allocation to the previous Head, so same explanation for this 
<br/>one as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Chaiirman, this is more in regards to clarifications.  In fact, I can see 
<br/>under this SEG – 10, the motion raised by honourable Ketan Lal had an allocation of $100,000 for 
<br/>fire victims. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I can see in that previous Head (Housing Authority), there is also allocation for same 
<br/>purpose for $150,000.  So, if we could merge the two – this is just a clarification from the Minister.  
<br/>Maybe they have some better ideas, but people can double dip Sir, they can apply here and there as 
<br/>well, so just clarification on that Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  I  am  a  bit  lost,  honourable  Lal.    Are  you  making  suggestions  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- No, I am asking Sir, we have for the same purpose, allocations on different 
<br/>Heads.  Sir, we have got allocation here and then in the previous Head, there was also an allocation 
<br/>of $150,000.  Why different Heads for the same purpose, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Can we just address what is there for the Ministry of Women because 
<br/>we missed that chance to ask the question with the Minister for Housing.  Honourable Minister for 
<br/>Women? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, honourable Member, the clarification is 
<br/>that this assistance is only for our social welfare recipients, only for those in the system that lose a 
<br/>house in fire. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  seek  clarification  on  Programme  1-1(8)  – 
<br/>Refurbishment of Ba Mission Hospital ($710,801), my question to the honourable Minister which 
<br/>hospital is this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, it is part of the Ba Mission Hospital where we are looking at 
<br/>relocating the residents from the Lautoka Golden Age Home because it is unfit for them to stay there. 
<br/>So,  we  are  in  discussion  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  who  have  kindly  let  us  use  the  Ba  Mission 
<br/></span><span>Hospital to relocate them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, the policy from your Government was to relocate them to Labasa and it was just 
<br/>too impractical for the residents as well as the staff to move to Labasa.  So, we thought somewhere 
<br/>closer would be more better for everyone. So, the Ba Mission Hospital Wing that is available, we are 
<br/>looking at refurbishing so that they can be moved there.    HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 1-1(5) - Social Protection Programme Reform ($210,000). Honourable Minister, if you 
<br/>can kindly inform us what kind of reform is begin undertaken and in which programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, this Reform which is being undertaken 
<br/>with the World Bank, we have currently a National Coordinator that is in place, funded by the World 
<br/>Bank, that is going through this Social Protection Programme Reform. We also have provided this 
<br/>allocation  for  salary  expenses  of  three  officers,  who  will  be  engaged  in  the  development  of  the 
<br/>software system.  So the reform is towards the end of the first phase, now we are moving to the next 
<br/>phase where there will develop the software system for the Social Protection Programmes with the 
<br/>assistance from the National Coordinator and the World Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) - Implementation of Rights of Persons 
<br/>with Disability Act 2018 ($30,000), can the honourable Minister provide some information on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  an  increase  by  $20,000.    Again,  the 
<br/>implementation of this Act, we are committed to ensuring that the law is implemented.  It will take 
<br/>some information sessions to inform our organisations and all stakeholders that come under this Act. 
<br/>We are the implementation Ministry, so it is our role to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(8)  –  Refurbishment  of  Ba  Mission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hospital ($710,801), is that going to become an Old Peoples Home? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Just a temporary location. We have allocation for construction of a 
<br/>new Home in that same location because the current one is just infested by termites and they need to 
<br/>move.  So, we are just relocating them to this space temporarily while we construct the new Home at 
<br/>the same location. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was just worried that you are going to use that very old building to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>house them, but it is just going to be temporary.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  based  on  the  same  matter  raised  by  honourable 
<br/>Usamate, I understand that you are going to refurbish Ba Mission Hospital to relocate them.  But in 
<br/></span><span>SEG 10 - Construction of Lautoka Aged Care facility at the moment, $250,000 has been allocated. 
<br/></span><span>To construct, you will need more money but only $250,000 has been allocated. How are you going 
<br/>to use that money, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, this is a capital project that will see to 
<br/>the preliminary work to be carried out for this Lautoka Aged Care facility.  It is a new expenditure 
<br/>so it is intended to offer an appropriate structural proposal, aligned for an old age friendly design to 
<br/>be incorporated in the project  plan for the construction of this facility and to better facilitate our 
<br/>older  persons  residing  in  the  current  Home.    The  scoping  works  that  needs  to  be  done,  as  you 
<br/></span><span>understand this is the initial phase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-    Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-2(7)  -  Integrated  National  Poverty 
<br/>Eradication Programme ($200,000), could  the honourable Minister provide some clarification and 
<br/>if this amount is sufficient enough? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA- There is no change from the allocation from last year. This particular 
<br/>programme it caters for the need for a national poverty symposium. This is something that needs to 
<br/>be done.  As I had mentioned earlier in my speeches, poverty is a crosscutting issue, not just for our 
<br/>Ministry, so we need to have the symposium and </span><span>Talanoa</span><span>.  The Unit then monitors and evaluates the 
<br/>impact of poverty alleviation programmes across the board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the previous years, their role is really to strengthen coordination between Ministers and 
<br/>ministries.  So that is the information that they gather so they do go out and monitor programmes of 
<br/>Ministries, not just ours, to see if they are meeting the targets in terms of poverty alleviation. So, that 
<br/>is their role.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, honourable Minister, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  again  on  the  same  SEG  7,  I  note  that  now,  the 
<br/>Strategic  Planning  Unit  has  been  established.    Any  consideration  for  moving  this  Unit  back  to 
<br/>Strategic Planning? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD,-  Thank  you,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  you  are 
<br/>right. As the honourable Minister herself mentioned that there will be a very close coordination and 
<br/>part  of  the  reason  why  we  are  establishing  this  very  strong  National  Planning  Office  Monitoring 
<br/>Evaluation Unit is essentially to coordinate activities throughout the different Ministries and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation  Coordination  Unit  is  very,  very  important  because  we  found  that  there  is  a  lot  of 
<br/>disconnect and mismatch in terms of where the benefits go and who are the people.  A lot of people 
<br/>actually miss out simply because activities are not coordinated.  So, it will strengthen monitoring and 
<br/>evaluation and specific targeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because we are putting in a lot of money this time within the Ministry of Social Welfare, 
<br/>increasing the allocations right across, we need to ensure that this is monitored and the right people 
<br/>at an appropriate time actually get the benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Programme 2-2(6) – Social Pension Scheme ($78,156,000) allocation be doubled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  provision  of  social  pension  has  been    really  a 
<br/></span><span>transformative  way  of  trying  to    help  our  senior  citizens  in  our  country  over  the  past  few  years.  
<br/>Unfortunately, the impact  of being  able to  assist  these persons has been severely  depleted  by the 
<br/>effect of the 6 percent VAT and all of these other changes that are taking place with inflation and 
<br/>what not.  We believe, because of the importance of our senior citizens, we must be able to provide 
<br/>for them better.  Thus, the reason for this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Head  24-2-2(6)  -  Food  Allowance  for  Rural  Pregnant  Mothers  ($800,000)  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased by $200,000.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1471 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman,  the proposed increase to this allocation by $200,000 is 
<br/>to adjust the VAT increase and increase in other taxes, since there is an increase in the rate of VAT 
<br/>from 9 percent to 15 percent.  This substantial increase in VAT will impact the cost of living for all 
<br/>Fijians, including the rural pregnant mothers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is increase in the allocations for Social Pension Scheme, Family Assistance Scheme 
<br/>and Child Protection Allowance without any consideration for rural pregnant mothers.  There should 
<br/>be no disparity, hence I suggest an increase in this allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, I seek clarification from the honourable Minister 
<br/>regarding  Programme  2-3(5)  –  Procurement  of  Special  Care  Equipment  ($5,000).    Can  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  shed  some  light  on  the  type  of  equipment  and  purpose  of  this  to  the  senior 
<br/>citizens, please?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, again, there is no change from the previous allocation 
<br/>from the previous year but this allocation does cater for the purchase of special care gadgets, such as 
<br/>wheelchairs, walking canes, walkers, hearing aids, glasses, showers, cardiac beds, hoists, commodes 
<br/>and bath chairs for the residents at the three Homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, what we found through the Ministry is that we have a lot of Good Samaritans 
<br/>who  donate  these  to  the  Ministry  and  it  goes  straight  to  the  Homes  and  we  thank  them  for  their 
<br/>assistance.  They are always willing to come forward to donate these, so the amount that is there is 
<br/>really for when there are not any more Good Samaritans, but we do not run out of those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to Programme 3-1(7) - Women’s 
<br/>Expo  ($600,000)  and  Women  Economic  Empowerment  Programme  ($100,000).    For  Women 
<br/>Economic Empowerment Programme, how are you working with the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
<br/>to promote more women into businesses, because we can see $100,000 is actually not enough? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, the work we do with the Ministry of Trade is actually 
<br/></span><span>quite well coordinated.  In all of our Expos that we conduct, there is a Trade Officer who is present.  
<br/></span><span>That  Officer  works  with  our  women  on  the  ground  at  the  Expos  to  collaborate,  especially  the 
<br/>women’s organisations.  We have quite a few registered under the Ministry, so with the assistance 
<br/>with the Ministry of Trade and their Officers who are very active, they come forward and assist us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is coordination between our Ministry and the Ministry for Trade in terms of MSME 
<br/>grants that are available for women who do want to take the next step or want to grow their business, 
<br/>then there is the availability.  So, we have had some women who travelled with us to the Divisional 
<br/>Expos from the Ministry of Trade to assist in that regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just a clarification, Mr. Chairman,  Honourable Minister, I think the 
<br/>fact  that  you  are  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  and  connecting  women  to  the 
<br/>markets,  is  a  brilliant  way  of  empowering  women  as  well,  but  I  understand  Women  Economic 
<br/>Empowerment Programme, if you can elaborate what are some of these programmes that you have 
<br/>in place?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  allocation  caters  for  grants  to  assist  women 
<br/>entrepreneurs who are currently operating income-generating activities from home and in informal 
<br/>sectors.    We  look  at  single  mums  and  to  empower  them,  we  have  a  number  of  targeted  women 
<br/>entrepreneurs who want to start up their business.  The grant ranges from about $1,000 to $3,000 to 
<br/>assist women to become those entrepreneurs.  In this next budget, we hope to assist close to 100 
<br/>women with the funding that is provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, just the purpose of clarification and this is to do 
<br/>with SEG 6 - NGO Grants of $200,000 and Women Institution of $500,000. Can you just shed some 
<br/>light on which NGOs are eligible for this grant and which women institutions are eligible for this 
<br/>grant, or is it a process that they have to actually apply to get this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Honourable Member, this is specifically for NGOs to assist the work 
<br/>of the Department of Women in carrying out their core functions.  Organisations need to apply for 
<br/>these grants.  As always, it needs to go through the process and then we hope that this grant will help 
<br/>up to 10 women-led organisations for up to $10,000 each to support their work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  to  the  honourable  Members,  this  is  an 
<br/>addition to women institutions.  There are a lot of women’s groups which may not necessarily be 
<br/>registered  but  they  are  working  in  different  areas,  and  we  have  allocated  this  small  amount,  a 
<br/>maximum of $10,000, but they still have to apply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will have to develop a criteria.  For example, religious organisation women’s 
<br/>groups, they do not get any kind of support but they do a lot of economic empowerment and capacity 
<br/>building work.  So, this will be for that purpose and it will be monitored. We will see how it goes 
<br/>within a year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That was the reason for the question.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>her previous response. I think it is really important to help the women-led organisations and I just 
<br/>want  to  add  on  to  that  -  to  coordinate  with  other  Ministries  because  what  I  have  seen  is  that 
<br/>opportunities are there but maybe they do not open the page of the Ministry of Women or Ministry 
<br/>of so and So. I think that coordination between Ministries is very important.  I just want a clarification 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister on SEG 6 – Women’s Plan of Action ($500,000).  Could you, please, provide 
<br/></span><span>some clarification on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-As you would have heard me present  the National  Action Plan on 
<br/>Violence Against Women and Girls which was launched  earlier this year, there is  a commitment 
<br/>from Government towards this Plan of Action which is to 2027.  We have commitment from the four 
<br/>pilot Ministries so far.  You would have heard the question go to the previous Minister about that 
<br/>line item.  This is the Ministry of Health, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Education and 
<br/>Ministry of Youth. So, they have also committed a budget line.  It is the first time ever we have had 
<br/></span><span>Gender Responsive Budgeting so that is something new that we are committed to.  It was allocated 
<br/></span><span>$300,000 last year so we have increased it to $500,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  also  a  commitment  to  match  what  our  donor  partners  already  assisted  us  with, 
<br/>including the Australian Government. So, this is definitely a commitment that we have to try to deal 
<br/>with this national crisis.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1473 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 24-3-1(7) - Women Economic Empowerment Programme be increased by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>another $200,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- Apparently, we have a lot of our very vulnerable women entrepreneurs in 
<br/>our  informal  settlements,  our  </span><span>naus</span><span>,  aunties  who  are  selling  products  from  their  nearby  villages, 
<br/>especially  my  Cakaudrove  region  and  whenever  I  go  to  Nadi  or  Tailevu,  just  selling  all  these 
<br/>products.  Since there is a VAT increase, I would like to see some, sort of, assistance provided to 
<br/>these </span><span>naus</span><span> of mine when I visit them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now put this to vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Sir,  just  a  point  of  clarification,  was  there  any  guideline,  the 
<br/>suggestions or motions for increasing the allocations whereby they should identify where it should 
<br/>be allocated from, or just explain the source. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have discussed this in the Business Committee and we agreed that 
<br/>we no longer will be taking that stance that was dished out to us by the previous Government where 
<br/>you  have  to  explain  where  you  get  the  money  from.    We  ended  up  talking  a  bit  out  of  order  in 
<br/>Parliament because honourable Nawaikula referred to the honourable Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>of Economy and said, “this is not your  money, this is  not your father’s money” and it ended up with 
<br/>the Speaker as well where she said, “I got no money”.  Then honourable Nawaikula went further 
<br/>ahead and said, “I will get the money”, and this was during the late Jiko Luveni’s time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Speaker then, the late Jiko Luveni, raised that question because that was the process they 
<br/>had.  She asked, “Where will you get the money from?  He said, “I will get it from sacking that one 
<br/>(referring to the Minister of Economy) and sacking the Prime Minister”, and the savings from there 
<br/>will meet the cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I hope, I have answered your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Parliament  will  now  vote  on  Head  24  -  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 24 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 25 - Ministry of Youth and Sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,    Programme  1-1(10)  –  Upgrade  of  Youth  Training 
<br/>Centres ($279,953).  I believe that this would be for upgrade of existing youth training centres.  I 
<br/>would like to take up the issue of the youth training centre in Yavitu, Naceva, Kadavu, for which  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is currently paying a lease but it is not being utilized.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would recommend and perhaps, the honourable Minister might look into how this facility 
<br/>that has been there for many years and provide a lot of training for the youth  of Kadavu and the 
<br/>people from Vitilevu can be fixed and be reused again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- So, he is just offering his suggestion there.  There is no need for reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No, I thought he might have some plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I did not get that in the question that you raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the fund that is allocated is actually for for upgrade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the facility in Yavitu, Kadavu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  honourable  Usamate  has  already  asked  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, along the same line from honourable Usamate, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope the Savusavu Centre is also included in this one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, we have four youth training centres around Fiji, that is,  Naleba, 
<br/>Naqere in Savusavu, Yavitu and Nasau.  We will be looking at those that need to be restored, that is 
<br/>including Naqere in Savusavu as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister, could we just hold back for a while.  He has not 
<br/>finished his line of question.   Honourable Tuinaceva, have you finished your question before the 
<br/>Minister replied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- He has already explained, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  Programme  1-2(5)  –  Rations  for  Course 
<br/>Participants ($124,000).  I see there is a huge increase in this allocation compared to previous year, 
<br/>what is the reason for that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, the request for additional funds is to bring the average 
<br/></span><span>meal cost to, at least, $1 per meal. At the moment, we are paying less than that for each students, that 
<br/></span><span>is why the increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question.  It may have change now but 
<br/>the  normal  practise  is  because  we  are  enrolling  these  participants  free  of  charge.    So,  one  of  the 
<br/>requirement is that they should do their own gardening, plant cassava and all those things, so has that 
<br/>stopped now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- It is still there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Chairman, I have a motion.  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 25-2-1(5) – Sports Equipment ($20,000) be increased by $80,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1475 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Chairman, to cater for the increase in sports interest amongst 
<br/>our youth and the increase in the registration of new youth clubs and sports clubs in the new financial 
<br/>year, the request for sports equipment by these youth will also increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand Fiji National Sports Commission gives out sports equipment as well, but it is not 
<br/>enough.  Considering the new proposed VAT rate, $20,000 might be just the price of two full sets of 
<br/>gym equipment and other sports accessories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, it is very important to provide access to sports equipment to young people 
<br/>across Fiji.  This will help them in their training and also boost the development of sports in these 
<br/>divisions.  Therefore, I move that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocation for the Sports Equipment under Head 25, Programme 2, Activity 1, SEG – 5 
<br/>be increased by $80,000 which is $20,000 each for the Divisions – Eastern, Western, Northern and 
<br/>Southern Central Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Chairman, before I move second motion, I need clarification 
<br/>from  the  honourable  Minister  with  regards  to  the  allocation  of  $5  million  towards  the  overseas 
<br/>sporting  tours  on  Head  25-2-1(6),  whether  this  comes  under  Overseas  Sporting  Tours  –  the 
<br/>participation of  youth and the athletes in the Pacific Games? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  funding  allocated  will  support  the  following 
<br/>National  Sports  Organisations’  sports  events:  Athletics  ($56,970);  Bowls  ($76,251);  Rugby  ($1.7 
<br/>million); Cricket ($143,000); Deaf Sports ($95,000); Rugby League ($560,000); Chess ($50,000); 
<br/>Archery ($97,552); Tennis ($7,000); Surfing ($90,000); Badminton ($16,150); Outrigger Canoeing 
<br/>($43,430); AFL ($321,042); FABA ($62,345); Swimming ($68,000); Hockey ($240,000); Basketball 
<br/>($73,600);  Yachting ($263,235); Karate ($49, 720); Paralympics ($131,500); FASANOC ($1.3 v 
<br/>games  preparation);  Weightlifting  (241,550);  Gymnastics  ($251,410);  Baseball  ($30,000); 
<br/>Taekwondo  ($5,390); Judo ($45,000); Table tennis  ($75,000);  Drugfree  Sport Fiji  ($14,500);  Fiji 
<br/>Triathlon ($26,033); and Touch ($472,325). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do you still want to continue with your motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- I will withdraw that motion, but I have another motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Withdrawing this, then you have another one here.  This is to do with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the same SEG? Can you introduce your motion now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Head 25-2-1(6) -Fiji Sports Council ($670,000) be increased by $330,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.N.  TUICOLO.-  Fiji  Sports  Council  was  established  to  foster  and  promote  the 
<br/>development of sports and associate recreational activities in Fiji.  As we all understand that most of 
<br/>our unemployed youth access these facilities on a daily basis. Therefore, the operational cost would 
<br/>be high as well.  I understand they operate at a loss daily but providing service to the public and to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our youth.  Instead of just providing sports facilities, they are helping Fijians in combating NCD-
<br/>related disease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, I move that we increase that allocation by $330,000.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  The  Parliament  will  now  vote  on  Head  25  –  Ministry  of  Youth  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 25 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 26 – Higher Education Institutions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, I am just taking time to write a motion.  Is it alright if I can explain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or I write it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No , you just explain. We have done that before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I apologise, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I did caution  honourable Members on that yesterday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I note that, Sir. If I run out of time to write a motion, I will just explain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what I think needs to be done, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, the motion, if it were to be allowed would have been to increase 
<br/>the allocation for the Fiji National University by $1 million and to reduce the amount by the Pacific 
<br/></span><span>Polytech by $1 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, that is because the Fiji National University has a long record of doing 
<br/>technical training.  It has the facilities, it has the expertise.  Organisations like Pacific Polytech, while 
<br/>I am very familiar with its principles and have worked with them before, a lot of them I admire, we 
<br/>have worked together, but it does not have those facilities. It does not have the kind of people that 
<br/>would be able to deliver the work that we need.  So I believe that the best usage of this $1 million 
<br/>right now is with the National Training Productivity Centre which has its training facilities all around 
<br/>Fiji.  I think this is very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you are talking about the importance of TVET training, you need to go with an institute 
<br/>that  has  a  proven  capability  and  competence  to  do  it  and  that  is  the  NTPC  at  the  Fiji  National 
<br/>University.  So, if I had been given leave to write a motion that, Sir, would have been my motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to express my views. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- He is just expressing his views here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Yes,  but  I  want  to  respond  to  his  views,  Mr.  Chairman, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because he has made reference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National University (FNU) is an important institution. The funding allocation, and 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Education  can  add  to  this,  is  determined  by  the  Fiji  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission.    Institutions  are  recognised  and  registered  by  Government  through  the  Fiji  Higher 
<br/>Education Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of technical education right now is a serious one because the Technical Colleges 
<br/>that were set up was a major disaster.  We ended up wasting close to about more than $25 million as 
<br/>of  today.  Those  Technical  Colleges  were  set  up  by  the  previous  Government.    It  did  not  work, 
<br/>transferred to FNU, Mr. Chairman, ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is not the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, no, I am trying to explain to what he said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They need to hear it because he said something which needs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. J. Usamate interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It’s not a motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I am  trying to  respond to  your statement.  So, FNU was a 
<br/>disaster in  terms  of managing  those technical  colleges because they were not  supported with  any 
<br/>money. All the Colleges, Sir, were ruined, dilapidated shut down, thousands of students were left 
<br/>unattended, people lost their jobs and equipment deteriorated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This group, Pacific Polytech, was registered and recognised in 2021.  Under them, they tried 
<br/>to rescue and this Government has recognised that there are a number of players. If you go by his 
<br/>argument, he might tomorrow say, “close the university”, which they are trying to do at USP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the logic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So different institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot just rely on one institution.  We have a 
<br/>serious  shortage.    Employers  are  complaining,  everyone  wants  immediate  training,  competency-
<br/>based training and this is a Government which has handled that situation, this is not going to solve 
<br/>all the problems but the allocations to these institutions is not determined by the Ministry of Finance, 
<br/></span><span>nor determined by the Ministry of Education.  It  goes through proper vetting,  process  by the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Higher Education Commission and that is how the Higher Education Institutions have been allocated 
<br/>this funding, including all the universities and institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sangam Institute of Technology, we increased their budget by $500,000 because they 
<br/>are  giving  an  undertaking  that  they  will  take  in  more  nursing  students  because  we  have  a  great 
<br/>shortage.  So that is the situation with TVET and higher education training.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What you are saying honourable Usamate - coordination, integration, I agree, but right now, 
<br/>you cannot leave it to one institution, the more the merrier.  Once, we are able to reassess this and 
<br/>have a handle on the human resource development strategy, plans, gaps, then we can rationalise this. 
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, you can.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- There is no motion.  He was just expressing his views. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, but I want to respond to what honourable Professor Prasad has just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, no, just a matter of clarification, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Alright, unless your rise on the Point of Clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A clarification, Mr. Chairman.  Honourable Professor Prasad has just 
<br/>rubbished all the programmes that FijiFirst Government did, that is nothing new. But the institution 
<br/>that they are providing funding to - Pacific Polytech, the initial $1.26 million that was given which 
<br/>is not reflected in this Budget, from that money that institution went and paid six months rental where 
<br/>there was no enrolment. What sort of reputation are you talking about in this institution?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Qualification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Wastage of taxpayers money. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think he is making defamatory statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Move on, move on!

<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, before I move on my motion, can I ask a question to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Education? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Minister for Finance by saying that 
<br/>FNU is a very important institution.  Can the honourable Minister for Education advise us how many 
<br/>programmes  are  approved  by  this  new  Pacific  Polytech?    I  understand  they  were  registered  last 
<br/>December.  Are their lecturers qualified?  Has the Ministry done some assessment on them?

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  </span><span>Areh</span><span>, please, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  What am I lying about, I am asking a question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  assessment  was  done  by  the  Fiji  Higher 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education Commission.  They gave the registration on 30</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- There were eight programmes listed to be given by PPL under 
<br/>three Campuses – Nausori Campus, Tagitagi Campus and Labasa Campus.  That was the basis of 
<br/>their approval.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, may I ask a follow up question?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Honourable Minister, could you also advise as to what are those specific 
<br/>programmes  that  this  Polytech  will  be  doing  and  is  there  a  repetition  of  programmes  which  are 
<br/>already done by FNU, UniFiji,  USP or any other tertiary institutions that  are there?   Is  there any 
<br/>duplication, could you advise please?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- There is no duplication. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That  Head  26-1-1(6)  -  Fiji  National  University  ($41,456,429)  be  increased  by  another  $5 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, as highlighted by the honourable Minister of Finance that 
<br/>the institution is very important and since it has been our one of the successes of FijiFirst and many 
<br/>students have graduated from that University and are working.  They are workforce for the country, 
<br/></span><span>we need to provide more support for our national University. They are the pride of the Pacific and 
<br/></span><span>our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Mr. Chairman, our students and our University need the support with capital 
<br/>projects,  hostels  and  also  new  lecture  theatres  all  around  the  country,  especially  our  Western 
<br/>Division, Northern Division and the Central Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  same  time  we  need  to  get  more  lecturers,  we  need  to  increase  their  wages  and 
<br/>allowances who are working very hard for our students, at the same time, more and more support for 
<br/></span><span>our vulnerable students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand, this Government has removed the TELS debt and converted into work bond, 
<br/>but we need more sporting facilities for our students.  I understand the previous Government built a 
<br/>sporting gym at the Nasinu Campus.  We need a sporting gym and multipurpose court in Labasa and 
<br/>also in the Western Division, Lautoka especially.   That is the motion I have on the table.

<div><span>Question on amendment put.                                                                                                  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I would like to ask the honourable Minister if Pacific Polytech has been 
<br/>given the assets of the schools where teaching were discontinued?  If yes, what is the basis of doing 
<br/>this rather than following an open tender process?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, that process is still work in progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I think in some schools teaching has already begun. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It is still work in progress, the transfer of assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Are you sure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- He is the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- You are asking me the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Are you sure, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are you content with that reply? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- No, I am just asking if he is sure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The transferring of the assets is in progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, just a supplementary question to the previous question, 
<br/>and then I have one new question.  For Pacific Polytech, I would also like to know about the assets.  
<br/>The assets were bought by Government and the programmes are all advertised.  How did the Ministry 
<br/>decide to give $1 million when they did not have the assets?  Where are they going to conduct all 
<br/></span><span>these training? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, just to answer the honourable Member, they had 
<br/>been conducting their programmes since they were registered in 2022.  They were carrying out some 
<br/>of their programmes even without this.  Because of the need to produce more qualified trade skills 
<br/>and the programmes that they carry out and the current labour skill shortages, the programmes they 
<br/>offer are competency-based training as compared to FNU trade certificate training.  So these are short 
<br/>term programmes that will be needed to fill up the job market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Thank  you  honourable  Minister  for  your  explanation.  But  quality 
<br/></span><span>matters, therefore, any training programme without proper equipment, et cetera, can be disastrous.  I 
<br/>will leave it to that, but I will move on to the next question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My next question is on Head 26-1-1(6), we note that FNU’s budget is reduced by $2 million, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is there any reason for that?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1481 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The FNU budget of $41 million is to cater for the operational 
<br/>grant  payment  which  includes  operational  expenses  as  per  their  request.    There  is  another  FNU-
<br/>related grant – FNU Grant - Monash University ($2,000,000).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, even if you add Monash and operational grant it comes 
<br/>to $41.4 million as compared to $45 million given the previous year.  I just wanted to understand 
<br/>what could be the reason there is a reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  The  actual  utilisation  for  last  year’s  allocation  was  only  94 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent that is being utilized by FNU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-1(6) – Grant for Fulton College.  
<br/>Can  I  just  ask  the  honourable  Minister  whether  training  is  still  ongoing  at  Fulton  College?    A 
<br/>supplementary  question  to  that,  if  I  may,  a  lot  of  trainings  are  done  at  Nadave  especially  for  the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts, if Nadave is also considered under the Higher 
<br/>Education Institution Grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Fulton College $103,000 was allocated last 
<br/>year.  That was all fully utilized so we increased the allocation this year to $159,598 just to cater for 
<br/>Operational Grant for the institution.  For Nadave, it is not listed under Head 26, it is listed in the 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you  to  the  Minister,  the  funds  that  the  Fiji 
<br/>Government gives to various institutions, we always want to make sure that because it is taxpayer’s 
<br/>funds that it is used in the purpose that it is meant for.  And that when those funds are dispersed, they 
<br/>are used according to the dictates of good governance.  Given the issues that we have had with the 
<br/>University of the South Pacific in the way that the funds were used there and the reports that we raise, 
<br/>and the fact that these grants have been given back, are you adequately satisfied that the governance 
<br/>issues that we are very worried about, the way those funds were used in the University of the South 
<br/>Pacific have been used in the correct manner?  What you are doing here, you are giving $50 million 
<br/>to the University of the South Pacific with less money to our own Fiji National University? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the normal allocation is $30 million, the other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$20 million is for outstanding payment that is due. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Can I just add? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- What honourable Usamate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was asking the honourable Minister, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You do not want this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No, it is okay.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He does not want to hear what I was going to say, that is his 
<br/></span><span>trouble. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. TURAGA.- Tell him, tell him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is clear enough.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I just wanted to say one thing that in the 
<br/>Council, the Fiji Government in the next council is going to ask the University Council to release the 
<br/>independent video BDO Report on the  University.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have presented two motions to the floor.  The first 
<br/>one is an increase of $2 million to University of Fiji under Head 26-1-1, currently they are getting 
<br/>$2,804,774. I would like an increase of $2 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- University of Fiji is also one of our very important local universities and 
<br/>they have two campuses, one in the Western Division and one in the Central Division.  I think they 
<br/>have opened a new one as well, thanks to the previous government and also the University of Fiji 
<br/>administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is important that we need to support our students who are studying in 
<br/>the Western Division who are also vulnerable, at the same time the University needs to create more 
<br/>programmes for students  instead of giving to  new tertiary institutions like Polytech.  We need to 
<br/>support our local universities like University of Fiji and I think by increasing $2 million, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we can take away the million dollar from Polytech and give it to our local university.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be helping them by creating or giving them opportunities for more capital projects 
<br/>and providing the students with better classroom facilities, good lecturers can come in with a good 
<br/>pay from overseas especially the doctors who are studying in the Human College.  Mr. Chairman,  
<br/>that is the reason why I put a motion for a $2 million increase for University of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 26-1-1(6) to be increased by another 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$2 million with respect to the University of Fiji grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Ketan Lal your second motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I would like to move a motion to have a $100,000 increase 
<br/></span><span>for  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following tertiary institutions or higher education institutions under Head 26-1-1 and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fulton College 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>Corpus Christi Teachers College; 
<br/>2)</span><span>

<br/></span><span>6)</span><span> </span><span>Vivekananda Technical Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sangam Institute of Technology; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, thank you for the opportunity again, as I have been 
<br/>saying on and on these are our very local higher education institutions and it is important that we 
<br/>support them more and more.  For Corpus Christi, I met previously with a lot of students from Corpus 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Christi, Fulton College, Montfort Technical Institute and these student  leaders have expressed the 
<br/>need for more facilities for their students and by increasing these grants allocation to them, they will 
<br/>be able to create more and more students related or extra curriculum activities or facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that our Government continues to support these institutions, not only with the 
<br/>grants that are available here but by the increase of the $100,000 each.  At the same time some of 
<br/>these  colleges  are  also  providing  technical  vocational  education  rather  than  giving  Pacific 
<br/>Polytechnic Limited $1 million, we can give to these local higher education institutes and help them 
<br/>grow more rather than giving it to these new institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, at the same will be allowing our local students to engage more with our 
<br/>current higher high education instit.  That is why , Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have requested the motion to 
<br/>have $100,000 allocated to each of these named institutions - not USP and Pacific Polytechnic but 
<br/>the ones that I have mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I will now put this to vote on Head 26, to be increased by about $100,000 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each for five institutions and that is for Programme 1-1(6).

<div><span>Head 30 – Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(10) - Agriculture Marketing Authority.  
<br/>Last year they had a grant of $1.5 million and this year they have $3 million.  Can the honourable 
<br/>Minister  provide  some  update  with  regards  to  the  capital  works  that  is  required  with  this  money 
<br/>allocated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  to  let  the  Committee  know  that  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Assistant Minister will also be helping me in answering to the queries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To answer that question, you are fully aware that the facility under which AMA is housed 
<br/></span><span>right  now  in  Nausori  is  pretty  old,  but  they  own  the  facility.    These  funds  will  be  used  for  the 
<br/>renovation of their property to fulfil the export requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/>clarification.    Also  in  regard  to  Programme  1-1(6)  -  Navuso  Agriculture  Technical  Institute,  the 
<br/>allocation is of $1.1 million, an increase from last year’s allocation.  Can the honourable Minister 
<br/>also provide some clarification on this, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, Navuso Agriculture School is expanding every 
<br/></span><span>year which is good for the agriculture sector, because one of the worries right now is replacement 
<br/>farmers.    We  have  a  lot  of  our  young  people  who  are  leaving  our  shores  under  these  National 
<br/>Employment Scheme to Australia and New Zealand, but what we are trying to do is to train the young 
<br/>farmers through both Navuso Agriculture Technical Institute and Tutu Training Institute in Taveuni.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(6).    To  the  honourable  Minister, 
<br/>could he clarify on the International Fund for Agricultural Development, they have $100,000 and 
<br/>Food and Agriculture Organisation contribution have a $60,000 allocation.  Could the honourable 
<br/>Minister just clarify on what are the initiatives of these training programme and what do they have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- These are purely subscription fees for our membership of this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>UN organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman at the Programme 1-2(10), first we do appreciate 
<br/>the allocation given to assist commercial farmers to raise production to the next level.  We have an 
<br/>allocation  of  $500,000  on  Commercial  Farmers  Equity  Package  and  then  $2  million  under 
<br/>Commercial Agriculture Development Programme and I have also noted, maybe this is the question 
<br/>to  the  honourable  Minister.    Under  Head  50-7(10),  there  is  another  $200,000  allocation  on 
<br/>Commercial Agriculture Incentive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We would really love to know the demarcation in these allocations and perhaps my question 
<br/>as  well  is,  why  is  that  $200,000  allocation  listed  under  Head  50(10),  item  7  on  Commercial 
<br/>Agriculture Incentive cannot be just included to Programme 1-2(30).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Maybe  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  can  answer  your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is an additional allocation in Head 50 for farmers who 
<br/>may be outside of the normal scheme that the Ministry of Agriculture has, so that is an additional 
<br/>allocation, but it is under Head 50 and will based on what the Ministry of Agriculture comes up with 
<br/>as a new request.  There are always new areas that farmers want to explore, so that is the possibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- It is not a new thing, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No, it is not a new thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- During the previous budgets, even the Goat Programme used to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appear in Head 50 under your administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have a lot of questions but we will go ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We thank you for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2(7) - Public Consultation on Revision of 
<br/>Agriculture Laws.  Just a clarification from the honourable Minister, on what scope is that agriculture 
<br/>law is? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Ministry  for  Agriculture  has  some  very 
<br/>archaic laws. The oldest one is from 1900, so we are making attempts to review them.  There has 
<br/>been some suggestions to have just a generic law for all of agriculture, but some are also of the view 
<br/></span><span>that that is  impossible given the disciplines that  appear within the agriculture sector.  That  is  the 
<br/></span><span>review of those archaic laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  a  query.  Honourable  Minister,  earlier  on  you 
<br/>mentioned something about organic.  I seem to be searching high and low with respect to anything 
<br/>in there that is organic and the only thing I can find is with respect to organic fertiliser.   But if I could 
<br/>just give some background, Mr. Chairman, Fiji has a phenomenal potential with respect to organic. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1485 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is why we had developed Fijian Organic labelling.  There was work going on with respect to 
<br/>certification  that  needed  to  be  done  by  the  Ministry  so  that  we  could  use  that  labelling  and  our 
<br/>products could enter certain markets whether it was the USA or Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without  that  certification,  we  really  have  to  rely  on  PoetCom  and  other  people  who  will 
<br/>actually certify. It becomes a difficult exercise.  Organic for those that do not know our organic fruits 
<br/>and veggies are actually very high in demand. So how far have we gone with respect to it and I do 
<br/>not see any allocation there.  Is there a specific allocation or have you put it under somewhere else 
<br/>to get that certification or become the certifying authority for our Fijian Organic label to carry it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The organic labelling,  we are still working with  PoetCom on 
<br/>developing our own organic label. But what I had announced during the Budget is we are declaring 
<br/>research  station  as  an  organic  research  station  which  is  Naduruloulou  (on  the  banks  of  the  Rewa 
<br/>River).  We  want  to  say  how  serious  we  are  with  regards  to  our  approach  in  developing  organic 
<br/>agriculture products.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, supplementary question.  How far are we off getting that 
<br/>organic certification?  I understand we are already exporting turmeric and ginger but just getting the 
<br/>organic  certification  out  of  someone  else.  One  of  the  reasons  why  we  started  the  Fijian  Organic 
<br/>labelling was, it is a fantastic opportunity for all of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T. K. RAYALU.- Yes, I agree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Is it a long way off? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- No, it is not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Just  for  the  information  of  the  honourable  Member,  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chairman, there is $300,000 allocated under Crop Research for organic crop development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Sir, I think it has already been answered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  Programme  2-1(8)  -  Maintenance  of 
<br/>Existing Rural Offices and Staff Quarters has been given $1 million.  Can the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>provide some background information on the number of existing rural offices and staff quarters that 
<br/></span><span>he is going to attend to? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Thank you, honourable Member.  Mr. Chairman, I had made this 
<br/>known during my  maiden speech where I had mentioned that our officers live under substandard 
<br/>housing conditions.  The effort to improve the living quarters and the office is a continuous one.  We 
<br/>are  happy  that  we  have  been  given  this  $1  million  allocation  because  we  already  have  plans  to 
<br/>renovate  quarters  in  Koronivia  Research  Station,  Vunidawa  Agriculture  Station,  Lomaivuna 
<br/>Agriculture Station, Babavoce Agriculture Station and also the offices in Lakena and the maintenance 
<br/></span><span>of the Lakena Warehouse, fencing in Nayavu and the Naqesa Quarters. These will be the quarters 
<br/></span><span>and offices that we will be maintaining, some of them will be full renovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps it will be good for you to travel to some of the stations that we have already completed 
<br/>just to see the standard of quarters that we now have for our officers.  What we want is, when we 
<br/>send our officers to the rural stations, it is for them to feel at home there and not run away after their

<div><span>first day of posting.  When we were posted to Wainigata, the first two weeks, two ran away and I 
<br/>was left on my own in that station. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have a motion by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Would you care to introduce your motion?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-2(10), I did include this in my 
<br/>contribution  to the Budget debate on SEG 10  – Machinery Outsourcing. I know that it has been 
<br/>significantly decreased from the amount allocated last year.  The honourable Minister has clarified 
<br/>that it was because of the tender process that the allocation was not utilised and that is why it was 
<br/>part of the school assistance.  My motion, Mr. Chairman, is if you are not able to take it up to the $6 
<br/>million that was allocated last year, I am just suggesting an increase of $1 million to that allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sorry, I have touched much on it but just to say, Mr. Chairman, 
<br/>that  there  is  allocation  on  Farm  Mechanisation    and  Procurement  of  small  machines.    However, 
<br/>machinery outsourcing is a different allocation altogether because most farmers without machines 
<br/>who cannot access the farm mechanisation and procurement of small machines because of the one-
<br/>third and two-thirds contribution,  they usually submit  their request  with  the Ministry because the 
<br/>Ministry still provides the cheapest rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure whether that has been revised upwards but agriculture machines used to be $28 
<br/>an hour. This is why this outsourcing allocation was given so that if the agriculture machines are not 
<br/>available in the stations, they will subsidies the rate provided by the local farmers who have machines 
<br/>or  the  operators  so  that  they  can  have  access  to  this.    It  is  important  for  agriculture  particularly 
<br/>because of timings. We are approaching the ginger season now.  If they are in the queue and without 
<br/>the availability of machines from agriculture, then they will be in the queue for a long while. This is 
<br/>why I have asked for this $1 million increase in this allocation, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  I  now  will  put  this  to  the  vote  and  that  is  to  do  with  Head  30  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased by $1 million in Programme 2-2(10) with the respect to Machinery Outsourcing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-2(10)  -  Land  Clearing.    We  have  $0.5 
<br/>million  allocated.    I  know  there  is  a  lot  of  demand  for  land  clearing,  especially  from  our  rural 
<br/>communities  and  villages.    I  would  just  like  to  request  the  honourable  Minister  to  provide  some 
<br/>information and tell us if that $500,000 allocation is enough for that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, there has been no change from the last financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year’s allocation.  So, I think we are content with the amount. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-2(10)  -  Fertiliser  and  Weedicide 
<br/></span><span>Subsidy (</span><span>dalo</span><span>, ginger, rice, cassava);  $1 million is allocated to this.  I would like to convey to the 
<br/>honourable Minister that when you ask the health of a nation you are basically asking how healthy 
<br/>or fertile the soil of that nation is because the state of what we have is basically what we consume 
<br/>and the cultivation of crops.  We make it easy to use chemicals in our cultivation, we would seriously 
<br/>have future health issues and that burdens the health care sector.  Can the honourable Minister clarify 
<br/>that, if we are really to move towards organic because organic is sold very easily.  Growing is one

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1487 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aspect but you can grow in the way you store it with preservatives, again we add a lot of chemicals 
<br/>in our food and that is what we consume.  If the honourable Minister can clarify this allocation and 
<br/>if we are turning away or turning to organic?  Do you want to turn to organic or do you want to turn 
<br/>to an industrial-based and chemical-based farming sector and grow with these things? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the alternative to chemical fertiliser is organic 
<br/>fertiliser, and there are organic fertilisers around, which the Ministry is encouraging farmers to use.  
<br/>However, we have to look at the cost side of producing these commodities.  This project has come 
<br/>because of the cry of farmers on the high cost of inputs.  It is a welcomed gesture by the Government 
<br/>to offer them a subsidy which will in turn have some relief in terms of the cost and can contribute to 
<br/>an  increase  in  their  profits.    So,  I  guess  with  regards  to  the  issue  that  the  honourable  Member  is 
<br/>raising,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  working  on  the  organic  side  of  treatment  with  regards  to 
<br/>weedicides, fertiliser and other inputs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  need  some  help  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister to explain a bit on these farming programme allocations, just some ups and downs.  I have 
<br/>noted from the book that there is an increase in  the allocation given to  </span><span>dalo</span><span>, but with ginger and 
<br/></span><span>yaqona</span><span>, it is still like the same from last year, and there is a drop on rice.    Can I ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister to explain how he arrived at that decision?  Ginger is really going up, we are getting into 
<br/>the season now but still the same kind of allocation has been given and the same with </span><span>yaqona</span><span>? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister, honourable Tuinaceva is asking for your help. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, for </span><span>dalo</span><span> there is an increase of $250,000 and for 
<br/></span><span>yaqona</span><span> and ginger it is the same from last year, $400,000.  Some of these crops have become fully 
<br/>commercial and I think it is best left to the market forces to dictate how the commodities should be 
<br/>developed.  </span><span>Dalo</span><span> for example, has been commercial for some time, same as with </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and ginger.  
<br/>I think it is best left to the market forces to dictate what happens to the change in the commodity.  As 
<br/>for  the  funds  that  are  given  by  the  Government,  really  the  funds  are  to  complement  those  of  our 
<br/>farmers who are mainly subsistence level.  That would be the answer to the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, just a supplementary.  The farming programme 
<br/>for ginger, during the earlier debate when we asked the question about the ginger market, I know 
<br/>there were talks going on seeking the intervention of the honourable Prime Minister and some talks 
<br/>where you were going to get the market from China.  What is the progress on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- We have talked with the Australians.  They came to my office 
<br/></span><span>after I raised it in Parliament.  There are other forces at play when it comes to that level of politics.  
<br/>With China, getting fresh ginger across is quite tough, because of China’s strict market conditions 
<br/>and the tariff.  For us, you might notice, I have mentioned during my budget speech that I want to 
<br/>involve the private sector as much as possible.  So, we are going to pump funds into agro-processing 
<br/>because that will have a direct effect on production.  If one or two of the ginger processors in Fiji can 
<br/>take an extra 1,000 tonne, I think you will be laughing all your way to the bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, just a final one.  Honourable Minister, the same 
<br/></span><span>with </span><span>yaqona</span><span> market.  We discussed this because I was still touching on these farming programmes.  
<br/></span><span>What about the yaqona market, is it the same or are we getting markets too for yaqona? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The </span><span>yaqona</span><span> market is the same like I explained.  It has developed 
<br/>so much that the market forces are at play.  Right now, the low prices of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> offered to farmers 
<br/>is because those </span><span>yaqona</span><span> growing areas that suffered during </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> are now back.  Big producers 
<br/>like Koro, Taveuni, Coast of Cakaudrove, the honourable Leader of the Opposition in Saqani they

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are all producing now, even Kadavu have recovered. So, it is like there is an oversupply of </span><span>yaqona</span><span>
<br/>in the market which has resulted in the low price. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- One question coming from the farmers is about these middlemen 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are taking all the </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and selling them at higher price. What is that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Both come from </span><span>yasayasa</span><span>.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  answer  to  the  honourable  Member’s 
<br/>query on </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, I had announced that one of the things will do is to buy yaqona pounding machines 
<br/>because  that  will  allow  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>  farmers’  cooperatives  themselves  to  organise  their  own  markets 
<br/>which is, they will get a much better price than just selling the raw product. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-2(1)  on  the  Fertiliser  and 
<br/>Weedicide Subsidy (a new programme).  How will you roll out the programme because many will 
<br/>be listening in, will it be first come first served basis, what criteria when they would like to apply 
<br/>straight after the Budget is announced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- There are options available to us.  We could just prepare a tender 
<br/>and suppliers can tender, we will give them the conditions and the kind of chemicals that they need 
<br/>to supply.  That answers honourable Member’s query on the organic part. We can be strict on what 
<br/>they order and what they should not order and then we roll it out, it is outsourcing.  However, we 
<br/>could also just do it ourselves, but whether we have the storage, this is $1 million worth. So, it would 
<br/>be a better option to outsource it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, SEG 8 – Women in Agriculture Programme has 
<br/>been  allocated  $300,000.    To  the  honourable  Minister  and  few  other  Ministers  who  are  very 
<br/>passionate about the initiative in the Ministry, it is more of a suggestion and less or a question that 
<br/>we  need  to  invest  in  the  women  of  this  country.    The  best  way  to  do  it,  of  course,  is  through 
<br/>agricultural programmes and trainings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If this programme can coordinate with the Ministry for Women and Ministry of Trade because 
<br/>what I have learnt is, you can be a good farmer but you should be able to sell it and enter the market.  
<br/>So, if the honourable Minister can highlight more on the plans for the Women in Agriculture Training 
<br/>Programme and I highly suggest if it can coordinate with the Ministry for Women and Ministry for 
<br/>Trade so we can really create and cultivate locally led Fijians using Fijian resources and selling it 
<br/></span><span>globally and there is prosperity on that.  But what other plans, if you can highlight on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The two programmes  - floriculture, which is one of them are 
<br/>both implemented together with the Ministry for Women.  Even the Ministry for Regional is also 
<br/>involved in some way.  That has been the norm, just to answer your question but you are correct.  We 
<br/>would like more women involvement in the commercial part of things.  Floriculture is a good one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Chairman, if I can add on to what the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  Agriculture  had  just  mentioned.    The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  has  a  policy  for  women  in 
<br/></span><span>agriculture and as being mentioned, we coordinate work with other ministries and it involves a lot of 
<br/></span><span>activities for women in agriculture, we have a lot of respect for them.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Just to add a bit to that, the Assistant Minister for Women is very much 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right here and she is a great example of doing this.  That is all I want to add from the Chair.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I just have quick question on Programme 2-
<br/>3(7) -  Demonstration Farm and Regional Training Centre.  Is Indonesia going to fund this in Fiji?  
<br/>Where will it be? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, it will be in Dobuilevu because Dobuilevu is an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intermediate zone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Head 30-3-1, I must apologise I have two here regarding Activity 1.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>first one is from honourable Ketan Lal and the other one is honourable Viliame Naupoto.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  move  that  Head  30-3-1(7)  be  increased  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$50,000 with respect to Animal Welfare Programme - SPCA Partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I know that agriculture, the two men are sitting to my left, but I am 
<br/>focusing to that corner of the other side of the House if the honourable Minister for Infrastructure 
<br/>can move this way a little bit.  I know the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Lenora is sitting at the back.  This is the easiest motion that you can say 
<br/>no to because the beneficiary of this motion will never vote for you, never vote for anyone anyway. 
<br/>These are animals.  Therefore, I am not appealing to your mind, I know your mind is full of dollar 
<br/>signs now. I appeal a little bit lower to your heart in this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  talked  about  it  yesterday  during  my  response  to  the  Budget.    I  would  like  to  think  that 
<br/>perhaps we had set a record in this Parliament, talking about animal welfare in one of the biggest 
<br/>events for Parliament which is the Budget.  I thanked the Government yesterday for the provision of 
<br/>$130,000 that you have given to SPCA.  For those of you who have not been to SPCA, it is tucked 
<br/>away in Walu Bay in the industrial zone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The area that they are operating in is so small compared to the number, so they cannot hold 
<br/>animals as shelter for the strays that are brought in.  I know that the Ministry of Agriculture, if they 
<br/>trap dogs, they take them there, but they are so full that sometimes they will just neuter and then 
<br/>release them back.  That is a big way towards controlling the strays and making sure that our attitude 
<br/>towards these animals are not as cruel as they are.  They reproduce in a faster way, so it is always a 
<br/></span><span>catch up game. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am asking that it be increased to $50,000 and again I am looking at the corner there, the 
<br/>$10,000 from someone’s travel.  I know that there is a Stray Animal Control (I am not too sure) in a 
<br/>later programme under Livestock, but if we increased what they do for SPCA is that they help out in 
<br/>the urban areas where they look after our animals that we are so cruel to.  You see them walking 
<br/>around, no skin, injured, some with hot water burns, that extra $50,000 goes a long way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My only interest in SPCA is that me and my family, t the little things that we can do, we help 
<br/></span><span>and take it down; very miniscule compared to those   that also support that place.  I am appealing to 
<br/></span><span>you for this increase for SPCA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the minutes of our meeting from  yesterday, there are two in there that says 
<br/>“agreed to unanimously”.  We can do this for our animals.  It is only $50,000 but I assure you Mr. 
<br/>Chairman  that  this  goes  a  long  way  towards  shaping  the  character  of  our  society  to  be  kinder  to 
<br/>animals, at least we are not talking about killing them and selling them and money.  This is for us not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now put this to the vote that Head 30 to 
<br/>be increased by $50,000 in Programme 3-1(7) with respect to Animal Welfare Programme and the 
<br/>SPCA partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, question to the Minister of Agriculture.  In Programme 
<br/>3-2(8) we have a fund for Beef Extension Programme of $170,000.  In relation to this, is on the very 
<br/>next Programme 3-3(8), there is another $1 million for Beef Breeding Programme. I have been very 
<br/>excited to read the developments that are taking place in agriculture for the new brands, breeds of 
<br/>beef that they are bringing through the Wagyu, Senepol and one of these might be the beef to the 
<br/>Droughtmaster.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noticed that there is big money there in millions of dollars.    We have been talking about 
<br/>this for a long time, but the money for the extension is only $170,000.  Can the Minister just highlight 
<br/>how fast the passing on of these breeds into the market, so we can begin to see their impact?  Because 
<br/>I see far more money is there in the Breeding Programme rather than the Extension Programme.  If 
<br/>you can just highlight how well these breeds are going out into the market for the beef sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- I will let the honourable Assistant Minister handle that question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Chairman, let me elaborate on the two different programmes 
<br/>that we have.  Beef Extension Programme is done outside for beef farmers whereas the actual Beef 
<br/>Breeding Programme is concentrated at research stations where infrastructure is required.  We have 
<br/>some infrastructure for the Beef and Livestock  Improvement Programmes.  They are very highly 
<br/>scientific procedures that we will be following and it requires infrastructure that we do not have at 
<br/>the moment.  That is why we have a lot of funding in that area and we will be doing all breeding and 
<br/>research programmes on research stations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before we provide farmers with improved breeds, they go through breeding and it has to be 
<br/>tried in our local situation.  No matter how good the breed will be from outside countries, it has to 
<br/>go through other research to verify whether they can be distributed to farmers.  Another is how they 
<br/></span><span>respond to climate, different feed and different management practises that we have and those have to 
<br/></span><span>go through a number of years of research.  It has to be then crossed to local breeds because it takes 
<br/>time  for  the  breeding  cycles,  normally  it  takes  three  years  before  the  first  drop  calves  will  then 
<br/>reproduce and distributed to farmers.  It takes long for farmers to realise the new breeds that has been 
<br/>introduced. The fastest could be after 15 years but we can start to have some crosses well within 10 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last breeding programmes we have improved, genetics had been only in the last six years.  
<br/>We  have  had  some  that  had  crossed  with  our  local  breeds  and  had  been  evaluated  with  different 
<br/></span><span>management practises. Those are the ones that we can positively say that they can survive in our 
<br/></span><span>local conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the other programme, we assist farmers with infrastructural assistance in terms of farm 
<br/>sheds, fences on roadings, stock yards and other infrastructures in the farm.  Why research is given 
<br/>a lot of funding  is  because we will have to  be importing pure genetics  and we  will have to  have 
<br/>specialised personnel to do the technologies for us.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With embryo transfer, because it has just been done in Fiji for the last years, we are still trying 
<br/>to train our officers to do embryo transfer, but at the moment we are also constructing facilities that 
<br/>we can keep embryos that can be used on farms.  The actual set up will be expensive and it is going 
<br/>to take a number of years to complete the work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Supplementary  question.    Thank  you,  Assistant  Minister,  for  the 
<br/>explanation, so  I get  it from  there that the Beef  Extension Programme at  the moment  is  more on 
<br/>fencing those sorts of materials whereas the new breeds moving out into the farms will probably take 
<br/>a few more years.  Would that be correct? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Through you Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-2(9) on Stray Animals 
<br/>Control Campaign.  I would like to move a motion that the amount be increased from $430,000 to 
<br/>$1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, I seconded the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Chairman, through you, I know this is a real issue on the ground and 
<br/>the honourable Minister is also aware of this.  Daily farmers are running to the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>Office  or  Police  Stations  trying  to  report  on  the damages  done  on  their  farms  and  the  amount  of 
<br/>money that is put in by the Ministry of Agriculture and the hard work put in by the farmers is gone 
<br/>to waste from the damages done by stray animals.  We also see while travelling through King’s Road, 
<br/>Queen’s Road and all around Fiji what the motorists are also facing in regards to the issue of stray 
<br/>animals.  These stray animal issue is not only in Viti Levu but in Vanua Levu and all our farmers are 
<br/>going through the same.  So I urge that there should be an increase of $570,000 to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-  I now put  this  to  the vote. The motion  has to  do with  Head 30 to  be 
<br/>increased by $570,000 that will take it up to $1 million in Programme 3-2(9).  This is to do with stray 
<br/>animals and the campaign about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I have a question and a motion is on the way.  The question 
<br/></span><span>is to the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways on Programme 5-1(8) -   Drainage for 
<br/></span><span>Farmlands.  Can the honourable Minister explain further and elaborate on this particular SEG.
