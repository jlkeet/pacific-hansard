<div><span>Honourable Members, in one of our discussions at the Business Committee, the Government 
<br/>had agreed to provide an update to Parliament with respect to Fijiâ€™s ongoing commitment towards 
<br/>the Sustainable Development Goals and also the National Development Plans and I look forward to 
<br/>this at a later sitting of this year.
