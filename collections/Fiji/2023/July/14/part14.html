<h3>LIQUOR (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>LIQUOR (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, I move that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 16/2023), be debated, voted upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the  Liquor 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill 2023 which I will refer to as the Bill which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  consultations  in  relation  to  Bill  were  held  with  the  Ministry  of  Home 
<br/>Affairs, the Fiji Police Force, the Office of the Attorney-General in particular, the Speaker.  Public 
<br/>consultation  in  relation  to  the  opening  of  nightclub  hours  was  also  held  in  Suva,  Labasa,  Nadi, 
<br/>Lautoka,  Beqa,  Vanua  Levu,  the  Lomaiviti  Group,  namely,  Nairai  Gau  and  Batiki,  and  the 
<br/>communities  in  the  Central  Division.    Particularly,  the  members  of  the  Wasewase  o  Lomaiviti  – 
<br/>Lomaiviti Divisional and communities in the Central Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we heard from our new Member the need for consultation.  
<br/>Of course, we all know that most of the laws that are now enacted never went through the consultation 
<br/>process. We said from the very beginning that when we are in Government, we are going to listen 
<br/>and we are going to consult.  That is precisely what we did.  People in glasshouses should not throw 
<br/>stones.  </span><span>Leuta mada mai na malamala mai na matamu.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the Liquor Act 2006 provides for inter alia the regulation of liquor licensing 
<br/>and permitted hours for the sale of liquor and has generally had a direct link to the opening hours of 
<br/>various venues which sell liquor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in the 
<br/>Gazette.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Schedule to the Act to remove the special zones.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, special zones under the Act, as I have mentioned on Tuesday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, are areas in Nadi 
<br/>and  Suva,  where  liquor  can  be  sold  beyond  the  permitted  hours.    For  the  clarification  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, the permitted hours under the Act are as follows::  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Taverns, it is from 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 a.m. daily and from 7.00 a.m. to 3.00 a.m. in 
<br/>special zones; 
<br/>Permitted hours for the sale of liquor in restaurants is from 11.00 a.m.  to 12 midnight daily, 
<br/>and from 7.00 a.m. to 3.00 a.m. in special zones; and 
<br/></span><span> Permitted hours for the sale of liquor in nightclubs is from 5.00 p.m. to 1.00 a.m. daily, and 
<br/></span><span>from 5.00 p.m. to 5.00 a.m. in special zones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendments in the Bill intends to remove the special zones in the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hence, permitted hours for the sale of liquor will be as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For taverns, from 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 a.m.; 
<br/>For restaurants, it will be from 1.00 a.m. to 12 midnight daily; and 
<br/>For nightclubs, from 5.00 p.m. to 1.00 a.m. daily. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government, in its concern with the numerous reports of brawls, robberies and 
<br/>attacks  in  areas  around  nightclubs  and  in  special  zones  in  the  early  hours,  intents  to  reduce  the 
<br/>opening of nightclubs and other drinking venues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, Government in its effort to respond to the social issues related to the long opening 
<br/>hours of nightclubs, intent to reduce the opening hours for nightclubs and drinking venues.  In actual 
<br/>fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have now is more a consistent law.  Before, some nightclubs close at 
<br/>12.00 a.m. or 1.00 a.mm, some at 5.00 a.m., now nightclubs, taverns and restaurants will close at the 
<br/>same time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  highlight  an  article  published  in  </span><span>The</span><span> </span><span>Fiji  Times</span><span>  on  14</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>August, 2016, titled, ‘Dagger in a Bottle’.  This article highlighted the story of a person who suffered 
<br/>from an injury which left him paralysed from the neck down in 2006.  In his own words, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It was three days of big drinking and I had drunk myself to the oblivion.  I do 
<br/>not remember anything that happened afterwards.  My friends later told me that I was 
<br/>sitting on a stool which was placed on the table and I was trying to tie my shoe lace.  
<br/>The stool suddenly flicked and I fell badly on the concrete floor hitting my neck.  All 
<br/>I remember was waking up like this.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He further highlighted the use of alcohol and substance abuse, and if it is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>too late, I thank him for sharing his story with us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that alcohol and substance abuse is not an issue which came 
<br/>overnight.  We do not intend to interfere with the people’s right to consume what they want.  But our 
<br/>intention is to reduce the hours of alcohol that can be sold in venues intentionally decide to create an 
<br/>atmosphere which encourage patrons to consume alcohol for hours on end.  This leads to problematic 
<br/>behaviour  in  that  moment  itself  and  other  long  term  effects  on  their  health,  which  they  can  only 
<br/>realise when it is too late.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is no secret that the consumption of alcohol is known to have adverse effects on physical 
<br/>and mental health.  It can be enjoyed as long as you drink responsibly.  But that is the challenge - 
<br/>drinking  responsibly.    Unfortunately,  our  people  including  our  youth,  indulge  in  the  excessive 
<br/>consumption of alcohol.  This is a long standing issue which has led to various social issues arising 
<br/>in the society and those social issues are becoming more apparent by the day.  It is our responsibility 
<br/>as a Government to address these issues urgently before society is harmed further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the friendly nature of our people in Fiji is our pride.  It saddens me that a 
<br/>young man lost his life due to being assaulted offside a nightclub in Suva, as reported in the media 
<br/>in March this year.  Would a man who drank responsibly decide to assault an innocent man until he 
<br/>was motionless?  Unfortunately, this was not the first case and I dare say, it will not be the last if this 
<br/></span><span>issue is not addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have a very informative report here.  It is the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 
<br/>2018, by the World Health Organization (WHO).  I will highlight an important paragraph from the 
<br/>Report, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1555 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health 
<br/>worldwide and has a direct impact on the many health-related targets of the Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious 
<br/>diseases  (HIV,  viral  hepatitis,  tuberculosis),  noncommunicable  diseases  and  mental 
<br/>health, injuries and poisonings.  Alcohol production and consumption is highly relevant 
<br/>to many other goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alcohol per capita consumption per year in litres of pure alcohol is one of two 
<br/>indicators  of  SDG  health  Target  3.5  –  “Strengthen  the  prevention  and  treatment  of 
<br/>substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to dissect this paragraph in Fiji’s context.  I have witnessed many 
<br/>a times people regretting after a night out and swearing they will never consume alcohol again when 
<br/>they have a hangover.  Well, let me tell you, Sir, a hangover will be the least of their problems when 
<br/>they realise what other health issues excessive consumption of alcohol leads to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  recent  times  there  have  been  numerous  reports  in  the  media  in  relation  to  Non-
<br/>Communicable Diseases (NCDs).  On 14</span><span>th</span><span> February, this year, the FBC reported that according to 
<br/>the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, 80 percent of deaths in Fiji are caused by NCDs.  This 
<br/>is, of course, one of the reasons why we are increasing duty on unhealthy snacks and juice in this 
<br/>Budget, as highlighted by the honourable Minister of Finance, but not only unhealthy snacks and 
<br/>juice are causing NCDs.  People consume excessive alcohol and smoking tobacco are also part of the 
<br/>80 percent, as consumption of alcohol can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and high 
<br/>cholesterol.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does not end with NCD.  Another risk associated with alcohol misuse is 
<br/>the practice of unsafe sex, which can lead to infectious diseases, such as HIV and viral hepatitis.  It 
<br/>is critical for me to highlight this point as earlier this week, we heard from the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Health that Fiji recorded 46 HIV-related deaths last year, which was the highest ever for Fiji and 
<br/>in the region.  The WHO Report also highlighted, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  growing  evidence  of  a  contributing  role  of  harmful  use  of  alcohol  to  the 
<br/>disease  burden  of  infectious  diseases  such  as  HIV,  tuberculosis,  viral  hepatitis  and 
<br/>sexually transmitted infections has not yet been sufficiently recognized and addressed in 
<br/>the relevant global strategies and action plans.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is time we recognise and address what role alcohol is playing in the increase of HIV cases 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji, and this Bill will help us to do exactly that.  We do not want to collect tax at the expense of 
<br/>our people. We want to find solutions, thus we need to change things to see what impact it will have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Ministries cannot work in isolation.  We cannot have our laws allowing the sale of liquor 
<br/>until  hours  as  late  as  5.00  a.m.  while  our  health  workers  and  health  system  is  burdened  with  the 
<br/>increasing cases of NCDs and HIV.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While on the topic of tourism and point raised on how the reductions in permitted hours for 
<br/></span><span>the sale of liquor will affect our tourism sector, let me highlight the issue people are facing on the 
<br/></span><span>ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the consultation in Suva, it was brought to our attention by members of the public that 
<br/>in  Nadi,  the  first  few  things  tourists  arriving  into  the  country  through  Nadi  International  Airport 
<br/>witnessed are club patrons urinating in the public and the pub, people fighting and people passed out 
<br/>on the streets.  The first impression is not the positive one for our tourism sector.  It was also revealed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>1556 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during the consultation in Lautoka that intoxicated parents spend the night at the Lautoka Bus Stand 
<br/>and urinate where produce is sold the next day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask  our people, especially our youth, what is  attractive about untimely 
<br/>deaths  and  health  problems  that  we  tend  to  drink  such  excessive  amounts  of  alcohol?    What  is 
<br/>attractive about getting so drunk that we end up harming ourselves and others?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is for these reasons that we are proposing to permit the sale of liquor in drinking venues 
<br/>until 1.00 a.m.  We know this will not completely solve the issue but it will definitely help bring a 
<br/>change we desperately need it in our society.  It will help our people evaluate the relationship they 
<br/>have with alcohol and sort out their priorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know our people need to enjoy, relax and we want for them as well but getting drank to 
<br/>a point where you put yourself in danger and cannot make it home safely is not what our people 
<br/>should be aspiring for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no joy finding out that 80 percent of our deaths in our country are 
<br/>due to NCDs and that we are leading the region in terms of HIV-related deaths.  There is no joy in 
<br/>finding out that a young man has lost his life due to a brawl starting in a nightclub, a place where he 
<br/>should have been enjoying himself.  There is no joy in finding out that people are getting robbed and 
<br/>assaulted after coming out of nightclubs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Government’s priority and, that is, the Coalition Government, is our 
<br/>people.  People first and the reduction of hours for the sale of alcohol will help us address the social 
<br/>and health problems we are facing as a nation today.  Let me end with this, “health is wealth”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  I  offer  the  floor  for  the  debate  to  begin,  just  for  housekeeping 
<br/>purposes,  I humbly ask you, honourable Members if we could all try and make it orderly, as just of 
<br/>now you may have noticed we are doing sign language from here to the Whips.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have now received a list of speakers for this particular Bill and there are three from each 
<br/>side.   The first speaker will be the Opposition, honourable Faiyaz Koya is the one listed here and 
<br/>then honourable  Aliki Bia and honourable  Iowane Naivalurua. Alternately, the first  one from the 
<br/>Government  side  will  be  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications;  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts; and then it will be the honourable Minister for Home 
<br/></span><span>Affairs and Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a consensus on the length of time for each speaker which is five minutes and that has 
<br/>been agreed.  Whilst we take care of this particular Bill that is now before us, I, again, urge both 
<br/>Whips to, please, you do your conversing with your Members and tidy up for the next few Bills that 
<br/>is  going  to  be  coming  after  this  so  that,  at  least,  Members  and  those  in  the  gallery  will  quickly 
<br/>understand the duration of each speaker and how much time we are going to to devote on this.  That 
<br/>is all I ask for now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will ask honourable Koya, as usual, to begin the debate, after which will be Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister Kamikamica, so five minutes each.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  five  minutes  and  I  will  try  to  be  as  brief  as 
<br/>possible.  The Bill presented by the honourable Attorney-General, in effect, is just one thing and he 
<br/>is seeking to amend the Act to remove the special zones that exist in Nadi and in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1557 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we must realise is, these particular zones were created 
<br/>for a purpose, and these are tourism zones.  There was a considerable amount of money that was 
<br/>spent by a lot of operators in Nadi, and I am sure the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications is aware of this.  
<br/>A lot of the operators moves out of Nadi Town into that particular zone and they moved their entire 
<br/>nightclubs at some considerable expense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  just  go  back  a  short  period  of  time.  During  COVID-19,  please,  remember,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that all of these nightclubs were closed - zero income, absolutely nothing!  We were one of 
<br/>the first countries in the world, off the block, to open our tourism doors and that was the main basis 
<br/>of that particular zone being there in Suva and in Nadi, to accommodate the tourists, not just overseas 
<br/>tourists,  our  local  tourists  as  well.    People  going  somewhere,  young  people  wanting  to  enjoy 
<br/>themselves.  You cannot isolate these things and say, “A couple of incidents”, and we shut it down 
<br/>completely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are quite a few anomalies and I want to quote one nightclub owner, 
<br/>who actually messaged, and said, “if you close the nightclubs at 1.00 a.m., we will only be operating 
<br/>for four to five hours every night which is actually quite a loss for us.”  They have got 45 odd staff 
<br/>that they have to cater for.  Right now, they are opening from 9.00 p.m. and closing at 4.30 a.m. with 
<br/>those 45 staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Police, Mr. Speaker Sir, it is better for them  to monitor in a concentrated area, then 
<br/>all around the place, and I will explain why.  I am a resident of the West - born and bred.  At the 
<br/>moment, I have been living in Suva now for the last eight years, but I know what happens there, Sir.  
<br/>The minute you close it early, Mr. Speaker, Wailoaloa Beach is the first place they end up with the 
<br/>rest of the alcohol.  And guess what? You have suddenly opened up a black market for booze.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The black markets will start selling alcohol after they shut off the nightclubs.  So, is it not 
<br/>better served if you actually do it in a concentrated area where the honourable Minister for Home 
<br/>Affairs can keep his police people there to make sure that there is no nonsense.  Of course, there is 
<br/>going to be incidents, you cannot blame alcohol for everything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People have to be responsible, Sir.  This is the lifeline for many people in Nadi.  I know that 
<br/>there are hotel workers that turn up to the clubs after a whole day of hard work and they go to the 
<br/>nightclub because it is open until 5.00 a.m. and they enjoy themselves and they go back home, but 
<br/>they do not create problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a whole economy that runs and guess what, Mr. Speaker, one of the most important 
<br/>things that we have within our economy is our Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). You 
<br/>go outside the nightclubs here in Suva, you have got thriving businesses there that create enough 
<br/>income - $900 to $1,000 a night, which they earned from those people who drink. We all know what 
<br/>it is like - you get hungry after you have had a few drinks. They all eat there. They are all going to 
<br/>lose  business.  You  have  just  cut-off  that  particular  business  even  more  so  after  the  hike  and 
<br/>everything else that you put up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My point is, Mr. Speaker, and it does not actually correlate this.  Again, the reason why we 
<br/></span><span>had objected to this coming via Standing Order 51, it would have been great if we had it before a 
<br/>Committee - we could have consulted with everyone – the general public, and then come back with 
<br/>a report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the honourable Attorney-General a question, is there a nightclub 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Nairai? Is there a tavern in Nairai?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>1558 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is invalid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is a valid question. Why is it that the consultation went there?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From what I understand, the nightclub owners came to you and said, “No, this is not going to 
<br/>work.” They have just gone through COVID-19, Mr. Speaker. It is going to be absolutely devastating. 
<br/>This is an activity that every single person sitting here has been involved in - visiting nightclubs.  I 
<br/>am sure, Sir, I can guarantee everyone’s been there. No one is saying, “no”.  As a matter of fact, I 
<br/>know that the honourable Minister for Home Affairs with his thumbs up, I know where he used to 
<br/>go because I used to go to the same place. Is that correct, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P. Tikoduadua interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism had just been hit, and I do not want the numbers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to go down. Tourism is just been hit and we are actually giving it another hit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have a whole lot more to say but at the end the day, I do not think, honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General, that this a well thought-out exercise.  I can tell you this much - that the nightclub 
<br/>owners in Suva and in Nadi and with those particularly within those zones, are saying, “How much 
<br/>revenue are we going to lose, we do not know.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  worst  part  about  all  of  this  is,  I  know  in  Nadi,  suddenly  all  these  black 
<br/>markets, and I can see the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs nodding his head, he knows 
<br/>too what happens in Labasa. He is an expert in alcohol.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- He knows that, Sir, but it is not the alcohol, it is the people. We just need 
<br/>to ensure that we actually nurture it.  Now, we have got a great Police Force, he can send more people 
<br/>out there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is an expert in making alcohol or drinking? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- He will tell you about this. I am not going to make anything, but I know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he is an expert, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Alright, good. Are you rounding off, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am just rounding off, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the most important things that is actually quite hurtful to me as a former 
<br/>Minister for Trade, Transport, Tourism, et cetera, is that tourism is going to be affected and worst of 
<br/>all or most of all, what is most hurtful is those small businesses that exist outside these particular 
<br/>zones that make substantial a lot of money. I urge and I plead, “Please, do not do this.  It is 
<br/>counterproductive to what all of our citizens actually like seeing around our country.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1559 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, just a few  contributions from this side of the 
<br/>House, Sir. I am glad that the former Minister for Tourism and Trade actually mentioned Standing 
<br/>Order 51. I thought I would just share some statistics with him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the time of the previous Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they passed 318 Bills and out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of that, 298 Bills came under Standing Order 51 - 93.7 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, just to re-echo what the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had said, Mr. Speaker, Sir,…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, my Point of Order is on relevance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What Point of Order are you rising? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Standing Order 74 on relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- So, you make up your mind, honourable Member. If not, then you call for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>another order again. Can I allow the Deputy Prime Minister to continue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, I have decided, Standing Order 64 on relevance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, you have just decided whilst you  are standing there.  When someone 
<br/>calls for a Point of Order, please, quote the Standing Order number that you are raising so that will 
<br/>help me understand where we are going and what you are bringing to the floor. That is all I ask, 
<br/>honourable Maharaj.  You are a veteran politician.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  allow  me  to  return  to  that 
<br/>percentage, 93.7 percent of the legislations that,  that side of the House passed was actually  done 
<br/></span><span>under Standing Order 51.  So, going back to the point that the honourable Attorney-General made, 
<br/></span><span>leuta mada mai na malamala mai na matamu</span><span>. I will move along. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, I think one of the things that happened with the FijiFirst Party is that, they have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actually lost touch with reality. Let me explain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in the last 16 years, there has been a breakdown of society - asocial breakdown of society.  
<br/>Every Member in this Parliament, including those in the Chamber, will totally agree with me that 
<br/>there has been a social breakdown. What are the reasons?  It is what we are debating here today - the 
<br/></span><span>hours of nightclubs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I just want to say something else before I just assure Parliament and other honourable 
<br/>Members  that we did  consult  widely. Apart  from the consultations that the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General made, we actually did our own consultations which I will share.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>1560 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, before I do that, Sir, I will just remind the other side of the House, this is another 
<br/>point about this former Government. We have been talking about glue sniffing and ills. The Bill that 
<br/>was supposed to prevent glue sniffing was actually tabled in their Cabinet in 2010 called the Volatile 
<br/>Substance Abuse Bill.  No political will, Mr. Speaker, Sir, absolutely, no political will!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the problems  in  the economy  being  at  the feet  of the former 
<br/>Prime Minister and the former Attorney-General, I  place the social breakdown as well at their feet, 
<br/>Sir. Absolute ignorance and absolute no care! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me just to finally contribute on the Bill.  We did consult widely.  
<br/>We actually did our own survey and I will just read out the statistics. We did actually do a night base 
<br/>survey  in  May  and  the  night  survey  was  undertaken  in  Lami,  Suva  City,  Laucala  Bay,  Nabua  to 
<br/>Centrepoint  and  covered  all  the  food  operators,  BBQ  stalls,  market  vendors,  subway  stalls, 
<br/>restaurants, kava bars, taverns, service stations, taxi operators, shop operators and others.  About 98 
<br/>percent responded altogether, 66 percent were male and 34 percent were female. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  57  percent  agreed  that  the  club  hours  need  to  be  shortened;  64  percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responded and agreed that it should not be shortened between12.00 a.m. and 1.00 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, unlike that side of Parliament, we believe that we have consulted widely. 
<br/>The Churches are with us. We are doing this not because we are trying to repress the economy, we 
<br/>are doing this because a government not only does make popular decisions, they have to make social 
<br/>decisions, hard decisions in the interest of the people of Fiji.  This Government that will lead the new 
<br/>Fiji, Sir, is actually on the right path, I think, in changing the hours of club trading.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr  .Speaker,  I  rise  to  make  my  contribution  on  the  Bill  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament and, in this case, the provisions of the Act which is the opening hours of the nightclub.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as much as we want to solve some of the pressing social issues we are currently 
<br/>facing as a country, . I am sorry to say and inform the honourable Attorney-General that you cannot 
<br/>solve or decrease the crime rate by reducing the opening hours of the nightclub.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of consultations, we also do consultations not only for the sake of doing it but to 
<br/>gather the information and views of the people and those who are impacted by the Bill that is before 
<br/>Parliament.  Not that  you do consultations, you have already had a motive in doing consultations but 
<br/>I guess the onus is in this Parliament, if we do consultations, we listen to all the parties that is involved  
<br/>with the Bill that is currently in front of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just two aspects of those who are badly impacted by the Bill, just on the 
<br/>nightclub owners and families.  I have had a chance to </span><span>talanoa </span><span>with a nightclub owner just a few 
<br/>days ago, and he said, "In the consultations that they had  with the honourable Attorney-General”, all 
<br/>the nightclub owners disagreed with the Bill that is in front of us. They were saying, “Just as we were 
<br/>recovering after COVID-19and we were about to get on our feet, now this comes back in.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this nightclub owner, he had to sell three of his properties.  His family was also made to 
<br/>suffer but just as they were about to recover the revenue that was lost during COVID-19, the Bill 
<br/></span><span>comes in again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other aspect of my contribution today was on the families who do rely 
<br/>on the nightlife industry, especially in the cities.  There are families who have food stalls, they do 
<br/>rely on this nightlife to earn income.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1561 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have just passed the National Budget and all the honourable Members on the other side 
<br/>knows that VAT has been increased to 15 percent.  With the families that will be impacted, is this 
<br/>the right way treat them?  Guess, the amount of people that do rely on these operations in order to 
<br/>earn income and support their families back at home?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there are employees of these nightclubs that do rely on their jobs everyday.  According 
<br/>to some of the nightclub owners, if this Bill goes ahead, some people will lose their work and not 
<br/>only their work, there are also families back at home who rely on them who will greatly suffer. Thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to share my contribution with regards to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Bill in the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> language.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not an easy debate because the matter at 
<br/>hand is something that we all know about.  Liquor, during our early days, and most of us are still 
<br/>enjoying that particular path of the journey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  listened  to  remarks  by  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  I  have  decided  to  label  his 
<br/>presentation as a ‘righteous approach versus the right approach’. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ‘a 
<br/>righteous approach versus the right approach’.  This particular issue at hand demands or calls for the 
<br/>right approach and the right interventions, the right approach, because as the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance has schooled us about in his opening remarks is that everything is related or connected to 
<br/>everything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This touches the hearts and the souls of the tourism sector, it touches the hearts and souls of 
<br/>the livelihood of many, it also touches the hearts and the souls of our young people, it curtails the 
<br/>fundamentals of rights and freedoms, and many others.  So it is a very sensitive issue and a very 
<br/>difficult matter to debate about, and I am just wondering whether we have spent enough time on the 
<br/>consultation processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular issue is not really about liquor, it is just a very small element of it; it is not 
<br/>about just closing the special zones; it is deeply rooted in our society, in our lives and in our families, 
<br/></span><span>especially  for  mum  and  dads  who  sleep  on  their  job  at  home;  the  communities  are  not  working 
<br/></span><span>together to intervene in the journey of the young people, community-organised bodies, the churches 
<br/>and so forth.  I am calling for an intervention that is right, not a righteous intervention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I as the former Commissioner of Police and Corrections, I have served in a 
<br/>role that I have seen and as my mission demanded of me to keep the community or the public on 
<br/>track, that is, the Police role.  On the other side as the Commissioner of Corrections, inside the walls, 
<br/>was to bring back on track the lives of those who have gone off track. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to share with you, listening to young people who end up on the other side or even 
<br/></span><span>hearing of stories of those who have gone off track out here, and those who are inside the walls, not 
<br/>everything is related to liquor.  It is deeply rooted on other issues and on other matters, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  So, I am calling for, on behalf of my colleagues on this side of Parliament, that we should be 
<br/>very  sensitive  and  careful  as  we  address  this  particular  Bill,  that  we  consider  the  other  factors 
<br/>associated with it.  There are other alternatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1563 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  particular  Act  when  it  was  enacted  was  done  specifically  for  specific  reasons  -  for 
<br/>economic, social and above all from the security aspects of things, to control drinking spots, stop 
<br/>bootleggers or black markets, so are we prepared to when we make a tick on this one here, to see 
<br/>more drinking spots out  there?  Are we prepared to have more black markets out there?  Are we 
<br/>prepared to see more unsafe neighbourhood and community spots out there?  These are the questions 
<br/>we ask ourselves, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So I am strongly, on behalf of this side, we need to reconsider 
<br/>before we say, ‘aye’ to this particular Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  make  a  short  contribution.    From  the 
<br/>perspective of my portfolio as the Minister for Home Affairs, particularly with regards to the Police 
<br/>and the maintenance of law and order, and I appreciate the comments that have already been shared 
<br/>in Parliament, particularly the comments raised by former Police Commissioner and Commissioner 
<br/>of Corrections, some of the experiences related to excessive alcohol consumption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of us  come around Sunday morning along the Suva Bus Station,  it is  a pitiful sight 
<br/>around 7 o’clock and 8 o’clock when we witness our young people coming back after the nightclub 
<br/>closes at these hours.  In the day, we witness them because we see things that they do and how they 
<br/>affect other people’s lives whom they meet along the way. The least I can say is that it is not quite a 
<br/>good experience.  So this has been happening quite a while from when these laws were passed to 
<br/>allow nightclubs to operate for long hours.  Obviously, for the reasons for this was created and I must 
<br/>add also because one of the reasons that was given at the time was because of tourism, to allow our 
<br/>tourists to enjoy, particularly in Nadi not so much in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the last time the honourable Koya and I, I think it was Saturday when we walked, but 
<br/>roundabout 1 o’ clock in the morning, there were no tourist in the nightclub.  Obviously, they go to 
<br/>their places, so it was just the youth.  It is a matter of choice.  However, when people make choices, 
<br/>sometimes things go out of hand.  And when it takes into account law and order, it is a big problem 
<br/>for the Police, and honourable Naivalurua will agree with me.  Of course he was the Commissioner 
<br/>of Corrections, he would not realise, but there are lots of crime that are caused or related to alcohol 
<br/>consumption against our children and women, in particular. Much of the brawl are about men but 
<br/>most of the victims are our children and women.   It is not going to stop it and you are right, but it is 
<br/>definitely, Mr. Speaker, an important decision to be able to reduce the amount of oxygen that starts 
<br/>the fire.   That is what we are trying to do here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the honourable Members of this Parliament, assure all 
<br/>of our people, that one thing we consider and value are the lives of the people who become victims 
<br/></span><span>of excessive consumption of alcohol.  That is what we are trying to prevent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand there are other sequences.  Of course, every decision has a benefit and the cost, 
<br/>but let us look at our children.  During my time on the other side, I have always advocated for this 
<br/>because I see no social value.  They may be beneficial to our operators, may be in terms of revenue, 
<br/>but in terms of the long term costs, it has definitely impacted the social cost of this and the Police 
<br/>because of their already stressed resources, it is very hard to consistently effect this, but we will do 
<br/>our best.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recognise the point raised by honourable Naivalurua and that was a concern.  But whether 
<br/></span><span>it stops at five or stops at one, they still go back to their own homes.  So I suggest that may be, if 
<br/>people want to drink alcohol, to up to 5 o’ clock just go home peacefully and that is the best way to 
<br/>have it - under the supervision of your parents, and have a good time, because I am sure those who 
<br/>consume alcohol, as I had in the past till 5 o’ clock, there is only one cost, it empties my pocket and 
<br/>Alipate Vosaicake knows that, if he is listening.  That is the only reason. But, we will, obviously, 
<br/>going to assist the Police, Mr. Speaker, and I support the amendment Bill that we have.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the views expressed - frank, accurate, but may 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not reveal the truth.  Highest sound in language is good, but what is needed here is action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem here is, if I refer to honourable Naivalurua, we cannot legislate 
<br/>how good parents will teach their children, how the church should conduct their faiths, but what we 
<br/>can control here is what actions we will take to solve the problem that we face.  Let just refer to some 
<br/>of the views expressed by members of the community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadi is like a Beirut.  We all know Beirut.  That is the sentiment expressed by the owner of 
<br/>McDonalds, Mark McGregor.  Another comment; residents see more drunkards than animals lying 
<br/>on the roadside in Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I live in Nadi too. I go to Martintar to buy food and the problem, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this, the 
<br/>Act was aimed at tourists but really, it is locals and the use of locals is what has been expressed by 
<br/>the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One particular ethnic group is being affected here, and this is a social problem.  We are not 
<br/>going to touch on that because the Ministry of Home Affairs has highlighted what action they will 
<br/>take.  The Ministry of iTaukei have steps.  The question here is, as parliamentarians, as leaders, the 
<br/>measurement of our leadership is the strong position we take and that is the reason we have taken it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have not taken away the right for someone to go and enjoy themselves. They can drink 
<br/>until 1.00 a.m.  We have not taken away the right for small businesses to operate, but what we have 
<br/>provided is an enabling environment that people can go home, the streets are free at 5.00 a.m. so that 
<br/>the people of Nadi who walk in the morning can enjoy their safety.  That is the crux of the issue here, 
<br/>nothing else! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- We want to resolve that problem, and that is the legacy we want to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leave behind in July 2023…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- …restrict the hours, safety to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- If I may just resort briefly in a vernacular, </span><span>sa rauta mada.  Rauta, sa 
<br/>rauta, na mateni.  O Nadi me lesu tale ki na vanua ko a kilai kina.</span><span> From Fiji Airways in Nasoso, then

<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I sit as a Magistrate in Nadi and this is one thing 
<br/>that I want to share - straight from Martintar, to the cell, to court, and to prison.  The abuse, violence 
<br/>against women, children are neglected, those are the issues embedded here.
