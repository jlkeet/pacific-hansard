<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I conclude, I want to share this with you, honourable Members, as I would certainly 
<br/>be making preparation as to how I could prepare a paper for your decision honourable Members as 
<br/>to how we are going to be sitting and addressing this long sitting.  I fully understand it is quite tiring 
<br/>when we go right to the early hours of the morning but I must apologise because the Secretariat and 
<br/>its hardworking team have tried to fit in everything as approved by the Business Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I am kind of informing you in advance now because we would like to 
<br/>see how best we can address this and bring it to your attention for our approval and decision as well.  
<br/>Do we extend the sitting, so we finish early because honourable Ministers have to carry out their 
<br/>duties as well as well as you honourable Members and most importantly the hardworking staff of 
<br/>Parliament.
