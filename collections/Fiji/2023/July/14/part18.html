<div><span>Review Report of the Convention on Cybercrime  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  is  a  Review  of  the  Convention  on 
<br/></span><span>Cybercrime  also  known  as  the  Budapest  Convention  that  was  tabled  in  Parliament  on  the  1st 
<br/></span><span>September, 2022 and recommended that Fiji ratify the Convention without reservation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Review  Report  was  still  at  the  Committee  deliberation  phase  when  Parliament  was 
<br/>dissolved on 30th October, 2022. The previous Committee had received 18 submissions both oral 
<br/>and written and had begun formulating the review report. This pending Report on the Convention on 
<br/>Cybercrime was reinstated in this new term of Parliament.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence reviewed the verbatim reports from 
<br/>the  last  Committee’s  deliberations  and  called  three  other  submissions  and  received  a  second  oral 
<br/>submission from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration which was in addition to their written 
<br/>submission that was submitted to the previous Committee.  The submissions were from a wide range 
<br/>of backgrounds  including  government  agencies,  regional bodies, Non-Government  Organisations, 
<br/>private ICT companies, private individuals, universities, commercial banks, UN agencies, a Treaty 
<br/>Specialist, the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit, legal practitioners and law enforcement. I thank them 
<br/>for their submissions and the Committee is grateful for their contribution towards the completion of 
<br/>this review Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has also included in this Report some consequential actions that need to be 
<br/>taken  after  Fiji  ratifies  the  Convention  as  recommended  by  some  of  the  submissions,  which  are 
<br/>mostly amendments to some existing legislation and the recommendation from the Ministry of Home 
<br/>Affairs  to  reassign  the  Cybercrime  Act  from  the  Ministry  of  Communications  to  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>portfolio.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  understands  that  these  recommendations  are  beyond  its  Cyber  Crime 
<br/>Convention  review  mandate  as  they  deal  with  national  legislations,  however,  the  Committee  has 
<br/>highlighted them in this Report to reflect the views and concerns of agencies that have a role to play 
<br/>in dealing with cybercrime.  Suffice to say, that there were overwhelming support for the ratification 
<br/>of the Convention, given the opportunity it provides to build capacity and to cooperate with countries 
<br/>that are leading the fight against the cybercrime.  Because of the cross-border nature of cybercrime, 
<br/>cooperation between States and private industry is critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  Fiji’s  accession  to  the  Convention  will  greatly  contribute  to  the  overall 
<br/>development of cyber security for Fiji.  As such, the Committee recommends to Parliament that Fiji 
<br/>ratifies  the  Convention  without  reservations,  and  that  Parliament  take  note  of  the  Committee’s 
<br/>comments under other recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members of the current and 
<br/>previous Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  On behalf of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to  Standing  Orders  121(1)(b)  and 
<br/></span><span>130(4)(a), the Standing Committee has  now reported back and Parliament  will now await further 
<br/></span><span>notification from the honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Annual Report of the Ministry of Fisheries for 2018-2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present this Consolidated 
<br/>Report of the Standing Committee on Natural  Resources, which  covers the Annual  Report of the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries for 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In accordance with the established Annual Report review process, the Committee examines 
<br/></span><span>Annual Reports of agencies to investigate, inquire into, and make recommendations relating to the 
<br/>agencies’  administration,  legislative  or  proposed  legislative  programme,  budget,  rationalisation, 
<br/>restructuring, functions, structure and policy formulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  part  of  this  process,  the  Committee  formulated  questions  and  received  the  written 
<br/>responses  from  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  for  additional  information.    This  review  was  made  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1587 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(c) which mandate the Committee to look into issues related 
<br/>to  forestry,  agriculture,  mining,  environment,  fisheries,  water  and  marine  services.    The  review 
<br/>looked at the Ministry’s administration structure, budgetary allocation, programmes and activities, 
<br/>policies, challenges and achievements of the years under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, the Committee commended the overall performance and achievements of 
<br/>the Ministry of Fisheries during the review period.  In addition to the achievements in 2018 to 2021 
<br/>years, one of the highlights of the Ministry was that it had cleared all its outstanding audit issues of 
<br/>previous  years  and  obtained  unqualified  audit  for  its  last  two  financial  reports  from  the  Auditor- 
<br/>General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Review Committee noted the Ministry of Fisheries had established the Coastal Fisheries 
<br/>Management Division with nine staff to assist in the inshore fisheries policy and inshore operation 
<br/>in compliance management.  This new Division was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
<br/>Affairs and Trade (NZ/MFAT).    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was also noted that the Ministry of Fisheries undertook reforms in 2019 whereby it revised 
<br/>and improved its vision, mission, strategies and core values.  It also identified its 10 Critical Success 
<br/>Factors. The Committee noted the diligent performance of the staff despite the challenges, and that 
<br/>the Ministry is working towards achieving goals for quick economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my appreciation to the Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Atelaite Rokosuka and 
<br/>staff of the Ministry of Fisheries, and the relevant stakeholders for their timely contributions in the 
<br/>final compilation of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  valuable  contribution  of  the  Committee  Members  namely,  our 
<br/>Chairman the honourable Inia Seruiratu, honourable Iliesa Vanawalu, honourable Tomasi Tunabuna 
<br/>and the alternate Members honourable Jone Usamate, honourable Joseph Nand, honourable Sakiusa 
<br/>Tubuna and honourable Alitia Bainivalu.  I thank the Secretariat for their endless contribution.

<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Review Report of the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence  on  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  National 
<br/>Security 2017-2018 Annual Report.   This  Annual  Report  was  tabled  on  29th  July,  2022  in  the 
<br/>previous Parliament term and was reinstated in this new Parliament term.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Standing Committee on Foreign  Affairs and Defence received a written and 
<br/>verbal  submission  from  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  National  Security  and  had  commenced 
<br/>deliberation and formulating this review Report. This Committee did not receive nor ask for new 
<br/>submissions but continued from where the previous Committee left off.  However, the Committee 
<br/>requested for an update on the pending papers highlighted in the Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  reviewed  both  the  Annual  Report  and  the  verbatim  from  the  submissions 
<br/>made to the previous Committee in the process of finalising this Report.  The recommendations in 
<br/>this Report are made as applicable to the reporting period of the Annual Report.  I make this point to 
<br/>underscore  the  fact  that  a  lot  has  been  done  by  the  Ministry  up  to  now  and  there  has  been 
<br/>announcements  made  by  the  current  honourable  Minister  along  the  vein  of  some  of  the 
<br/>recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  commends  the  good  work  of  the  organisation  in  progressing  this  Annual 
<br/>Report.    While  applauding  the  achievements  of  the  Ministry,  the  Committee  had  identified  some 
<br/>opportunities for improvements, and these are outlined in the Report.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  wishes  to  congratulate  the  Ministry  on  the  gender  representation  chart 
<br/>reflected in the Report and recommends that it takes note of the recommendation on this matter in 
<br/>this Report.  I take this opportunity to thank the honourable Minister, the Permanent Secretary and 
<br/>all staff including their families for a job well done and their dedication to securing the nation for all 
<br/>Fijians and all visitors that come to our shores.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  take  this  opportunity  to  also  thank  the  previous  and  current  members  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for compiling this bipartisan Report.  On behalf of the 
<br/>Standing on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VANAWALU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service Annual Reports 2016-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order 
<br/>32(2) of the Standing Orders of Parliament, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/>Rights  was  referred  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  Annual  Report  on  2nd  December,  2021.  This 
<br/></span><span>Annual Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were the Ministry of Civil Service Annual Reports from 2016 to 
<br/></span><span>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee of the previous term was mandated to review the Annual 
<br/>Reports and tabled its findings back to Parliament.  However, it could not do so due to the dissolution 
<br/>of Parliament in which the former Committee had to suspend its work without completing the review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1589 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Annual Reports were re-instated in the current Parliamentary term of 2022 to 2026 and 
<br/>with your instructions, Sir, these Reports were then referred to the current Standing Committee on 
<br/>Monday, 13th February, for review.  With anticipation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee inherited 
<br/>the mandate of the previous Committee and took on the responsibility of completing the review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By way of a brief background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Civil Service was established 
<br/>in the year 2016 following the abolishment of the Public Service Commission in December 2015.  
<br/>As it was intentionally designed, the Ministry of Civil Service was to support Government ministries 
<br/>in carrying out their constitutional functions whilst maintaining its central coordination of key areas 
<br/>to ensure consistency across the Civil Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  captures  the  review  findings  and  recommendations  of  the 
<br/>Committee with respect to pertinent issues noted from the contents of the Ministry of Civil Service 
<br/>Annual Report from 2016 to 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may highlight some of the main key findings that have been identified 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during the review in which the Committee noted, the Ministry has - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>re-strategised its efforts to address unresolved complaints from the public; 
<br/>also introduced strategical methods of reducing its cost of operations by realigning its 
<br/>human resource and financial system; 
<br/>put  emphasis  on  improving  staff  work  related  capabilities  by  increasing  capacity 
<br/>building programmes; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4)</span><span> </span><span>made significant strides in accomplishing its goals towards SDG5 and SDG16 with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduction of certain policies; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5)</span><span> </span><span>made a notable transition from the Public Service Commission to the Ministry of Civil 
<br/>Service by continuing the core functions of PSC in issuing standard guidelines across 
<br/>Government Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the OMRS system, the Ministry has made significant strides in its effort towards  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gender equality by achieving 59 percent of female representation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  conclusion  of  the  review,  the  Committee  believes  that  the  majority  of  the  issues 
<br/>identified  have  been  adequately  addressed  and  it  would  only  be  proper  that  I  acknowledge  the 
<br/>previous Committee members for the tremendous work done and also the Ministry of Civil Service 
<br/>for collaborating efficiently on matters that were required by the current  Committee to pursue its 
<br/></span><span>review process. A big thank you to the Permanent Secretary and his staff on their consultation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  believes  that  it  would  be  prudent  also  to 
<br/>compliment  the  findings  that  were  identified  and  provide  the  following  recommendations  for 
<br/>consideration of the Ministry of Civil Service as well as for this august Parliament to take note. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recommendations  noted  by  the  Committee  are  as  follows.    The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee recommends that the Ministry of Civil Service -  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provides  a  timely  submission  of  its  Annual  Report  to  Parliament  for  effective  and 
<br/></span><span>efficient review by Standing Committees; 
<br/>responds  to  the  issues  raised  by  the  Committee  which  it  believes  specifies  the 
<br/>improvements and progress made and be noted in the Ministry’s next Annual Report; 
<br/>continues to build its human resource capacity with an area focused on the gap between 
<br/>new incoming civil servants and civil servant retirees; 
<br/>implements a policy that should bond graduates to Civil Service to serve within Fiji;

<div><span>Review Report - Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the Review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2018-
<br/>2019 Annual Report.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, before going into the Report, I would like to pay tribute to

<br/>at his village tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Luke Ratuvuki attended the Navuso Agricultural School and studied Agriculture Science 
<br/></span><span>at  Bangalore  University  in  India.    He  came  back  and  rose  through  the  ranks  of  the  Ministry  of

<br/>this country diligently and contributed significantly to the development of the agriculture sector.  We

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1591 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While deliberating on the Report, the Committee noted the benefits of the CEO’s forum held 
<br/>by FRCS annually and recommended for forums of such nature to be held at least on a bi-annual 
<br/>basis to further strengthen engagement with stakeholders. The FRCS plays a significant role, so it is 
<br/>important to maintain a strong relationship with its stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the fourteen (14) Memorandums of Understanding signed during the 
<br/>period  under  review  and  recommended  that  these  stakeholders  work  in  collaboration  to  ensure 
<br/>compliance at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted with concern the significant increase in debtors, due to outstanding fees 
<br/>and  charges  as  well  as  a  significant  increase  in  outstanding  VAT  refunds.  The  Committee 
<br/>recommended that more practical measures be pursued to alleviate these matters. Furthermore, the 
<br/>Committee noted the various services and programmes introduced by FRCS such as Tax Talk which 
<br/>appear  in  newspaper  articles  and  Border  Control  TV  Shows  and  recommends  that  continuous 
<br/>awareness sessions be conducted so that people are able to understand the compliance requirements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced  this  Report  –  honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable  Sachida 
<br/>Nand, honourable Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro F. Tuisawau. I also take this opportunity to 
<br/>acknowledge and thank the Parliamentary staff who have given us invaluable support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Review of the

<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to 
<br/>Parliament a Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Development Bank 2020-2021 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Fiji Development Bank achieved a net profit of $0.99 million 
<br/>in comparison to $1.14 million in the 2020 financial year. Furthermore, the lending portfolio recorded 
<br/>profits  for  both  years  -  $541.88  million  in  2020  and  it  grew  to  $618.81  million  in  2021  despite 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bank witnessed the impacts of the novel Coronavirus pandemic, tropical cyclones and 
<br/>subsequent floods.  The Bank then implemented strategies that prioritized business continuity and 
<br/>resilience.
