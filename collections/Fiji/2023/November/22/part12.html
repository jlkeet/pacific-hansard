Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; Hon. Minister for Health and Medical Services; Hon. Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts; Hon. Minister for Education; Hon. Minister for Youth and Sports; and Hon. Minister for Agriculture and Waterways.

There will be no other debate. Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All – APEC Leaders Meeting HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, good morning to you and to the honourable Members and also, to our friends and those interested in the affairs of Parliament and the affairs of Fiji who have joined us in the gallery this morning, and those who are watching the live telecast of the proceedings of this august Parliament; ni sa bula vinaka. I trust that life goes on and we are all enjoying it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to start on a solemn note to announce the death of a loyal servant of Fiji, former Secretary to Government, Secretary of the Public Service Commission, Ambassador and even Cabinet Minister, the late Poseci Waqalevu Bune, who passed away early this morning at the Nadi Private Hospital. Earlier this week, we had one of our local daily newspapers highlighting the fact of the number of deaths due to prostate cancer. I would like to reiterate the words of the writers of that article and the doctors who called upon men of Fiji to get clearance, get tested and make sure you are fine. Our condolences go to the late Mr. Bune’s relatives. I was fortunate to be able to divert my return journey on a recent visit to go and talk to him in the RSL Hotel in Lautoka. He sounded very well and strong, but I knew he was not well. So, our condolences go out to his relatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise today to report to this august Parliament on my recent participation in the 30 th Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Week. I was invited as a guest economy by President Joseph Biden - the President of the United States. Fiji is not a member of APEC, but we could be invited by the Leaders of countries that are members of APEC. Last week’s meeting focussed on the theme, “Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All”.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>2098</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the premier platform for the United States to advance its economic policies in the Asia-Pacific region has been APEC, for some time. It promotes free, fair and open trade, and advances sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The 21 APEC Member Economies account for nearly 40 percent of the global population, 50 percent of global trade and more than 60 percent of US goods exports. Additionally, Sir, these economies have investments in the United States estimated at 1.7 trillion dollars and employing 2.3 million American workers as of 2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, APEC 2023 brought Leaders, Ministers, the private sector and other stakeholders together, to engage in discussions on the global challenges. The Leaders Meeting provided a platform to advocate for immediate and urgent action to address the impacts of climate change. I addressed the Leaders on the topic, “Sustainability, Climate and Just Transitions on Energy”. Those who are going to the next COP meeting will be including the honourable Leader of the Opposition because he has been involved in these talks before and will continue this discussion at the COP discussions. In my address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Leaders to take affirmative action in terms of trade and investment, aligning our ambitions for a ‘Zone of Peace’. I continue to promote that, Sir. I first mentioned it at the UN General Assembly, and I am continuing to promote the “Zone of Peace” in the Pacific with a just transition towards a sustainable future. Fiji’s emphasis on sustainability, climate, and a just energy transition is grounded in the imperative to protect our people, preserve our cultural identity and ensure economic stability. Given our high disaster risk profile and limited access to transformational technologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appealed to APEC Leaders to aid the Pacific in addressing the immediate and urgent threats of climate change. Our involvement in events like APEC is not merely symbolic but a strategic and pragmatic approach to advancing Fiji’s interests and our development goals. During the Leaders Week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also participated in the Investor Forum of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Forum. The discussions centred on collaborative actions to increase private investment in the Indo-Pacific region. Fiji fully supports the vision of a greener global economy, as articulated under IPEF. That aligns with the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, emphasising the need for nations to coexist peacefully and collaborate on trans-boundary issues, including climate change. Mr. Speaker, to realise that vision and respond to climate change, sustainable investment in infrastructure and innovation is imperative. Our firsthand experiences with the effects of the climate crises, underscores the urgent need for coordinated actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, investment in resilient trade-related infrastructure, such as the trans-Pacific submarine cables as discussed yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co- operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, is crucial for our economic growth and regional economic integration.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2099 Google commitment to investing in trans-Pacific submarine cables is a promising development, enhancing capacity and fostering economic growth in Fiji and the Pacific region. In line with these efforts, the Government is fast-tracking Fiji’s transition to a greener future, mobilising finance for green investments and exploring avenues to de-risk investments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent launch of Fiji’s first (not FijiFirst) Sovereign Blue Bond, the bond issue was oversubscribed three times. We were hoping for $20 million and $60 million was subscribed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, agreements forged and partnership established through IPEF are pivotal to enhancing our integration into the global economy and advancing the goals of the Blue Pacific Continent. Interestingly, Sir, when I asked the honourable Deputy Prime Minister if he knows how much capital we have locally available, he said that it would be a very good idea if we can do another one, and then another one. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the sidelines of APEC, a bilateral meeting was conducted with His Excellency President Xi Jingping of the People’s Republic of China. That was before I challenged him and President Biden to get together again and talk about peace in the world. I said that when everyone was sitting around, listening, and they all smiled with hope. That bilateral, Mr. Speaker, Sir, presented a valuable opportunity to enhance our economic and diplomatic ties with China. We have had diplomatic relationship with China since 1973. Before that, we had it with what we now know as ‘Taipei’ because they were the China when Fiji became independent. But when the United Nations recognised the People’s Republic of China as ‘China’, countries and governments around the world switched their recognition of China from Taipei or Taiwan, to the People’s Republic of China, now known simply as China. China’s global initiatives, notably the Belt and Road Initiative, align with our nation’s development agenda. President Xi’s Global Development Initiative provides a timely call to action, to address the challenges hindering the progress to implement sustainable development goals. We commend China’s unwavering commitment to tackling climate change. Additionally, the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) stands out as a transformative force that can empower nations to shape their own destinies. We also support China’s Global Security Initiative aimed at establishing a diplomatic and security architecture based on multilateral treaties, alliances and institutions. We intend to participate in those, in our promotion of the Pacific as a regional zone of peace. That aligns with my advocacy for the “Pacific as a Zone of Peace”, reflecting our shared vision for global security. I reaffirmed our commitment to the One-China Policy, the cornerstone of our formal diplomatic relations for nearly five decades. China’s recent contributions to Fiji include the COVID recovery package, grants assistance for infrastructural rehabilitation, and the establishment of a regional centre for Juncao Technology, that have been pivotal to Fiji’s post-COVID economic recovery. As we navigate economic challenges, discussions are underway to address our debt crisis responsibly. A key focus for Fiji’s sustainable economic growth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the comprehensive upgrade and expansion of our infrastructure, particularly the modernisation of port facilities and shipyards. I anticipate potential collaboration with China in that endeavour, given China’s globally competitive shipbuilding methods.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>2100</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 In my capacity as Minister responsible for climate change and environment (for the time being), I expressed keen interest in learning from China’s experience in industrial recycling processes, particularly in Guangdong Province, a province we have had a very long association with. We had a Tripartite Meeting with the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister and the President of Indonesia, President Joko Widodo. On the sidelines of the meeting, we had that meeting and the tail- end of that, I got invited by the President of Indonesia. The meeting marked a significant step in addressing regional concerns, particularly regarding West Papua. Our discussion with President Widodo focused on fostering dialogue and expressing respect for the sovereignty of States. Prime Minister James Marape, and I, were recently appointed as Special Envoys to Indonesia by the Melanesian Spearhead Group and the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, to go and talk to the leadership of Indonesia about the plights of our kinsmen of West Papua, who are Melanesians like us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, APEC as a multilateral forum, provided the opportunity to hold crucial bilateral even trilateral meetings to promote our nation’s interest as well as free, fair and open trade to foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth. I extend my gratitude for the support of this august House and look forward to furthering our nation’s growth and prosperity through continued engagement on the international stage. There has been a lot of anti-trip comments and I will address that in the motion later on today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I open the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for the reply, it would be remiss of me not to show our appreciation to the great achievement that the country of Fiji has gained. They have been invited to attend the APEC meeting, not as a member but they have been invited and the amount of goodies that you brought back to the country from that particular meeting and the side meeting is something to be acknowledged. So we thank you sincerely, honourable Prime Minister and your Government for that. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister, I also wish to pay tribute now, knowing that the late Poseci Bune has also passed on. We do convey our sincere condolence as well to his family for the sad passing of Mr. Bune. I also wish to pay tribute to the passing of the late Justice Kamal Kumar who, unfortunately, was called home yesterday in the afternoon and we also convey our sincere condolences to the family - his son who is here in Fiji and, of course, to his wife and son who are in Brisbane, Australia. They were sons of Fiji who have contributed significantly, and we are with their families during this time of sorrow. I also wish to welcome our friends from Australia who are here in Parliament, and we hope that they will enjoy their short stay here in Fiji. We do appreciate, honourable Prime Minister, the statement that you have made yesterday. I know for a fact that there were some anti-comments, but it is vital that Government, your Office and all the agencies of Government are aware of the trips and the reasons behind it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I say this because when the request was made by Government to cancel last week’s Parliament sitting, I raised, “why do we need to cancel this Sitting?”</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2101 The reasons that were given by the Leader of Government Business in Parliament said, “Oh, the honourable Prime Minister is attending the MSG Meeting, the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting and preparation for COP28”, but in the evening news before that, we have already seen the honourable Prime Minister landing in the Cook Islands. He has had his meeting with the MSG Leaders and, of course, with the Pacific Islands Forum. So, it took place a week before we were supposed to sit which was last week. The COP 28 is going to be happening next week, so we do not see the logic behind it, but we understand the importance of such meetings. Again, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, this is your responsibility, and we support you because this is beneficial for Fiji. Fiji is punching above its own weight when it comes to our representation in the international forum. You have alluded to it yesterday, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, through Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are small, we do not have much to influence in terms of political power, in terms of economic power, but it is about relevance. How do we make ourselves relevant in the context of the global issues that are happening? Of course, we need to take into consideration our interests, values and perceptions - that is very critical, and you have highlighted on a few of it this morning. We know how important trade is. We are living in a globalised world where connectivity, not only in terms of trade but customs and traditions, and there are so many impacts that are being brought about by globalisation. So how are we adapting to the changing environment? This is the relevance that I am talking about, Sir. Multilateralism, at some stage, was questioned, particularly when it comes to the global issues. Is multilateralism still effective? That is where our hope is as small island countries. We have been able to attend G20 meetings. Although not a member of APEC, we have now been invited. This is the level of representation, and it is a challenge for everyone here in this Parliament because when you go to global forums, they see Fiji differently and we need to rise to that and that is a challenge for all of us - the benefits that we get out of it. But when it comes to sustainable development and resiliency, money is not everything. I will say that again, money is not everything. What are the values that we want to protect? Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you have been talking about a region of peace. Of course, we need that peace, but how can we have peace when our very life is threatened because of climate change? Your statement in Australia on fossil fuel, particularly coal, compromises our position according to the Suva Declaration which was one of the key issues that we took with us into the Paris Agreement in COP and that also landed up in the text of the Paris Agreement. This is the interest that we want to protect. We need them, but at the same time, let us be honest with the issues that we bring, particularly because we have a responsibility, not only for the people of Fiji, but for the people of the region - sustainability and resilience. That is why our position must always be emphasised regardless of the gains and the benefits which we need because of our development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note, I am quite worried that the honourable Prime Minister has decided not to go to COP28. This is a responsibility that he should not and could not delegate. He has to take it by the horn and lead it from the front, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because this is the single and existential threat that is really going to be the biggest worry, not only for Pacific islanders but globally, particularly the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). We have talked about the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) yesterday and Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (BBNJ). Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a huge problem about internal displacement and forced migration. That is a biggest concern for Pacific Islanders today. What happens if Tuvalu goes under water? What happens if Kiribati goes underwater? What happens to their sovereignty? What will happen to their migration?</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>2102</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, internal displacement and forced migration are issues that our Leaders should take to COP because it threatens our existence. That is the region of peace that we want. How can we have peace when we are threatened? Human right is about life, we have a right to life and that is the issue that we want to take and fight for, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Our relationship with China is very important - the One China Policy and let us stick to that. It is not that we have neglected it, honourable Minister for Fisheries, it is not that we have treated China as a karate kid. China was with us when all our friends and partners deserted us, so let us maintain the One China Policy. We are thankful to the MSG for appointing the honourable Prime Minister and Prime Minister James Marape. Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we respect the sovereignty. but at the same time, it is our interests and values that we need to bring as well and we wish Prime Minister James Marape and our honourable Prime Minister every success in the meetings with Indonesia. That basically is what I wanted to say on the motion this morning on the Statement by the honourable Prime Minister. Again, we appreciate the work undertaken by the honourable Prime Minister and the gains that we get out of it, but let us not make compromises, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because in the end, we will be answerable to every Fijian and every Pacific Islander on the issue of the right to life, resilience and sustainability. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition, for that interesting reply in your response to the honourable Prime Minister’s Statement. Just to add on, honourable Prime Minister and honourable Members of the Government side, that is a very humble plea from the honourable Leader of the Opposition – our attendance in the next COP28 meeting and I sincerely hope that that humble plea will not fall on deaf ears. I am willing to step down and not lead my delegation in attending the COP28 meeting because of the climatic issue under IPU so that only two who are in charge of our Executive attend this very important meeting because we are worried about the plight of the Small Island States that has come out quite well in our recent meeting of the IPU in Angola as well. The plight of our Small Island States is a bit too late, honourable Prime Minister, to go on this emission reduction to 1.5 percent. The target was 2 percent but as we speak and as we contemplate things in these historic meetings, the islands are sinking. Our neighbours are suffering. Our taking over the Chair of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and heavily supported by the Office of the Speaker is just to show our concern regarding the plight that we are in and I must convey here that we were quite fortunate that the Australian Federal representation, led by the honourable Federal Speaker of Parliament, honourable Milton Dick, and supported by Senator honourable Deborah Mary O’Neil and a few others, that saw to this - raising and registering our concern regarding the plight of our Pacific people. There are 13 nations in the Pacific, and you have just come back from attending that meeting, honourable Prime Minister. You even attended this APEC Meeting, being invited by the President of the United States, but this is another meeting that all of us who have been attending these side meetings have come to realise that it is a bit too late. The islands are sinking. Our coastlines are sinking. What is there to be done? It can only be addressed in these very meetings that we are supposed to be attending. We will attend, honourable Prime Minister. But the plea from our side, it is now or never. The islands are sinking, and I plead very strongly to your good Office and to your goodself that our</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2103 plea will not be on deaf ears. I thank you and let us move on. Important Relationship Between Climate Change and Health HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement and before I do so, I just want to confirm to this august Parliament and to your good-self, Sir, that the honourable Prime Minister has taken heed of the plea from the honourable Leader of the Opposition and that he will now attend the COP 28 Meeting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet colleagues and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement on the issue of climate change and health. The relationship between climate change and health is undeniable and well documented such that climate change is now considered a single biggest health threat facing humanity of this century. Climate change contributes directly to humanitarian emergencies over the tropical storms, floods, heat waves, wildfires, rising sea levels, cyclones, hurricanes and they are increasing in scale frequency and intensity. The impacts are already harming health through disease outbreaks, physical injuries and trauma from extreme weather events, forced displacement as mentioned by honourable Leader of Opposition, food insecurity, air pollution and pressure on mental health. At the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, a number of health facilities have been identified since 2016 to be affected or at high risk from climate change impacts. Health facilities, such as Vatoa Nursing Station, Ogea Nursing Station and Nayau Nursing Station in the Eastern Division; Beqa Health Centre in the Central Division; Teci Nursing Station and Nacula Health Centre in the Western Division; and Saqani Health Centre and Tukavesi Health Centre in the Northern Division are affected by or at risk from rising sea levels. A number of them have been identified for urgent relocation. Korovisilou Health Centre is amongst our facilities at risk from flooding, while Qamea Health Centre as you would have known, Mr. Speaker, was destroyed by landslide and awaiting the construction of a replacement facility at a new site. Tonia Nursing Station which was also affected by landslide is also awaiting relocation, while the nurses’ quarters have been relocated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also note the climate change impact on the environment around our health facilities that have necessitated the need to consider the relocation of health facilities to improve access to health facilities by the local population. Tokaimalo Nursing Station in Ra is planned for relocation because the access bridge to the facilities have been damaged by flooding. Similarly, considerations are being taken for Laselevu Health Centre and Nasauvere Nursing Station in Naitasiri, given the assessed climate risks that exist for the current sites. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the impact on health infrastructure, every year the Ministry also continues to tackle multiple surges and outbreaks on climate sensitive diseases and leptospirosis, typhoid fever, dengue fever and diarrheal diseases in our population. On the optimistic side, it is estimated that avoiding the worst climate impacts by meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives worldwide each year and helps prevent 250,000 additional climate-related health deaths per year worldwide from 2030-2050 mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. On the environmental and health impact within the Pacific region, Mr. Speaker Sir, for Fiji and the Pacific region, the impact of climate change on health is no longer a theoretical proposition, but a visible everyday living reality. The devastation of severe tropical cyclones on human health,</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>2104</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 agriculture, environment, national and family economic health, and our social structures are inflicting its toll on our health and wellbeing. Rising sea levels are infiltrating arable land for farming and physical activity driving people towards processed calorie dense and nutrient poor foods, reducing opportunities for physical activities, thereby contributing further to the NCD crisis and malnutrition status in our communities. During the visit of the Director General of WHO, Dr. Tedros, to Tonga in 2019, he was shown a playing ground in which Fiji and Tonga played their first 15s rugby test match in 1924, now fully submerged underwater from the rising tides, and unusable – a story not uncommon in our coastal communities! Landslides from excessive rain have washed away homes and farms, and threatened whole communities that now warrant relocation, and inflicting additional emotional and mental trauma on its occupants. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change impact on health is threefold: (1) The direct impact caused by weather or climate extremes, resulting in injuries and illnesses during or after floods, droughts, windstorms and heat waves, and worsening the health conditions of the vulnerable in our communities particularly in the elderly, children and babies, pregnant mothers, disabled, and those with chronic diseases. (2) (3) It encompasses the impacts of environmental and ecological alterations due to climate change that impacts the geographical distribution and intensity of communicable diseases that spreads by vectors, rodents, food and water. It relates to the diverse health impacts on mental and emotional trauma and stress caused by social disruptions to communities, such as loss of belongings, homeland or natural resources. In tackling climate change and health, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our health systems are the main line of defence for populations faced with emerging health threats, including from climate change. To protect health and avoid widening health inequities imposed by the impact of climate change, our countries must build climate-resilient health systems. Acknowledging that the climate crisis is a health crisis and taking its cue from the aspirational vision of the 1995 Yanuca Declaration on Healthy Islands, Health Ministers of the Pacific have come together over the last three decades to advocate for, plan and promote mitigation and adaptation measures to tackle climate change impact on our health systems and communities. The 61 st World Health Assembly in 2008 endorsed that Member-States should support the work on the protection of human health from risks related to climate change. Since then, a number of critical global and regional mandates and initiatives such as the: • Madang Commitment of 2009; • Green Growth Framework for Fiji 2014; • Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Special Initiative on Climate Change and Health 2017; and • Pacific Islands Action Plan on Climate Change and Health 2018 have helped to highlight the impact of climate change and health in climate vulnerable regions such as Fiji.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2105 The action plans acknowledge that Fiji like other SIDs are among the countries most affected by a range of acute and long-term risks caused by climate change, and yet make a very small contribution to the overall global emissions. They also presented short-term and long-term actions and indicators along four strategic lines of action - empowerment; evidence; implementation; and resources. In 2015, the five-year research project titled, “Piloting Climate Change Adaptation to Protect Human Health” (PCCAPHH) undertaken in Fiji and six other participating countries - Barbados, Bhutan, China, Jordan, Kenya and Uzbekistan concluded amongst its findings that Leptospirosis, Typhoid fever, Dengue fever and Diarrhoeal diseases (LTDD) were Fiji’s climate sensitive diseases. Strong climate change political mandates such as the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement and the 2015 Suva Declaration where the leaders of Pacific Islands leaders called for increased support for adaptation measures that addresses all vulnerable sectors including health, water and sanitation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COP 26 meeting in Glasgow, United Kingdom in 2021 was an additional step forward in bringing human health to the forefront of climate change work with the UNFCCC for the first time including two key programmes to support countries in developing climate resilient and low carbon sustainable health systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of slow implementation, unfortunately, despite the high level of political attention and commitments and many countries identifying health as a priority sector vulnerable to climate change, a significant financing gap remains. Necessary actions to safeguard healthcare facilities and build climate resilience are delayed. These actions include: (1) Relocation of health facilities that are at risk from rising sea levels, floods and landslides; (2) Retrofitting of existing health facilities to become more climate resilient; (3) Repairs and refurbishment of facilities affected by cyclones; and (4) Reducing carbon emissions from health facilities through prudent utilisation of medical products and improved medical waste management. At the global level, public and private climate finance have doubled from 2011 to 2020 and is estimated to have reached up to $940 billion in 2021. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, less than 2 percent of multilateral climate finance goes to health projects, and this needs urgent addressing at global and national level as well. The mainstreaming of health considerations in climate change discussion and considerations at all levels nationally and globally over the last decade have been slower than what is required. In talking about Fiji’s actions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services acknowledges the work of all the previous governments on this important health determinant and is continuing its effort to address the impact of climate change on the health system and the health of the population in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to talk about the SHAPE project between the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, World Health Organisation as the project implementer and KOICA as the funder with a budget of US$6.4 million was delayed in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. The pace of the project has picked up and the outputs will contribute to the protection of the health of Fijians from the adverse effects of climate change. As for the intervention sites, the SHAPE project will be looking after: • Central Division</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2106</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Nasoqo Nursing Station, Navunikabi Nursing Station, Naililili Nursing Station, Verata Nursing Station and Nayavu Health Centre. • Eastern Division Ravitaki Nursing Station, Talaulia Nursing Station, Tuvuca Nursing Station, Lomaloma Health Centre and Lakeba Subdivisional Hospital. • Western Division Kamikamica Health Centre, Kese Health Centre, Nacula Health Centre, Lomawai Health Centre and Vatulele Health Centre. • Northern Division Naqumu Nursing Station in Macuata, Udu Nursing Station, Vunivutu Nursing Station, Tukavesi Health Centre and Vuna Nursing Station. In terms of the list of projects community engagement intervention sites are as follows: • • Central Division Nasoqo Village, Navunikabi Village, Laucala Village in Rewa, Uluiloli Village and Nayavu Village. Eastern Division Ravitaki Village, Talaulia Village, Tuvuca Village, Lomaloma Village and Lakeba Village. • Western Division Vakabuli Village, Kese Village, Nacula Village, Lomawai Village and Ekubu Village. • Northern Division Naqumu Village, Vunikodi Village, Sogobiyau Village, Kanakana Village and Kanacea Village. Secondly, the completion of the climate hazard vulnerability assessment for the 212 healthcare facilities under the Ministry are as follows: • Northern Division - 46 • - 52 Eastern Division • - 54 Central Division • Western Division - 60 Preliminary reports have pointed to many healthcare facilities around the country that require climate-proofing from the many years of neglect and the Ministry is working hard with the support of our partners to address this infrastructure improvements as it needs. The future, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is taking up the challenge to push ahead and address the issues relating to the impact of climate change on health. In our engagement in many virtual and face-to-face national, regional and global forums, we are raising our voice and continuing to advocate for multisectoral collaborations and partnerships to address climate change and health for Fiji and the Small Islands Developing States and include the: (1) National Climate Change and Health inter-ministerial stakeholder forums; (2) Regional Committee Meetings of the WHO Western Pacific Region; (3) World Health Assembly;</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2107 (4) Alliance for Transformative Action of Climate and Health (ATACH) – a global WHO-led support for the advance actions on climate change and health at country level. Fiji recently chaired the ATACH Working Group on Low Carbon Sustainable Health Systems. (5) Engagement as a Champion Country in the organisation of the first ever “Health Day” at the COP28 Forum in Dubai, UAE, in two weeks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, building infrastructure resilience, the Ministry is continuing its health infrastructure improvement through: (1) Effective and targeted partner engagement on infrastructure improvements such as the New Zealand Government support of FJ$2 million, World Bank support of US$250,000 towards selected health infrastructure support. (2) Decentralization of the Ministry’s Minor Works budget allocation of FJ$3 million to our health divisions to facilitate timely infrastructure works implementation. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are feeling the fallout from climate change, from giant tides to flash floods, to stronger cyclones and the impact on health is mounting. Addressing this requires our collective action at national, regional and global levels to protect our lives and livelihoods for now and generations to come. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services will continue to work with the Government’s Climate Change Division, stakeholders, and partners to strengthen our collective response for this important health threat. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his contribution, I would like, at this point, to adjourn Parliament so we can have morning tea. I hope you will enjoy the company of our guests in the gallery who are here with us and to share a bit more of our role. As you have all heard from the honourable Prime Minister and I would say that the delegation is quite lucky having to hear it from the horse’s mouth of all the bilateral and side meetings that he has attended and being invited by the President of the United States of America. We now adjourn for tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.43 a.m.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>2108</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 11.19 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we shall now continue and I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for their response. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Good morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to respond to the Ministerial Statement provided to us this morning by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change has become a fancy word locally, regionally and internationally. Climate change came out during Fiji’s Presidency to the COP and aligned to the SDGs and I hear the Ministers in their speeches using the words “climate change” in all their undertaking. So, it is out of Fiji’s Presidency to the Paris Agreement that we can create a milestone in the area of climate change. With regards to the honourable Minister’s Statement this morning Sir, climate change, he rightly mentioned comes in many shapes and forms. In fact, climate change posed significant challenges to the Fijian healthcare system including the relocation of facilities in vulnerable areas identified by the Ministry of Health due to sea level rise and landslide and flooding. This situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires attention from various aspects including funding and disaster resilience. Many of the identified facilities for relocation as alluded to by the honourable Minister this morning are primary healthcare facilities. Again, this poses a pressing concern as rising sea level can damage existing infrastructure. I thank the honourable Minister for identifying nursing stations and health centres that are affected by the climate change Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I hope that the honourable Minister will be given the critical support in restructuring new facilities and ensuring smooth transition of the healthcare services that are provided in the various stations in the affected communities. Securing funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for such endeavour is crucial for government and international agencies. The honourable Minister mentioned about KOICA support in the SHAPE Project for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. They play a pivotal role in providing financial resources to support the relocation of health facilities. It is essential to allocate adequate funds to cover not only the construction of new infrastructure, but also essential equipment, supplies and staffing required to maintain the uninterrupted healthcare services during and after the relocation. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster resilience must be a key consideration in designing and constructing new health facilities. Climate change increase the frequency and intensity, natural disasters like hurricanes, cyclones and storm surges, therefore these facilities should be built to withstand events ensuring the safety of patients, staff, critical medical equipment and also incorporating the features like reinforced structure at a level that will minimise the risks identified and also the robust emergency service system are essential components of disaster resilient health facility. I know that the previous government had adopted the new building code to build back better. In addition, physical infrastructure, capacity building is also important and the preparedness for healthcare who will be manning the stations. So, the training of healthcare professionals, emergency response team to handle climate health challenges and coordinating with the local communities and authority and developing response plans are vital to ensure the healthcare services can effectively adapt to changing environmental condition.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2109 In addressing the impact of climate change, there is a need for the relocation of health facilities, as mentioned. It encompasses good financial support, disaster resilient, capacity building, stakeholder collaboration, climate change mitigation in various sectors like transport, energy, housing and agriculture which are critical, to strengthen collaboration with health sector on addressing the impact of climate change on health. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important innovation in multi-sectoral policymaking is the shared practical lessons that are learnt and practised to strengthen action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and health system resilience. In recognising and investing in these key areas, then only we can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on the medical services and healthcare and ensure the wellbeing of our Fijian community are not affected with the rising sea level in Fiji and other vulnerable region. I urge the whole of Government, especially the Ministry of Finance, to look into the provision of funding to accommodate the proposed mitigations strategies as alluded to by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. Recent Developments in the iTaukei Land Trust Board HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public who are here at the gallery and those who are listening from home, ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, I rise to present the Ministerial Statement on the recent developments in the iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB) in 2023, a year marked by groundbreaking decisions and actions in favour of iTaukei landowning units and tenants. Mr. Speaker, the Board today has a vision for Fiji, where every iTaukei landowner thrives, where our youth’s future is financially secure and where our cultural heritage is firmly preserved. This vision is not just a dream, it is a future that the iTLTB is actively working towards. Currently, some iTaukei communities face uncertain land ownership, under-utilised economic potential and a need for empowering our youth and landowners. We seriously need transformative actions to turn the tide. Mr. Speaker, in response, we have implemented strategic measures to address these situations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTLTB has successfully processed and amended 101 Schedule A and B cases, securing land ownership for iTaukei communities of over 6,660 hectares. This strategic move not only safeguards our land, but also promises substantial annual lease revenue of $100,915. Mr. Speaker, our bold venture into overseas investment with Morgan’s Financial Limited represents a significant diversification of our portfolio, promising maximum returns and aligning with our custodian responsibilities. As a careful steward, iTLTB is committed to enhancing the financial assets of the landowning units. For this reason, we have chosen to pursue offshore investments as a strategic approach to fund growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have established a sinking fund to empower landowners in acquiring commercial properties, demonstrating our commitment to their financial independence and growth. The sinking fund is designed to assist landowning units in repurchasing leases when they expire, providing reliable financial support system for our landowning units to buy back those leases.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>2110</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Under this initiative, the iTLTB recently assisted Mataqali Etuba of Sigatoka to purchase an expired lease within the Sigatoka Town area. The property was acquired for $360,000, including a two-storey building in the heart of Sigatoka. Other ventures are being planned with landowning units in Ba, Nadi, Rakiraki, Nausori and Labasa, to become property owners within Central Business Districts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to save iTLTB from the annual rent of $1.3 million for its Offices throughout Fiji, the iTLTB has moved to acquire its own properties to house its regional offices. Any excess to the Board’s need, would be commercially rented out for extra income. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for increased visibility and improved accessibility to our services, iTLTB has initiated the opening up of our sub-regional offices. The first has been opened in Nabouwalu, with others being planned for Keiyasi, Taveuni and Vuda. This initiative will be of great help to numerous tenants around Fiji, who currently have to travel long distances to access our services. Further, the Board, while awaiting the establishment of sub-regional offices, has organised roadshows where customers are able to select their land on the spot and are given their offer letter on the same day. Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB, through its Board, has also approved the increase in title holder distribution to the traditional leaders, including: • • • Turaga i Taukei – 3 percent; Turaga ni Yavusa – 5 percent; and Turaga ni Mataqali – 7 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB has shifted the investment of minor’s funds from Home Finance Company (HFC) Bank to the Unit Trust of Fiji (UTOF), securing higher returns and ensuring a successful future for our youth. The allocation of 40 percent of these funds for educational and medical needs, while preserving a bigger amount of 60 percent for their adulthood. Empowering our youth through accessing their funds for crucial educational and medical needs is not just a policy, but an investment in our future. By allowing minors to use these resources, we are not only addressing their immediate needs but also laying the foundation for a healthier and a more educated generation - the foundation of our nation’s future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our effort to correct and amend lease boundaries for pine plantations, we have returned valuable overplanted land of 553 hectares to 74 landowning units in the Bua Province, enhancing their economic potential. This was in response to the longstanding appeal of landowning units for the return of overplanted pine land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our collaboration with stakeholders, such as Lion One Limited, has encouraged economic growth, job creation and big returns for landowners. This demonstrates our commitment to sustainable development. On 10 th October, 2023, we witnessed the first gold pour at the Tuvatu Gold Mine. The Gold Mine is not just a beacon of hope for our landowners and employees, but also a good source of revenue for our Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the crux of this progressive report may be predominantly landowner focussed, we have also devised a number of programmes of assistance for our tenants. This includes: • • • the staggering of premium payment due to financial difficulties faced by the tenant; opportunity to stagger arrears if facing economic hardship; and tenants are advised to take the opportunity to visit iTLTB Office for any assistance required.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2111 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the endorsement of open contracts for iTLTB staff marks a new era of job security and motivation, fostering a more efficient and productive workforce. Aligning with Government policy, we have raised the retirement age to 60 years, reflecting our commitment to our staff’s wellbeing and experience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, our increased engagement with landowners confirms our dedication to our core role. This engagement and dedication demands a robust human resource backbone. The iTLTB has undergone major human resources changes, positioning qualified and experienced personnel in key positions. The Board has also approved a 2 percent reduction in iTLTB operational cost to 8 percent, in view of the forecasted improved financial performance. These measures are not just steps but leaps towards a future where iTaukei land ownership and management will contribute significantly to our nation’s prosperity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, let us embrace this change, support our youth, secure our landowners’ future, improve our services to our tenants and propel Fiji towards a prosperous tomorrow. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement made by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs in relation to the recent developments done by the iTLTB this year, which I really commended iTLTB for, together with its trustees and interim CEO as well as the honourable Minister. Thank you, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB should always stick to its mandate under section 4 of the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940, which is to administer land for the benefit of the iTaukei landowners and that should remain intact. This includes utilisation of iTaukei land and also to assist landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister, for he has continued from where the previous Government has left off. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Vinaka:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- I really commend the honourable Minister for that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we have seen that now, iTLTB has moved ahead to purchase properties for the landowners which I am really delighted for. In the past, the previous Government has started off with land subdivisions for the iTaukei landowners. We have seen that in Wairabetia, Tavua, Vuda and lately, in Namata, Tailevu. In addition, the SEED Fund Grant where landowners have grown wealth from the resources that they own, I really thank the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, together with iTLTB. However, I wish to comment on the honourable Minister’s statement in regards to financial security of youth of to indigenous community or the iTaukei, particularly on the issue of equal lease distribution. I believe the removal of equal lease distribution made by the Government is so quick, it should have been treated cautiously by the honourable Minister, together with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, as well as the iTaukei Land Trust Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have seen that in the equal lease distribution, at least, some funds are reserved for those who have not reached 18 years. So, once they turn18, there is something for them. They can use it for their education or to buy what they want.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>2112</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 However, with the current projection that has been made by the honourable Minister, there is no clear indication as to how these funds will benefit the youth of indigenous community or iTaukei youth, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Lately, in my area, a Turaga ni Mataqali managed to purchase a car from his grandson’s savings once his grandson reached 18 years old. He went with his grandson and just purchased a car from his savings. Those are some of the issues I wish to bring to the attention of the honourable Minister, which I think the Ministry of the iTaukei Affairs as well as iTLTB should look into - the future of iTaukei youth in this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them! HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Listen honourable Members! (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge iTLTB, together with all the staff, to come up with innovative ideas. I really like this new funding initiative which is available now for landowners in terms of purchasing properties. However, the problem is that there is less capital resources for the landowners. They should go ahead purchase more tractors, diggers and bulldozers. We cannot take the knife and keep on cutting grasses in the village. (Laughter) Time has changed, Mr. Speaker. During their time we used cane knives. Now with our age coming up we need tractors. Now the cooperatives in Ra we thank the honourable Manoa Kamikamica for giving us a new tractor for our cooperative so that it goes with the time. MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the second tractor? HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, again I thank the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs for his Statement this morning. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Niudamu, thank you for acknowledging the second tractor. (Laughter) Appointment of the University Review Committee by the Higher Education Commission of Fiji HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, fellow honourable Members of Parliament and ladies and gentlemen: I warmly greet you all this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to brief this august House on the recent appointment of the five- member University Review Committee by the Higher Education Commission in Fiji on 5 th November, 2023. This independent intentional and comprehensive evaluation of universities is done to ensure that our Government commitment to world-class education is not only in words but also in</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2113 action. There are legislations that we are bound by, and it is through those legislations that this comprehensive review will be completed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of the Review Committee Members was based on consultation and recommendations of the Higher Education Commission of Fiji in line with the Higher Education Act 2008. The purpose of the University Review Committee is to assess and evaluate the overall performance, progress and quality of a university including its educational programmes, faculties, facilities and administrative processes. The Committee ensures that the university is meeting its educational objectives and maintaining academic standards and it may also make recommendations for improvements and changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is well-documented that a university review should take place regularly to ensure that the institution remains aligned with its goals and objectives. The frequency of these reviews will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the university and are often conducted every few years or on a cyclical basis. In Fiji this review has lapsed due to COVID-19 that impacted the university review in several ways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic has led to widespread disruptions in higher education including shifts to online learning, changes in enrolment patterns and financial challenges. Part of this review will also need to consider evaluating the university’s response to the pandemic and its ability to adapt to the changing circumstances. The terms of engagements of the Committee I have been advised by the Board Chairperson that the review will be completed six months after their appointment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Higher Education Commission of Fiji is mandated under Section 7 of the Higher Education Act, 2008 to register, review and renew the registration of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) including the three universities offering post-secondary qualifications and training in Fiji. Under Section 9 of the Act and Section 36 to 45 of the Higher Education Regulation 2009, and institutions registered with the Commission shall be reviewed for quality assurance periodically. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Review Committee was established in accordance with the following provisions of the Higher Education Act 2008 and Regulations 2009. “The Commission under Section 8 of the Higher Education Act can establish Committees consisting of its Members and other people it considers appropriate to assist it in the performance of its functions and under Section 12(4) of the Act the Commission may occasionally appoint such other officers, employees, consultants, agents or other personnel as it thinks fit for effective performance of its functions.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the position of the Ministry of Education and the Higher Education Commission of Fiji that any review of the Higher Education Institutions cannot be done in isolation of the industry and consumers. Industry and consumers are core stakeholders and beneficiaries of Fiji’s Higher Education Sector. In other words, consumer and industry perspectives on the experiences of how they have benefitted and we would like to see the future of Higher Education Institutions in light of the dynamically changing labour market and consumer expectations. The latter is imperative because Fiji aims to develop its TVET sector. Consumers have had a negative perception that TVET is not an area of consideration for children. This review therefore aims to hear from parents, guardians, teachers and stakeholders and ensure that we have a clear awareness programme that create industry-demanded pathways for graduates of the TVET programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, historically it is viewed that Higher Education Reviews have become academic-oriented or academic-focussed with committees dominated by academics. In such</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>2114</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 committees there is little or limited weight given to industry and consumer perspectives and expectations and such reviews are abstract from reality and practice. Higher Education Institutions need to produce graduates that meet consumer and industry needs, enhance consumer and industry welfare and impact public policies in more than one way. For these reasons, Fiji’s Education Review Committee is different and departs from ancient thinking. The Committee is broad ranging: it has only two academics, it consists of civil society representatives and experts that not only represent industry, but it also captures consumer perspectives. The Committee’s composition is fair and therefore, innovative and unique and sets a new approach to reviewing institutions. Equally importantly, the Terms of Refence allows the Committee to consider and appoint technical subject advisors to assist in reviewing and assessing programme materials and learning resources. It is envisaged that the Committee will use its power intentionally to promote the quality of its works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just briefly allow me to introduce the Committee Members: (1) Committee Chairperson: Professor Simon Wilkie, Monash University Mr. Wilkie’s career spans a remarkable array of roles extending beyond the Higher Education sphere including appointments as Chief Economic Policy Strategist at Microsoft Corporation and Chief Economist with the US Federal Communications Commission.

(6) Member: Mr. Rex Stephen Horoi Mr. Horoi is a former Diplomat who served as a Solomon Islands Permanent Representative to the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 1992-2000 before returning to the South Pacific to head one of the largest Civil Society Organisations in the Pacific Region, the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific International (FSPI). Mr. Rex Horoi has maintained an interest in higher education since serving as the Director of the Solomon Islands College for Higher Education (SICHE) before his diplomatic appointment to the United Nations. He upholds and promotes the implementation of critical thinking, ethical leadership and practical entrepreneurship to be embedded in our education ecosystem. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the criteria for review process that was given to the Committee include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) evaluation of the institution’s vision and mission; scrutiny of the Annual Reports to understand institutional challenges, progress and milestones achieved; review of the structure and content of the Study Programmes and teaching and assessment strategies; assessment of the available facilities for staff and students to ensure a conducive learning and teaching environment; investigation into the institution’s quality assurance and quality control. review of practical attachments or internships offering students real-world experience. evaluation of staff qualifications, staff competencies, and other staffing matters. Review admission requirements to ensure fairness, transparency and alignment with the institution’s academic goals. assessment of the status of research work, scrutiny of internal review and evaluation procedures to ensure continuous improvement and self-assessment. examining fees, charges and other financial obligations to students. They may also have to consider any other matters that may be relevant for the assessment and impact the institution’s quality standards. Mr. Speaker Sir, the methodology of the review will include:</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>2116</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 (1) Data collection and assessment of the current status; (2) Consideration of self-assessment by institutions; (3) Compilation of desk review; (4) University visits and engagements; (5) Stakeholder consultations; and (6) Compilation final report with necessary recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have outlined clearly to this august Parliament, the appointment process, the purpose and the intention of the University Review Committee I wish to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of Education will continue to engage with our universities and our regulator (the Higher Education Commission of Fiji) to ensure that we build our capability to world class standards. I believe this review exercise, the critical legal requirement that will enhance our strengths as well as one of learnings of areas that we need to work more collaboratively in and this review process is part of the commitment to ensuring that we remain relevant and competitive. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, I wish to extend our deepest appreciation to the members for agreeing to be part of this process and we look forward to receiving a comprehensive report when the review is completed in six months’ time and we anticipate the cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders in this process. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate.</p><h4>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the Ministerial Statement</h4><p>delivered by the honourable Minister for Education and I thank him for his Statement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, external reviews are good intentions for tertiary education in nation building, however, fundamentals need to be corrected first otherwise it is the same as building a roof without the foundation. The roof will continue to collapse, the fundamentals or imperatives that I want to talk about is Higher Education Commission Fiji and the composition of expertise of the review committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Higher Education Commission Fiji is to be partly responsible for the issue that we are faced with today. They regulate quality and relevance in the country. I want to ask the honourable Minister to first review the effectiveness and performance of Higher Education Commission Fiji and see they are operating within their mandate. At this point in time, I want to draw attention on the requirements to be a Commission Chair at Higher Education Commission Fiji. The Act is very clear that one should have post graduate qualifications and tertiary education experience. Does the current Chair meet the requirements? Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need someone as chair of Higher Education Commission Fiji with good qualification and vast tertiary education experience because the Commission has fundamental responsibilities which include establish national standards for different qualifications, oversee the review process of higher education institutions, provides assurance that the programme developed by the institutions meet national standards, foster cooperation amongst higher education institutions and linkages between Higher Education Institutions and Industry, maintain a database of higher education information. So honourable Minister Sir, your intention to carry out external review of the three universities is good for the country, but please fix Higher Education Commission Fiji first which is an imperative to review three universities.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2117 I also feel that the Higher Education Commission Fiji should align the progression of students from secondary schools to the universities. This week, I saw a handing over of a report of the scholarship and a way forward plan for three to five years by Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Service (TSLS). Out of interest, I googled and found the report. The report is done by an international expert. The report is crystal clear that quality and relevance is the big issue in the programmes offered by the three Universities. The employment market information is showing that the programmes offered by the universities are not relevant or are outdated and do not match the unfolding and emerging skillsets required in the country. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What else? HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my concern on the composition of the Committee to review universities namely; the University of Fiji, Fiji National University and University of the South Pacific. The academic members come from only Australian University, Monash and who are both members of the same school of this institution. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- There are many other renowned universities in Australia..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Which one? HON. H. CHAND.- …which are highly ranked. Why are both members of the Committee from the same university? How was the Committee chosen? How will they assess the broad range of discipline and programmes offered by the three universities? It is a matter of concern. Moreover, Monash and Fiji National University are tied up in a project. Here is a clear case of conflict of interest and inherent bias in the choice of Monash University staff to carry out a supposedly independent external review. The members on the Review Committee lack university governance experience, quality assurance knowledge and experience. I have also noted from the honourable Minister’s presentation that no one has been a Vice Chancellor, Deputy Chancellor or Pro Vice-Chancellor and the Committee also lacks expertise in the labour market. Honourable Minister, my suggestion is to have a serious review of Fiji Higher Education Commission and relook at the composition of the Review Committee. Establishment of Fiji’s National Anti-Doping Organisations HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Members of Cabinet, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; thank you for the opportunity to make my Ministerial Statement. Before that, I wish to take this opportunity to wish Team Fiji well as they participate in the 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara. I also wish to thank Fiji’s Honorary Consul in the Solomons, all our Fijian population living in Honiara and the Fiji Military Forces for supporting Team Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- I thought you were in the Solomon Islands.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- He just flew in this morning:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to address this noble Parliament by providing an updated report on the establishment of Fiji’s National Anti-Doping Organisation</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>2118</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 (NADO). The main objective of NADO is the proper implementation and compliance of the world anti-doping agency code on creating a more accountable framework which will provide strategic direction, guide and monitor clean sports and sports development in Fiji. The NADO will ensure that the rights of clean athletes is protected and that clean sports is promoted and practiced at all times. Doping undermines the fundamental values of sports such as health, fairness, commitment, integrity and equal opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given our geographical size, the sudden influx of illegal substances in Fiji has increased. It is only a matter of time that athletes will resort to using illegal substances to enhance their performance in their respective sports. Doping is deceptive and harmful to athletes as it diminishes the sanctity of clean sports and undermines the rights of clean athletes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget allocation for Youth and Sports Development provides the necessary resources to establish the NADO and progressively as part of the Ministry’s strategic plan to equip us with the infrastructure, personnel and testing facilities required to effectively carry out its mandate. The NADO is a new initiative and is independent to an extent of its operations. A budget of FJ$386,700 was approved from the 2023-2024 Budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are currently finalising the recruitment for a coordinator to: coordinate and assist the establishment of the NADO; (1) (2) develop, implement and update anti-doping policies and procedures in accordance with international standards and regulations; and (3) develop and deliver educational programmes to athletes, coaches and support staff regarding the consequences of doping, the importance of clean sports and the anti-doping rules. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the NADO Working Committee has engaged an expert consultant who has already assisted in the completion of the outstanding 17 corrective actions by the World Anti-Doping Agency. These corrective actions are critical in ensuring Fiji’s participation at international sanctioned tournaments such as the Rugby 15s World Cup that just recently concluded. With the completion of the corrective actions, the World Anti-Doping Agency has given us until mid-2024 to successfully formalise the establishment of the National Anti-Doping Organisation and NADO Bill and the Ministry is working closely with Drugs Free Sports Fiji to facilitate this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important aspect of this exercise is the development of the NADO legislation. This is currently under review with the Office of the Solicitor-General and the World Anti-Doping Agency hence after the legislation has been finalised by the Office of the Solicitor- General, a public consultation will be conducted prior to Cabinet approval. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an unprecedented development, not only for Fiji but for the Pacific with the central and specialised organisations to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies in Fiji. The rights of clean athletes will be protected, and clean and fair sports will be effectively promoted and practiced. With Fiji taking the lead in sports development in the Pacific, establishing NADO will enhance our position and reach to the Pacific region. Fundamentally it will protect the right of athletes to participate in doping free sports and thus promote health, fairness and equality for our athletes.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2119 Before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to pay tribute to the late Mr. Sitiveni Moceidreke. Mr. Moceidreke participated in the 100 yards and 200 yards in the 1960 Rome Olympics. In 1962, he also participated in the Seventh Commonwealth Games. Mr. Moceidreke is from Viseisei, Vuda, and we take this time to honour him for his contribution to sports in Fiji. We wish the family all the very best, for a life so important to Fiji in the name of sports. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have labelled our response to the honourable Minister’s Ministerial Statement as titled "Clean Athletes, Clean Sports for a Safe and Peaceful Community”. In 2010, Fiji became the 150 th nation to ratify the UN Treaty against the practice of doping in sports. Since then, much has progressed and has been done by the previous government. So, I am so thankful to the Government and the honourable Minister’s update and statement today to complete the exercise. Our Olympics stature, Sir, in the Olympics we have gained two Gold and one Bronze through clean athletes and clean sports. In our response this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have extracted three important thoughts: (1) Sports as a nation builder; (2) Sports as an industry; and (3) Sports as a foreign policy tool. So, the establishment of this National Anti- Doping Organisation for Fiji is timely indeed. Sports as a nation builder, the next or the future generation, if they are well and clean, we have a degree of certainty for our future. When I say clean, they are healthy, they are not into all sorts of other things to keep them clean. Sports as an industry, this can become as we have witnessed as a major export commodity. We have witnessed that through remittances and we continue to see that in the future if we are able to direct the right energy and resources in ensuring that our commodity in this particular case, our athletes are clean. There will be a greater demand for much more Semis and so forth, to name one in this particular industry in sports. Sports as a foreign policy tool, there is huge potential in sports as many other countries have used to use sports as the basis of establishing, promoting and sustaining good relationship. We have a huge potential in this particular area, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for peaceful relations which we have heard the honourable Prime Minister talking about a peaceful zone, the Pacific region which is peaceful Fiji can contribute to this in a major way through clean athletes and clean sports. As we sit this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we heard from the honourable Minister conveying, we also would like to convey our best wishes and congratulations to team Fiji in Solomon Islands, especially those that have progressed into team sports, semi-final status, those that have one medals and for me, in particular, as the president of Basketball Fiji both the men and women’s teams are playing well. I am sure the men are now in the semi-final status. We look forward for a successful outcome of their games. MR. SPEAKER.- Congratulations to the team.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>2120</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Dairy Industry in Fiji HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise this morning to speak on the Dairy Industry in Fiji and the support that Government offers to the Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited. Before I move into the statement proper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to some of the issues raised by my colleague, honourable Sachida Nand, yesterday regarding subsidies. Subsidies are also offered for non-sugarcane crops like rice, cassava and dalo and also for ginger for the purchase of fertilizers and chemicals. We are looking to extend that to other commodities in the next budget. Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I talked about beef cattle, but today it is about dairy. It is still the cattle business anyway. The dairy industry in Fiji is one of the critical agro-based industries that supports a significant number of farmers and farming families in the production of milk on a small and large scale. Government has a vision for a dairy sector that not only meets the nation’s milk demands, but also as a future strong player in Fiji’s socio-economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward, we plan to increase milk production, reduce the milk import bill and expand the export base for milk and dairy products. Let me say that there is a huge potential for investment in the dairy sector as we rely heavily on imports to meet our domestic demand. In 2022, Fiji’s milk production was around 12 million litres. While we imported around 7.2 million litres with a total national demand at around 22 million litres of milk. Mr. Speaker Sir, as I have already alluded to, our vision is for the industry to expand beyond the borders of Fiji, with a commitment to position Fiji-made dairy products internationally beginning with our neighbouring Pacific Island Countries. Export opportunities include a diverse range of dairy products that focuses on value addition to meet the demands of consumers Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has its core role to support the dairy industry. To that end, the Ministry has allocated funds through a grant of $5 million to the Fiji Co-operative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL) for that very purpose - to improve the supply and quality of milk from our farmers. This grant support to FCDCL, apart from other interventions, is meant to address the fundamental issues facing the industry. The Ministry is committed to assist farmers through the provision of support services in collaboration with FCDCL on areas such as capacity building, infrastructure development, breed improvement, nutrition improvement, price incentive, feed subsidy, farm development, milk cartage and provision of veterinary and extension services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of Parliament, the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture will elaborate on the Breed Improvement Programme for the dairy industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $2 million has been released by the Ministry for the following activities by FCDCL: Operation and support for stock import; • • Milk price top-up per litre to sustain costs; • • • • • • Cartage of milk from farm gate; Pasture establishment; Top 40 supplier subsidy on milking machine; Semi intensive machinery purchase incentive and water reticulators; Recruitment of Dairy Advisory Officers; and Hire of a registered Veterinary Officer.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2121 Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCDCL bears the cost that is incurred in the milk collection process that directly benefits the smallholder farmers. This grant which pays for the collection costs allows milk cartage contractors to collect and cart raw milk to the chilling centres. Currently, a total of 230 farmers are assisted with this provision, and so are new farmers who are willing to supply milk to the chilling centre. Mr. Speaker, Sir, livestock feed, such as soya bean meal and mill-mix is subsidised where farmers pay one-third, and the grant contributes two-third of the cost. This subsidy is based on the farmers’ milk production, considering the number of milking cows and calves. A total of 368 farmers will be assisted - 240 from the Central Division and 128 from the Western Division. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recruitment of the four Dairy Advisory Officers in the Central Division will further strengthen the extension advisory services to the dairy farmers. Their role includes assisting and advising farmers on good husbandry and management practices, such as calf rearing, feeding, breeding, recording and offering training for dairy farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Veterinary Officer based at FCDCL will ensure that veterinary services are provided to the industry stakeholders in a timely manner. The Veterinary Officer will also be able to guide the Daily Advisory Officers in performing minor surgeries and administering veterinary medicine. This position will also ensure smooth collaboration with other agencies, in particular, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji and the Ministry of Agriculture on the importation of dairy cattle. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nutrition assistance will provide packages for farmers to invest in pasture establishment. The package will assist in land preparation, provision of fertilizer at a cost sharing basis and a total of 50 hectares of improved pasture is to be established under this activity. Better quality pasture would mean better quality milk and increased milk production. As Minister for Agriculture, I am also advocating the mass planting of juncao grass on a large scale for use as feed for livestock, especially in the intensive rearing, as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister in his earlier speech. Mr. Speaker, Sir, juncao grass is high in crude protein value and can be stored as fodder for a variety of livestock. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for price incentive, all farmers will be paid 18 cents per litre top-up on their current production, effective from 1 st August, 2023 on a weekly basis. In the past 10 years, farmers were paid below their cost of production. Thus, the industry was not able to recover. The 18 cents top-up will lead to sustainable income for farmers, which will enable them to reinvest into their farms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers will also be assisted with some incentive and water reticulation packages to increase and also improve quality of milk. Farmers will be assisted with line and portable milking machines, to reduce labour cost from hand-milking, and water supply materials for maintaining hygiene and quality of milk. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture will continue to support the dairy industry through FCDCL and work closely with the industry stakeholders, such that the industry benefits all dairy farmers and the Fijian economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for providing me the opportunity to deliver this Statement. Vinaka vakalevu, thank you and dhanyavad. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch. When we return, the honourable Leader of the Opposition or probably the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture will be elaborating more on the breeding aspect of dairy cows. Yesterday, was to do</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>2122</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 with beef, today is dairy - we are using the same bulls, I think.

SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we shall continue. Is the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture going to make another statement?</p><h4>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, I request to present it on Friday.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of Opposition or his designate to deliver the response. HON. S. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, before I contribute to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister, I would like to pay tribute to the late Chief Justice – Justice Kamal Kumar, who passed away in Suva yesterday. Justice Kumar served the Judiciary, the nation and the people well and his contribution to the society is well noted. Our condolences to his grieving family. May God grant him eternal peace and may his soul rest in peace. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the dairy sector, like the honourable Minister has said, holistic approach to the improvement of dairy is needed, and I am glad that this year, the Ministry has done a holistic approach. They have contributed to animal health, animal feed, farm management, et cetera. I was taken aback at the honourable Minister’s production figures. He mentioned that in 2022, they produced 12 million litres of milk. In Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL), I know the production figure. Somehow, I think there was an error in their figure. I think they said they produced 6.07 million litres. In 2023, they are expecting 5.39 million litres; in 2024, they are expecting 5.99 million litres (according to their draft Business Plan); and in 2025, they are expecting 7.05 million litres. So, 12 million litres is way above the target. I do not think the production is 12 million litres. Leaving that aside, this assistance in the dairy sector cannot be here for a year and then left - it has to be continuous. There may be a selection of farms, you assist for one year and monitor it for another two to three years. The monitoring and evaluation of farms is missing. Extension Officers or Dairy Advisory Officers which the honourable Minister has spoken about, need to be on the farm. They need to monitor all these assistance. It is Government and taxpayers’ money that is going to the dairy industry, so it has to be monitored. I know many farms where the barbed wire and fencing posts have been given to them but are still lying on the farm and has not been used. So, the taxpayers’ money has to be well utilised. Also, it has to be a controlled assistance so that assistance had to be given in phases. They complete one phase, then the other assistance should be released. When assistance is given to the farmers, I would request the Ministry that the full assistance reaches the farmer. Part of it should not be taken as administration expense or a markup by the person delivering that assistance to the farmers. So, if feed is bought at $5 or $6 a bag at Flour Mills using Government funds, it should reach the farmer at $5 or $6 a bag, not at $8 or $9 a bag, making of margin in between. The assistance is directed to the farmers and the farmers should receive it. The FCDCL which the honourable Minister has talked about, is a small organisation and according to their draft Business Plan, their salaries and wages budget is $450,000. It is quite big for a small organisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, uniforms, for example, is $9,000, so on an average it amounts to $400 to $450 per person. I do not think they are buying blazers, ties and everything, so it is quite exorbitant. That needs to be controlled. This money should be directed to the farmers so that they</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>2124</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 can increase production, not used exorbitantly as administration expense. I hope that the $5 million which the Government has allocated, every cent of that $5 million reaches the farmer and the dairy farmer benefits because they need the assistance. They need Government support, and they are willing to increase production, provided we assist them. I, again, thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture for allocating that $5 million in his Ministry to the dairy industry, and I hope to see the dairy industry grow.</p></body>
