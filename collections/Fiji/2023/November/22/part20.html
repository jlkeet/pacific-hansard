<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF YOUTH AND SPORTS2019-2020 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF YOUTH AND SPORTS 2019-2020 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Ministry of Youth and Sports 2019 to 2020 Annual Report which was tabled on 11 th September, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s core responsibilities are focussed on facilitating Youth and Sports Development through the establishment of a conducive policy environment that provides strategic support systems, initiatives for personal development and character building, sports policy implementation and community based youth-led programmes. There are two core programmes coordinated and facilitated by the Ministry of Youth and Sports: (1) Youth Development - this programme centres on the provision of assistance to youths through advisory empowerment and capacity building including specific skills training. (2) Sports Development - the programme focuses on the development of sports and its infrastructure nationwide through the provision of grants to the Fiji National Sports Commission, the National Sporting Organisations and Fiji Sports Council as well as the provision of basic sports equipment and the development of rural playing field. Mr. Speaker, the financial year of 2019/2020 was the beginning of an extremely challenging era and the Ministry’s rapid response plan in the wake of the global pandemic through the announcement and implementation of the youth farm initiative programme. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry continued with its programmes under the Youth Empowerment Programme and simultaneously carried out the implementation of the Civil Service Reforms. The Ministry continued conducting accredited training at its five youth training centres, mobile skills training continued to be rolled out across the four Divisions and there was a notable increase in the number of youth attending these trainings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the development of sports is ongoing with the Ministry through close collaboration with Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC). In raising our sporting standards, experts were brought in to enhance the participation of youth in local and international sports. In addition, the Ministry also conducts programmes through its own initiative targeting youth groups. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years the Ministry continued to uphold an all-inclusive approach towards sports development in the country and ensure that all Fijians receive equal access to sports and sporting facilities regardless of gender, background or ability. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and before I offer the floor, I also have a list before me provided by the Whips. The first speaker from the Opposition will be honourable Viam Pillay, then we will alternate to the honourable Minister for Youth before honourable Ketan Lal and then it is honourable Assistant Minister for Women to round it off.</p><div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 2177 Finally, you are speaking honourable Ketan Lal as I have got your name on the list here.</p><h4>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Sir only for five minutes.</h4><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- Five minutes is too little for you?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Okay, because you love heckling from the back there. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my remarks on the findings of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs which conducted its review of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Annual Report 2019 – 2010. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were few Committee findings that the Committee compiled during the deliberation. These were students dropping out of training centres due to financial constraints, peer pressure, home sickness and disciplinary issues. To enable a 100 percent graduation of students, the Ministry worked on including a parent’s day at Youth Training Centres. The Ministry also in adopting a collaborative approach with the NGO to address peer pressure while providing guidance to youths through training and continuous monitoring from respective divisions which is ongoing. The Ministry is also having partnerships with its stakeholders, for example, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the iTaukei Affairs Board for the respective provincial councils to support development, iTaukei youths inclusion of programmes such as leadership training by having guest speakers at Youth Training Centres to provide guidance and inspire youths to become successful through the programmes offered and permitting a second chance to the school dropouts for course completion in the future. Apart from the courses offered in different Youth Training Centres, there is a need for the Ministry to diversify the courses offered online with current market demands. As such, the Ministry is continuing to innovate and explore opportunities with the stakeholders to diversify the courses offered at the current facilities and to work with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), faith-based organisations and other stakeholders in addressing student dropouts and increase the number of graduates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Review, the Committee highlighted various areas that needs to be strengthened by the Ministry and relevant recommendations formulated for resolution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years the Ministry had continued to uphold an all-inclusive approach towards sports development in the country and ensure that all Fijians receive equal access to sports and sporting facilities regardless of gender, background or ability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I support the motion. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the core roles of the Ministry of Youth and Sports is, there are two core roles, one is on Youth Development and second on Sports Development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Youth and Sports aims to accelerate sports development in Fiji by encouraging the promotion of sporting activities through effective networking relationships with communities, voluntary groups, local authorities and national governing bodies such as the Fiji National Sports Commission, the Fiji Sports Council and Boxing Commission of Fiji. For the past six years, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has been allocated a budget of around $95.2 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2023-2024 Financial year the Ministry has been allocated a total</p><div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div><p>2178 Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 budget of $19.5 million to further expand and enhance sports development programmes whilst simultaneously ensuring that adequate investment is being made into the upgrade of sporting infrastructure around the nation Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Youth and Sports also continues to ensure that our youths, the future leaders of tomorrow are empowered and that necessary capacity building trainings are made available to allow them to improve the individual livelihoods. The Ministry of Youth and Sports continues to ensure that youths in various communities around the nation have accessed conducive sporting facilities and necessary sporting equipment made possible through partnerships with local clubs and schools. Additionally, the Ministry prioritises the development and training of Fijian youth through youth capacity building and training programme that develop youths life skills for their personal, mental and spiritual development. The Ministry has five Youth Training Centres around the country namely Nasau in Sigatoka, Yavitu in Kadavu, Naleba in Macuata, Naqere in Savusavu and Valelevu in Suva. The various trainings that are covered under this programme include the following Mobile Skills Training, Youth Coast Care Club, Empowerment Training, Youth Group Registrations, Youth Outreach and Monitoring Youth Entrepreneurship and the Youth Volunteers. These training programmes provide a learning environment for young people that may extend beyond boundaries or classrooms and incorporate the wealth of knowledge and experiences from the experienced trainers. All training offered at the Youth Training Centres by the Ministry are free of charge and it gives a second chance for our children who have dropped out from formal education. The Ministry is working very closely with the Fiji National University to deliver specialise courses for our youth around the country that will prepare them for employment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about the impact of sports development, sporting infrastructure with assistance of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the following are identified as impacts on the ground: (1) Increase in physical activity and sports participation. The smartest way to tackle NCDs and other health issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to invest in sports infrastructure, sports facilities. (2) The accessibility of sporting facility is the best way to address activities among youths in red zone areas in our urban centres is to invest in sports facilities as well. When we engage our youths to sports activities, they are able to come out from other activities. The creation of Sports Associations in communities. Sports Development Programme has also assisted the establishment of Community Sports Association and that has been noted to be established around the country. The other point that I wish to highlight here is on the impact of sports on the ground and that it has created income-generation and the marketability of our sports people. When we invest in sports, we are investing in sporting facilities, and it not only provides income-generating opportunities, but creates a pathway for our sports people to excel, to be marketable and gain employment. Some of them got their contracts overseas and are now playing overseas because of sports. The last item I want to highlight in my presentation: Mr. Speaker, Sir, additionally the Ministry continues to acknowledge the contributions made by elite sports personnel within the field</p><div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 2179 of sports, and the need to establish the National Academy. I think it is something that had been pointed by the reports. The need to establish the National Academy of sports is something that I wish to highlight in my presentation this evening. The Cabinet papers for the establishment of the National Sports Academy, were prepared and presented to Cabinet through the Ministry of Youth and Sports in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Regrettably, Cabinet’s approval was not received. But I wish to reassure Parliament again today that the Ministry of Youth and Sports, in line with its 5-year Strategic Plan, is working towards the establishment of the National Academy of Sports. I would like to thank the Committee for their Report, and I support the motion before Parliament. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know it is quite late, I will try to be as quick as possible and finish within the five minutes. I rise to contribute to the report that is before us, and I thank the Committee Members and the specific Ministry for their support in getting this report to Parliament. I note one of the important recommendations that has come to this Parliament, and that is to continue and build on youth grant initiatives that will elevate and strengthen youth development in Fiji. I also note that in 2019 and 2020 no new sports ground were developed and that is because of COVID-19 and lots of restrictions. Also, majority of our sports construction materials do come from overseas, and they are of different quality, and they are not made in Fiji. But, as always, when I speak, I do get something up here. It is important for us to focus on finding various avenues to strengthen our youth community. Our youth community is the future of Fiji, and I wished the honourable Professor Prasad would be present here but, unfortunately, he left. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we fast track to 2023, our young people are worried about how the Coalition Government will strengthen the youth development, because this Government is already making ill-advised decisions. One of them is the regular constitutional breaches, and this is in relation to the recommendation. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member you should be speaking on the content of the report. HON. K. K. LAL.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is on strengthening youth development. We need to find avenues and the youth are worried that the Government’s decision so far has not allowed them to have confidence in having the …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Potholes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.- Not potholes but there are many other things. Youths are worried about the recent reshuffle by the Government:</span> The recent vote at the UN, the recent decision on Japan’s Nuclear Waste Released and just today we highlighted an important issue about a social media app. which was used to share nude photos of girls. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about the Ministry of Youth. It is our Ministry, it is for the youth. They are there for the youths. It is the Ministry’s responsibilities to look after our needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to make sure that their policies must be youth- focussed because youths are the future of Fiji. If the Government’s policies are not youth-focussed the youth will not have any confidence in the Government. I urge the honourable Minister for</p><div><a name="92">Page 92</a></div><p>2180 Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 Youth and Sports to continue the collaborations you have with youth organisations. You can also come to us. We can also give you some advice. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said that there is a lot of ill-advised decisions by the Government, just like the reshuffle. We hope that there was no reshuffle but unfortunately the new Attorney-General, I am sorry the Attorney-General is still here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted before that our youths are the most important citizens of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- You have said that three times. HON. K. K. LAL.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. Sir, since you have picked up what I have said three times I hope the Government picked it up because they have called us a lot of names. Just a while ago I think, honourable Prasad called us looters. Unfortunately, we are youth MPs here as well. We are not looters. We are here representing the people and the youths as well. With those words, I commend this Report to Parliament and I hope this Government will continue to work towards or for the youths, Sir. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of Opposition, Ministers, Assistant Minister and Members of Parliament: Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to share some thoughts since the honourable Minister has covered a lot on what sports is doing for our youths. Let me respond to the last Member who has talked about youths development. The current Coalition Government is extremely concerned about youths and has done a lot within the last few months. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Tell them! HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, the National Youth Policy was not updated since 2014 and the Ministry had stopped working with the National Youth Council. Under the current Government this year the National Youth Council has been recognised. There is an AGM planned later this year. HON. P. K. BALA.- When?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.- The National Youth Policy has been approved by the Cabinet:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.:</span> Why Cabinet? Why not youths? HON. S. KIRAN.- For the National Youth Policy to be adopted it has to go through Cabinet. Maybe, you, I am not aware of that. Youth can be very wide age range and needs a vision to ensure youth development programmes are relevant. I personally have been very inspired by the vision of the current Youth Minister who has taken the time to listen to the National Youth Council that the Ministry had previously stopped working with. The honourable Minister also took his time to spend time with and listen to street kids living</p><div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 2181 in a vacant house in Lautoka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, listening to a wide range of voices, the Ministry and the honourable Minister has evolved a wide range of programmes for youth. This year we saw the Ministry of Youth evolve youth fields in three districts encouraging unemployed youths to come and engage and learn. The Ministry of iTaukei worked with the Ministry of Youth to try and encourage unemployed youths to attend the fair. Training institutes and employers had booths and enrolled youths in employment and training courses, a batch of street kids also joined the fair. A hotel chain was able to get 130 CVs in the West from this youth fair, a construction company in Suva and another hotel in Suva said that they were able to recruit 30 youths each through this employment fair.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Vinaka:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.:</span> Having engaged with private sector the Ministry has developed programmes relevant to the market, has created the database and employment pathways. Ministries have open its doors for unemployed youths including street kids to its programmes and training institutions. While the Ministry works on youth development through sports and music the current Minister has ensured youth engagement in development programmes including operationalising Kadavu Vocational Training Centre as a shared partnering with Fiji National University to offer 14 market relevant courses. So I wish to commend the Ministry’s work under the visionary leadership of honourable Jese Saukuru that have engaged in a wide range of partnerships to ensure relevant programmes for all youth in Fiji. I wish to say thank you to the Committee for the report and I wish to support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the honourable Members that contributed to the motion before the House and I would like to also wish the honourable Minister a very best in taking on board the Committee recommendations and hope that the honourable Minister will take the Ministry to greater heights in future. With that being said Sir, I have no further comments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
