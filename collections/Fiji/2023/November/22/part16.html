PRASAD.:</span> Obviously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have never seen the Opposition confused. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Areh , only you’re confused.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The current Opposition which was back then the Government and Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, they cannot even up to this point further the fact that they are sitting in the</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>2154 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023 Opposition. I think it will take them four years to learn the Opposition role and maybe another four years before they become the real Opposition. The then honourable Leader of the Opposition now Leader of the Opposition then Minister, honourable Faiyaz Koya, honourable Parveen Bala honourable Viam Pillay, honourable Mosese Bulitavu, honourable Semi Koroilavesau, honourable Alvick Maharaj and, of course, honourable Jone Usamate. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Why you say my name? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth recalling what honourable Jone Usamate said on the day in support of the recommendations of the Emoluments Committee and I quote: “Ideally in an ideal world we would get an independent party to come but in this particular instance the Emoluments Committee has decided that it will not look at the remuneration but it must take into consideration those aspects of allowances that have an impact on the livelihood of how well the Parliamentarians themselves can carry out their roles”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what we are looking at today. This is what he said, and I quote: “The Emoluments Committee and his suggestions is probably something people will not like it politically because it has an impact on how people reflect on Members of the House but it is something that needs to be done because it has an impact on the ability of Parliamentarians to fully engage themselves in the process to which they are called in this House.” Mr. Speaker, the voting record of the day for the motion on a so-called Emoluments Report of four Members of Parliament will prove that there were two votes against the increase. And I can say very proudly honourable Prem Singh and I actually voted against the increases. Our position back then now and now that we are in Government remains the same. It is unethical and worst of all Members of Parliament to determine our own salaries and that is why, Mr. Speaker, this Emoluments Committee that this Parliament has appointed is engaging independent experts to do that. And you rightly, Mr. Speaker, have allowed the Committee more time to come with the Report done fairly, transparently and in accountable manner.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am sure we all agree that the means for achieving the end is also important. Mr:</span> Speaker, allow me to compare the new proposed rate of Overseas Travel Allowances and the honourable Prime Minister has done that but let me just repeat some of those. This is in respect of the honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Leader of the Opposition and Members of Parliament. Let us use the amount of US$300 per day and a conversion rate of $2.20 from US dollar to Fiji dollar. Purely as an example of an UNDP rate which is the accepted standard for allowances. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will demonstrate that the reduction is not a cosmetic exercise but then the Peoples Coalition Government is more than walking its talk of reducing salaries and allowances by 25</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2155 percent. It is actually much more than this. Under the current provisions of the Remunerations Act the Prime Minister will receive a daily overseas travel allowance of $2,910 under the new reduced rate. The allowance will be $1,320 per day. This is a big reduction, Mr. Speaker, of $1,590. Even if you double the reduced allowance of $1,320 it does not reach what would be paid under the current provision which is $2,910 per day. Therefore, it is the reduction of not 25 percent but well over 100 percent and this is substantial. That is why the 250 percent loading on US dollars is being revoked and replaced with 100 percent. The $600 a day as Incidental Allowance is being removed altogether. In the case of Cabinet Ministers, Mr. Speaker, there is a similar scenario and again the reduction is more than 100 percent. The honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, will get the same allowance as that of Ministers under the current provisions and as I said, it is the same as the Ministers. Assistant Ministers will receive the same allowance under the new provisions from 1 st December. So Mr. Speaker, it is very important for us to understand that this process that we have adopted, and the honourable Prime Minister explained why this has taken this much time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has been blamed for benefitting from exorbitant travel allowances, but it is only justified. You know if you look at the previous government’s travel budget for the Prime Minister, the critics will have to understand. Let me just give you some statistics, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Say it loud:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> In the last eight years, they spent a total of $74 million.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- In domestic and overseas travel, this is travel cost of the previous Government. The honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, is … (Chorus interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- No, I am just talking about the extent of the expenditure, and let me give them some facts. From 2014 to 2022, total domestic travel of $50.4 million, for overseas travel from 2014 to 2022 - $24 million. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C.

PRASAD.- This is the figures from the Ministry of Finance:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker it is quite interesting that the honourable Leader of the Opposition become so confused because he was part of the decision in 2016 to increase the allowance in a way that it became so exorbitant. It is again, Mr. Speaker, absolutely important for us to remind those people on the other side</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2156 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023 that these are the very people who did not follow the process, who hid the information from the public and here is the Government, here is the Prime Minister who at the beginning of the term of the Government announced that we will be reducing the allowances and salaries. We have kept the 20 percent reduction on the salaries as well. I am raising this Mr. Speaker because it is important for the people of this country to know, and the confusion that is coming from the Opposition. But tomorrow what they will do Mr. Speaker, Sir, when they go out, they will still go and talk about overseas trips. Honourable Ketan Lal posted it on his Facebook page. He talks about the Prime Minister’s travel allowance, he talks about the $10,000 allowances. This is what they do but when they come here in Parliament they talk about the processes. The honourable Leader of the Opposition should actually look at what some of these Members of Parliament are writing and saying before he comes here in this Parliament and says …. (Hon. K. K. Lal interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is the hypocrisy that I am talking about from the Opposition. Mr. Speaker, this is a very timely motion by the honourable Prime Minister, and I hope the Opposition will change their mind and they will support this motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Discipline Sir:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Yes:</span> Honourable Ketal Lal, I heard you very clearly when you uttered the words “hopeless Government”. I want to caution you, again, please those who are seating on this side have received the mandate from the people to be on this side and as well as on your side, so let us respect it. There is no such thing as a hopeless Government. I hope you will be mindful of that, honourable Lal. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the honourable Members for their contributions. I reiterate that the motion is for a reduction in the allowances and is based on section 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014. I read again section 13 and quote: “Parliament may issue separate determinations at different times for different positions.” Based on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and based on an earlier attempt in accordance with our promise to reduce our salaries and allowances, we tried earlier but we were advised to go about it this way while the Remunerations Committee continues its work. That is why we have come up at this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Those of us that started at the very bottom scale of our careers know the difficulties that are currently faced by those that are at the bottom rung of their careers. So, when you come to this age and to these positions and realise that you are comfortable, perhaps, too comfortable. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this issue was raised in Cabinet when I came back from my first trip to Kiribati, and I realised that I did not use the allowances given to me. I said, “what are these allowances for, why do we get them if we are not going to be needing them?” So, I asked the staff in the office and we have been working at it and we have arrived at this.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report - Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 2157 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members for their contributions and because we are allowed to do that under section 13 of the Act, we brought it up this time and I am sure we will be voting, probably according to our party instructions, but, voting with a clear conscience that we are doing this, not only for ourselves but for the people who have a more difficult life than we are enjoying at this time. I commend the motion to the Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Just a point of clarification, again, honourable Members, on the mentioning of honourable Radrodro. There were ae few of us in the Opposition then that did not agree to this rise in the allowances. That included me, honourable Radrodro, honourable Bulitavu and are few others. After so many years, the honourable Prime Minister had to go between us and our fellow Members to try and get a better understanding of each other and a way forward for us Members of the SODELPA Party then. That, in a nutshell, is how it affected us. When we started receiving the allowance, after becoming Members of the Standing Committee, then we realised, it was a hefty increase - very, very big increase, and now we have this motion before us. Question put. Votes cast: Ayes - 28 Not Voted - 5 - 21 Abstained Motion agreed to.</p></body>
