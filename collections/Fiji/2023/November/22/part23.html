<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>Reply to Written Question No. 181/2023 tabled on Wednesday, 22 nd November, 2023 by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Ref. Page 2141) MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATERSWAYS (Honourable V. T. T. K. Rayalu) Response to the Question by honourable I. S. Vanawalu is as follows: The Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways constructs farm roads primarily to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the rural farmers through provision of necessary infrastructure and resources that will equip them to enhance their production to meet local and market demand. The strategic intention of this program not only explores available market opportunities but establishes a workable framework for the efficient and effective participation of all players in the supply chain. The programme aims to: establish and expand commercial ventures with adequate resources and support; (a) (b) develop efficient and effective strategies for the entire supply chain, from production to marketing; (c) promote key commodities such as yaqona, ginger and turmeric; and (d) develop rural areas through an integrated approach. A total of 157 farm roads were constructed and completed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways in the past eight years, that is, from 2014 to 2022. This was through the provision and facilitation of the following programmes: (a) Rural and Outer Island Programme (b) Farm Access Programme (c) Cocoa Farming Programme (d) Nadarivatu Farming Programme (e) Flatland Development Programme Table 1 below shows the number of farm roads completed by Division and Province from 2014 to 2022.

In this financial year (2023-2024), the Ministry intends to construct 2 new and upgrade 167 existing farm roads with a budget allocation of FJ$2 million to enhance food and income security and exports. Table 2 below shows the number of farm roads the Ministry is planning to construct this financial year.

The development of new farm roads and improving the existing ones will not only connect farming areas to markets but also improve farmers' livelihoods and grow Fiji's Agriculture Sector.
