<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Banning/Regulating Pornographic Sites in Fiji (Question No. 172/2023) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: There are some reports that have linked the increase in sexual related crimes to pornography. Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co- operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament if there are plans to ban or regulate pornographic sites in Fiji? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tuinaceva for his excellent question. Mr. Speaker, when I first saw the question, what immediately came to my mind was, how have we got into this situation where this sort of questions are being asked in Parliament? Why are we asking this kind of questions? Sir, in other words, what were the other people doing before we got to this stage?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.:</span> Oh, come on! Just answer the question.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- You can talk about pornography, you can talk about drugs – all the social ills that we have inherited in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker. That is why when I talk about rebuilding Fiji, it is not only the economy, but there will also be a social rebuild and a moral rebuild that has to happen in Fiji. As Michelle Obama said, “When they go low, we go high”, so the answer to the question, Sir, is my attempt at going high. Firstly, I would like to thank the honourable Tuinaceva, once again, for a very serious question and it is a question that I rise to respond to, it is a very important question and it is a major problem, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am also mindful that the relationship between pornography and increased sexual-related crimes is a complex and much debated topic as it sparks privacy, freedom of expression, security censorship, technological and individual liberty considerations. With that being said, this warrants the nation’s attention, and I am sure that there is consensus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on both sides of Parliament that any crime, including what is being discussed here today which is sexually related crimes are a major concern, including the potential harms of excessive pornographic consumption.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2125 Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the permission of the honourable Prime Minister, I will be tabling a proposition to Cabinet, to create a nationwide taskforce perhaps, on a bipartisan basis to address this issue. Just some information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding web traffic to pornographic sites, the information is both, instructive and somewhat concerning. For one network provider in Fiji, Sir, over the past three months, there has been about 626.13 terabyte of data consumed which was related to adult content and porn alone, ranking as one of the top 10 most used data traffic. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put this into context, the 626 terabytes of data is approximately equal to the amount of data stored in a 100 million books. For a period of one month, from another network provider in Fiji, they found that the total data content was 92 terabytes, which was about 1.6 percent of their total data volume for one month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, effectively tackling these social ills requires a concerted effort and multi- stakeholder engagement targeted at addressing the root cause including increased education and awareness campaigns to our people on developing healthy attitudes towards sex, including importance of consent and what it means. That is what we intend to prioritise, Sir, through Cabinet approval. We will carry out these consultations on a bipartisan basis with diverse stakeholders to ensure that we identify the root causes and assess the solutions available and agree on an approach to address this holistically. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are emerging technological solutions that can be considered as part of our assessment, such as filtering systems which can block child sexual exploitation material or upcoming technologies that are still evolving such as age verification or age assurance systems whereby access to explicit content is not accessed by children. We are also mindful that there are ways to by-pass restrictions or blocking, for example, by using proxy servers or VPNs, you can access blocked websites through mimicking access virtually from another country of all websites including blocked content. So collectively, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to identify the appropriate interventions that will address the root cause. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the different approaches, that we are looking and in partnership with the Ministries, Online Safety Commission, the Police, Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, the private sector and of course, Members of the other side, we can turn the tide on this societal blemish. With these few words I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute on this very important question. I thank you. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important question, and it is not about going high or low. It goes to the level where our young people are affected. Recently, there was an article in one of the local newspapers where there is an App. called “Telegram” and nude images of young girls have been shared on that platform. This was reported to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Police Force, but since this question has come to Parliament and there are many people also hearing us ask this question and get a response from the relevant Minister. Will the honourable Minister consider immediately getting the networks to ban such Apps. which are sharing nude contents of young females who are traumatised and who are at the verge of committing suicide because of their images being shared by these criminal offenders online, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hope the answer was very clear. You cannot just go around unilaterally, you may have done that in the past, in your Government, but in</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2126</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 this Government, we consult. These are very sensitive issues that need proper consultation. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- It is not a matter of consulting:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- They need proper consultation. We are inviting you. You did nothing for 16 years. You did absolutely nothing on this issue. That is why we are here. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is why we have ended up here. They have done nothing. Honourable Lynda Tabuya had mentioned in Parliament many times and you did nothing! Shame on you! (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are asking us to fix your problem. All I am saying is, let us work together on it. We will do consultations.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Scam taskforce:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> You should listen, you will learn a few things. You are young. What I am saying is that we will actually work together on this and come up with concise solutions for the betterment of the country and I hope that the other side will actually put their hand up and let us work together on it because it is a very serious problem. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise, I have been having a little bit of a hearing problem today, so I am just not aware that the question has been changed. I have to re-direct it to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, but I want to thank him for the feedback or response. I am aware of the big task there to get this fixed and done and I want to thank him that he is talking about the consultations and all other talks that you need to go through in order to address this problem. Something that I want to say, yes, I am the author of the question. It was nothing really political when I thought about bringing the question to the House. I know it is a big problem out there. I have seen lives being destroyed because of this pornography so when I put the question across to the team to the party if we can this ask this question in Parliament because it was all about saving our children. Update on Changes to Bus Fare Programme (Question No. 173/2023) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection update Parliament on the changes to the Bus Fare Programme as announced in the 2023-2024 Budget? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. This question has come about as a result of inquiries that have been made by the public as well as</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2127 our Members and Members of the Opposition. I was particularly asked by honourable Naivalurua on this issue of the bus fare and the policy of Government but let me explain a bit about the Programme. The Bus Fare Programme, as you know, is one of the many programmes targetted to addressing the needs of our vulnerable population. It is meant to help our beneficiaries of over 60 years old and our people living with disabilities. In order to qualify, Mr. Speaker, Sir, first you provide your birth certificate, as well as a letter from the disability organisation to support the fact that you are living with a disability and there is an application form. The colour-coded bus fare identification card, it is red for persons living with disability and yellow for elderly persons. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bus fare programme which started in 2011 with about 22,000 beneficiaries, we now currently have 42,000 beneficiaries in August, 2023. The initial monthly top up ranges from $40 at the commencement and then later was decreased to $20 and then a further reduction to $10 during COVID-19. Then it was later restored to $25 a month. The 2022-2023 Budget, $75 for every three months, it was implemented. In this financial year, the bus fare programme needed to be amended in terms of the top up and I will explain why. We first changed it to $25 a month because we found out recipients by giving them $75 for three months, there were recipients who were running out of that and were not budgeting for the three months so that it lasted them for three months. They would run out quickly, so $25 a month was implemented. The other change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which I believe is what we have been asked about as a government is that we have found over 50 percent of our active beneficiaries (over 24,000) have been accumulating balances in their e-transport cards, so they have been accumulating these balances. It would range $25 to $300, so the Government has been topping up cards of our recipients and over 50 percent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not use it or do not utilise it. There was a big budget from the Ministry that was going to this. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we came into Government by the last quarter, we had a $12 million shortfall in terms of our welfare assistance because this was being paid to users accounts and they were not being utilised. We had to review that, Sir, and look at a better way of doing this which had been done by the previous Government but was changed recently. What has happened in this fiscal year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that it is reverted to the $25 a month but based on utilisation. The top up is on what you actually use to get back to $25. Yes, we have those that utilised this full amount and have been affected and they have come to address it with us but the fact that we have over 50 percent we have not utilised and have got balances even up to $300 and there is room for abuse in terms of other members of the family using the card, Sir. The bus drivers do not necessarily distinguish or ascertain if you are over 60 when you are using the card. They just take the money, that is income. They let them swipe, it is being used by others who are not entitled to this particular benefit. The method of this top-up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is sustainable and it ensures that the funds provided to improve accessibility are efficiently use. There is always room for improvement. We get the feedback from our people living with disabilities that the buses are not disability-friendly, they cannot use it. We are doing a review of that programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and discussing with the Ministry of Finance whether we need to convert this particular utilisation thing into cash. Just like we have done the Food Vouchers into cash in this current year, we are looking at whether we should do this top-up to cash instead of it being put into their cards and using their cards.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>2128</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Our elderly do find it difficult to take the bus at times, our people living in rural and remote areas do not have bus services so they want to see how we can help them that they can have access to carrier services and minibuses and this is part of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to consider converting this particular allowance into cash something that we could consider in the next financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you also heard that there is a possible review of the eTransport card system and so if it is converted into cash and perhaps, they can still use it on the bus or use cash on the bus or have it provided also for other forms of transport and not just the public buses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is always room for improvement, but I hope this is clear to the public - the need for the reconsideration of the policy to keep topping up $25 every month regardless of utilisation and the need to look at a more efficient way of assisting our people and that is to replace only what is utilised. I hope that is clear Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is the response to the question. Thank you. HON. T. N. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, are there provisions for special case that have special needs? People might be travelling up and down because they need to do it, for example, going to hospitals and that will be more than $25, $25 it would take someone travelling from Sigatoka to Suva that is one way. In those kind of situations, how do we deal with that? Are you planning to give some flexibility on that? Some allowance? Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a question. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a difficult one to consider in terms of case by case basis if those who are frequently using for those purposes, but I do note that there is a general increase in the social welfare allowance for our elderly and for our people who live with disabilities all around in the current budget year. So, we hope that that will assist them, but we need to keep it consistent because of the need to be able to meet the budgetary needs of the bus fare assistance, but hopefully, we can consider an increase year after year as we go on, depending on the budgetary allowances from the Government. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Government is in the process of changing the e-ticketing system, and of course it is linked to the bus fare programme and the changes to increase efficiency and transparency. How is that change going to solve some of the current challenges the bus fare programme has faced? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not in the position to answer what the review contains, that is in another Ministry, I think Ministry for Transport, but we certainly will work together in terms of ensuring that they are consistent. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is related to this change that took place where previously $75 was given for three months, and now it is $25 a month. The question is, as asked by the honourable Member, when he mentioned that there are people who want to travel from Western side to come to MIOT Hospital or wherever if they need some assistance. When $75 were given for three months, they were able to adjust the expenses and they were able to utilise that. There was no issue whatsoever, but now, with this monthly payment of $25, can the honourable Minister explain whether the cost of dishing out this $25 has also increased every month? Previously, when you give $75 out for three months, that was one time cost that means four times it was being processed, and now, it is processed every month, so what is the difference in the cost? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the administrative task of putting it in every month according to Vodafone, it does not cost them. They are just basically assisting us to deposit it every month into the cards but because we made the appeal that we actually had a number</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2129 of recipients who ran out of their balances before the end of the three months, that they were not able to manage, the $25 a month helped them to be able to budget it. We have been able to work that out with Vodafone and all the providers that they could top up every month. Establishment of Roadside Stalls (Question No. 174/2023) HON. A. N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, the Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications Government’s plans to assist farmers in the rural communities by establishing roadside stalls to help them sell their farm produce? inform Parliament on HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, basically, the Government will continue the programme of installation of roadside stalls. It is a very good programme that was introduced by the previous government. We believe that it has contributed greatly to economic activity amongst the rural communities as well as farms. The stalls in Navua are classic examples of how well- presented stalls can actually attract a lot of businesses and we are keen to actually continue the support. One other thing, perhaps when I saw the question, we probably will look at doing is the connection between the farmers and where the stalls are actually being installed and how we can overlay that with the other additional MSME assistance that we have available for all farmers around Fiji. That is just something we will also endeavour to do as part of supporting the farmers. Of course, the support stimulates economic activity and creates economic opportunity for the rural farmers. To date we have 103 stalls already installed, which is quite significant and they are in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu as well. We are working very closely with the turaga ni koro, of course, there is wear and tear on these stalls and we are trying to work with the turaga ni koro or community leaders to ensure that the stalls are well kept. Some of the stalls have been there for some time and need improvement or replacement. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also looking at exploring Public-Private Partnerships to try and encourage the building of more stalls that can help assist farmers. If there are any specific requests that the honourable Tuicolo may have in mind, I invite him to contact the Ministry and we are happy to look at the request and that applies to all of us in the august Chamber. We are happy to have a look. The budget was not that large this year and that is why we are looking at Public-Private Partnerships but going forward, we will continue to work on what I believe is quite a very good initiative in terms of trying to support rural farmers. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many such good initiatives by the FijiFirst Government, honourable Minister, this is just one of it. Instead of just microwaving and presenting, if you can tell us how many new stalls were made this year? Also, a caution, for this particular programme, it is not about people bringing requests to the Ministry or to you, there is a transparency involved where it is advertised, and people apply for it. There is a strict criterion which one has to follow, just for your information. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment like I said, there is a programme of repairs being done to stalls and also we are looking at requests. There are currently requests from several places, Serua, and other locations that are being looked at.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>2130</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 One of the things that intrigued me about the cost of the stalls is they appear quite high, so I have asked that to be reviewed as well. At the moment, one stall is costing between $25,000 to $30,000. Similar to the road situation, we might just need to have another look at that. I do accept that it has to be kept Category 5 designed which is probably the reason, but we will just look at that as well just to make sure, even thinking that maybe perhaps we can get the communities to get involved …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> So, answer the question.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- As I have said, we are repairing some of the stalls and then we are also looking at where to deploy other stalls. Volunteer Service Abroad of New Zealand (Question No. 175/2023) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on the Agreement between the Ministry and the Volunteer Service Abroad of New Zealand? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the Agreement between the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations and the Volunteer Service Abroad of New Zealand and I thank the honourable Member for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of background, the Volunteer Service Abroad (VSA) is New Zealand’s largest and most experienced volunteer agency, working on international development, similar to the Australian Volunteer International (AVI) and USA Volunteer (USA Peace Corp). Sir, VSA is a New Zealand registered charity agency that is non-religious, non-political and a non-governmental organisation. Operating since 1962, VSA is New Zealand’s facilitator of the National Volunteering Development Programme funded under the New Zealand Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of the Aotearoa New Zealand Aid Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, VSA brings people together from New Zealand and the wider Pacific to share skills and experience, working to transform lives and create a fair future for all. Sir, VSA operates under five broad thematic areas, and they are: (1) business and economic growth; (2) health and well-being; (3) education; (4) environment and climate change; and (5) agriculture, fisheries and food security. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Pacific Island countries and organisations that are currently partners with VSA are Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Tonga, PNG, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Bougainville and the United Nations and council of regional organisations of the Pacific agencies operating in Fiji.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2131 Through VSA volunteers and partnerships, it has helped many Pacific developing countries address their development needs across many sectors including education, agriculture, fisheries, health, climate change, disaster risk reduction and good governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a wide consultation with key stakeholders and line ministries including the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was conducted before a proposal was submitted to Cabinet for approval. For the record, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Agreement has now been approved by Cabinet for implementation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final signing of the agreement between the Ministry and VSA, New Zealand is yet to be done. The signing formalities and the date is being arranged by the VSA officials of New Zealand and the New Zealand High Commission in Suva has planned for Wednesday, 29 th November, 2023. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. At the outset, I want to inform Parliament that the honourable Minister has handed in the report that was promised by him so I want to thank him. MR. SPEAKER.- Provided it to you after lunch, honourable Member?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> A bit later in the evening, Sir, but I got it at the end of the day.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> It is still after lunch?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Yes, yes.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament how many volunteers have been engaged from January to-date under our current volunteer scheme programme? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, that is a new question, I will get the answer for him later on. MR. SPEAKER.- You showing some very interesting signs, honourable Premila Kumar. The floor is yours. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to be corrected here, but I am under the impression that the VSA programme has already been running in Fiji and it is not a new one. Under the VSA programme, we had an officer from New Zealand working on the Housing Policy at the Ministry of Housing, so I need clarification on that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we are in the process of signing a new Agreement.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity. It is on the idea of volunteers and I thank the honourable Minister for this new signing which we look forward to a lot of benefits. There was a programme that we used to have where people who had retired from Fiji, we work with the countries like New Zealand to get them to become volunteers in other countries that they were paid. I know you will tell me that this is a new question, but is this something you are still pursuing?</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>2132</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> I think it is very similar, thank you.</p><p>Policies on Bus Service (Question No. 176/2023) HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on policies that are in place when bus companies stop service delivery to the public for any particular route? MR. SPEAKER.- You walk, honourable Member. I am just joking. (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. Sir, first and foremost all road users, all vehicle owners, passengers and permit holders for Public Service Vehicles are governed by the Land Transport Act 1998 and its corresponding Land Transport Regulations 2000. Section 65 of the Act mandates that permit holders must adhere to their permit conditions. Bus companies are provided with permits called “Road Route Licence”, which authorises the transport of passengers and goods in three categories: (1) State service which is scheduled service along a specified route between terminating points with stops intended to meet the needs of persons along or in the facility of the route. (2) Express service which is scheduled service between terminating points with or without a limited number of stops at hotels or towns, intended to meet the general needs of the public. (3) Shuttle service which is services within a suburb to meet the needs of passengers on a regular basis. Upon issued with such permits, bus companies are mandated under the Act to provide the necessary services. The services are provided as approved timetable or schedules under the road route licence. Failing to follow the approved timetable containing the routes and scheduled times, the bus company can be penalised under the Act for not complying to its permit conditions. The onus is on the bus company to inform the LTA if it is unable to provide the services to a particular route so that the LTA may seek alternative service providers to provide such necessary services. If the bus company does not notify the LTA and continues breaching its permit conditions by not providing the services stipulated under the Act and the road route licence, then the LTA must be notified of these lack of services. The LTA will then invoke Regulation 12, these are proceedings under the Land Transport Public Service Vehicle Regulations 2000 where the bus company must show cause to the LTA as to why LTA should not vary, suspend or cancel the road route licence due to its lack of services. This year the LTA has invoked the proceedings on two road route licence operators and two minibus operators due to breaches in the permit conditions. The Authority has also implemented policies and guidelines derived from the Act to ensure public transport is maintained or enhanced and this includes the revised guideline and quality assurance maintenance system which allows LTA management and board to carry out, follow internal processes, allow for sharing of routes with other operators and approval is given by Chief Executive Officer if temporary arrangement is for one month. If temporary arrangement is more than one month to cover that area, the LTA can consider further actions and, of course, the Public Service</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2133 Vehicle show cause policy. Again, this is derived from Regulation 12, if a condition subject to which the permit was granted has not been complied, the Authority is satisfied that the breach is serious frequent and causes inconvenience or danger to the public. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Authority has suspended or cancelled a permit, the LTA also implements internal measures to ensure the public transport services are not affected. An immediate action that LTA can take and has set as precedence for the PSV Tribunal is that the closest bus operator to the affected area may provide temporary services whilst the Land Transport Authority takes more formal processes such as calling for expressions of interest. The Land Transport Authority has invoked certain policies in certain cases in the West where the bus operator was not able to provide the necessary services due to financial constraints, and some of the immediate actions on this in the interior of Nadi enabled other providers such as minibuses to cover that area on a temporary basis. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, I think you have explained very well all the provisions and the laws involved to deal with those operators who fail to provide the service. You mentioned something about the moving of Regulation 12 to cancel or suspend permits. But the problem is still there where lots of complaints from the public about services which is still the failure of most operators to provide the service. There is a lot of that coming. I know Baulevu, there is a lot of theft coming from Nadi and the colo of Nadi. I think it may be to do with the lack of response or slow response to deal with those issues. Will the Ministry be able to look into that and get some kind of database to collect these kinds of complaints coming because it is really getting bad? We are receiving complaints from people telling and begging us to do something. We promised them that we will take it up to the Minister if they can solve this problem. I know the show cause is there but the process is a bit longer. By that time most of our people are being affected and continues to be a problem with the travelling public. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Coalition Government, we had established that the Land Transport Authority has been under-funded under the FijiFirst Government. In collaboration with the honourable Minister of Finance, we have increased the budget and there was a continuous issue about human resources shortages within the LTA, including poor monitoring and enforcement. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Operational? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- With an increased budget, we are engaging in more recruitments for the monitoring part which has been a serious problem and that will partially address that. We are looking at other measures too but that was one of the main problems and we are working on that. The other one is catching up on the LTA facilities around the country, we are looking at upgrading the North. So, with those upgraded facilities, with up-to-date equipment and human resources, you will not have the situation where the FijiFirst Government went to do a commissioning and planted a coconut tree. That coconut tree is now matured without the office which was supposed to be built. (Laughter) The Coalition is now bearing fruit by building that office which was commissioned but not built.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>2134</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, question to the honourable Minister: the service providers want to continue with the licences that they have been provided with, but one of the big factors here is the condition of the roads. Honourable Minister, travel to Korovou one of these days from Kasavu, you pass Logani down to Nadaro, you have been sleeping on the job. Come away from the politics and fix the roads. What are you going to do with the road conditions because that is what the service providers are waiting for. They want to continue with the service, it affects the people but Government has to fix the roads. What are you doing with the current road conditions? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we are always going back to the roads. That is always a valid concern, but I would like to reiterate again the situation we faced when we came in regarding Fiji Roads Authority whereby December, the FijiFirst had already expended everything. There was nothing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Admit! Paisa nai he.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is more than one year:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> An analysis of the accounts revealed that even the retention funds normally kept for refund to the contractors was used from the bank and there were no emergency funds put aside for roads by the FijiFirst Government, so these are the complexities we face. (Honourable Members interject) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Not only that, as I had mentioned, the removal of Public Works Department (PWD), the depots and all that, but now we are building that up. It takes a while to build it up, we do not just come in and immediately everything is there. We reform and rebuild. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Oh, he was the Infrastructure Minister here, but the honourable Minister will understand the process that rebuilding takes time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Now, you understand the process.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> After one budget everything should be in place and the next budget, everything should be 100 percent but on the roads, we are working.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B.

SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I really admire how the honourable Minister is so confidently incorrect at most times. The question has spoken about policies and laws but in this 11 th month, a lot of communities are complaining that the service delivery by the bus companies are not provided. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister that when people are not able to move, the economy is not able to move, education, employment and everything is affected so what magnitude of impact does this have on our economy? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is hard to analyse the magnitude of the impact of non-delivery of services that sounds like a master thesis which honourable Ketan Lal was supposed to do. (Laughter) Issuance of Business Licences in Municipalities (Question No. 177/2023) HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on whether the Town and City Councils will be given the authority to process and issue Business Licences under their Municipality? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question before Parliament this afternoon, I would like to pay my tribute and express my heartfelt condolences to the Vanua o Nabukebuke, Solevu Bua, Vanua o Nabukebuke Namosi on the passing on of the Radini Vanua o Nabukebuke, Namosi. Our prayers and thoughts are with the Vanua and Turaga Vunivalu na Tui Namosi in his time of sorrow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my response to this question is based on economics of business licence management. The focus is on the efficiency and the effectiveness of business licence management. The relocation of Business Licence Act 2020 was a move to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and improve ease of doing business in Fiji. However, it is regrettable that the execution of this decision has some shortfalls of some deficiencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to contextualise the issue of doing business, our business licencing 2019 World Bank doing business Report states that small or medium size businesses in Fiji require an average of 40 days, remarkably 28 percent to 30 percent of this time which is equivalent to 11 days was consumed by the business licencing process. An overall cost incurred by individuals to initiate such businesses in Fiji amount to $1,600 with business licence fees ranging from $100 to $500. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issuance of a business licence was contingent upon obtaining approvals from various regulatory agencies including Occupational Health and Safety with the Ministry of Labour, the National Fire Authority and the Ministry of Health. In principle a Council was tasked to ensuring that all necessary approvals were granted before issuing the business licence. However, concerning practice emerge Councils through bylaws introduced business licences requirements for the same type of business across different jurisdictions. This meant that a business aiming to operate a multiple town sets to navigate varying sets of requirements and fees for the business licence.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>2136</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in practical terms Councils took an unreasonable amount of time ranging from one to three months and in some extreme cases over a year to issue business licences. The situation underwent a significant shift in 2020 when the Business Licence Act was revoked, subsequently World Bank conducted a survey to gauge the impact of business in terms of savings. The 2022 findings revealed that the removal of the business licence requirement led to substantial savings in compliance cost, amounting to almost $3 million in a single year. So, this information underscores the significance of streamlining the business licensing process, as it not only reduces bureaucratic hurdles, but also contributes to the substantial financial relief for businesses operating in Fiji. The perennial issue plaquing our councils and licensing agencies is not the absence of business licence, but the lack of enforcement. This problem has worsened over the years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, countries such as New Zealand, Georgia and Singapore are models for not requiring business licence, but we cannot overlook the robust regulatory frameworks and efficient enforced mechanisms these countries have in place. It takes an average of one and a half day to start a business in these nations, because they have streamlined processes and stringent enforcement, and not because they have eliminated the need for licences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, revoking the Business Licencing Act should have been accompanied by a comprehensive strategy to enhance coordination amongst councils, licensing agencies, and Registrar of Companies and Fiji Revenue and Customs Services. Transparency between these agencies is surely lacking, hindering informed decision making by councils and perpetuating a lack of accountability. The solution is ensuring seamless information flow, data sharing between agencies and accountability. Transparency and coordination must be more than a buzz word it should be the pillars of effective governance. Councils need the tools to monitor business activities within their jurisdiction and act swiftly when violations occur. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to making it easier for businesses to operate in Fiji, the focus would be on strengthening and enforcing enforcement agencies, such as, the Ministry of Labour, National Fire Authority, Ministry of Health and the Liquor Licencing Board. Legislative reviews should empower these agencies with the authority to conduct spot checks and impose substantial penalties, shifting the burden on compliance rightfully onto business operations. In our relentless pursuit of effective governance, the Ministry is actively engaged in collaborative initiatives with councils, aiming to enhance coordination with licencing agencies. Pivotal strategies in this endeavour is the establishment of the MOU between the councils and key entities, such as Registrar of Companies and the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services. This strategic partnership will facilitate the exchange of tailored information providing councils with a comprehensive overview of registered businesses within their jurisdiction, including details on the nature of their operations. Through this MOU, the FRCS will furnish essential data regarding the operational status of these businesses. Concurrently, the work towards the formation of Divisional Coordination Committee is testament to our commitment to transparently share information on approved business operations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, empowered by this well government information, councils will be able to proactively notify relevant agencies in the event of potential breaches. This heightened vigilance will be further re-enforced by councils making readily available agencies the scheme plan for municipal boundaries. This plan meticulously identifies the permissible types of business activities within the specific areas, ensuring a clear and enforceable framework. I reiterate, our unwavering</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2137 commitment to fostering an environment where doing business in Fiji is not only streamlined, but also very cost effective. Elections are testament to this dedication as we diligently rectify past mistakes, simultaneously, as we are steadfast in our resolve to safeguard against any potential violation of laws, reinforcing the relationship between business facilitation and regulatory compliance. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this collaborative measures underscored education to creating a business landscape in Fiji that is both conducive to growth and in adherence to legal frameworks and I thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir to respond to the question in this august House this afternoon. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to say that when the honourable Minister was speaking on this subject, it reminded me of 2019 and 2020 where the staff of the Ministry of Industry and Trade worked extremely hard to bring about this reform in the business licensing. So, all that was done, and it is good to hear that it is continuing so this is another initiative of our government the FijiFirst Government but we thank you for continuing with it as we say microwaving, so it is continuing. But, my question to you is, there was a problem with the explosion of informal businesses that were operating informally from residential houses and the issue was mainly related to the registration of businesses/business registry and the problem was that they just gave an address and sometimes the address is residential address and they think that because the companies office have registered it under a residential address so I can operate from here and that was something that the Ministry of Local Government was trying to deal with it. So, if you can tell us whether any work has been done in that area because that is very critical. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my response this afternoon, I was just emphasising on the economics of business management. It does not mean that it will continue with its process because there are some issues that have been raised by some of the councils that I had visited on the possibility of reverting to the old process. It is something that we are also reviewing at the moment, and there is no guarantee that we will continue with the process and that is something that we are going to do. As we bring about changes, we need to look at all the stakeholders that are involved, one of the issues that some of these councils have forfeited is the fees from issuing business licenses and there are some other benefits that the councils went to do that actually centralised or even regulate their reducing of business licence. So, that is something that we are also going to consider and review. Perhaps, on the issue of having difficulties with the registration of businesses, especially by those who live and do not have access to the internet and also for those who live in the outskirts of towns and cities, that is something that the Ministry of Trade and Commerce is working on right now with our Ministry - an online platform that would be able to include all the stakeholders that are involved in the registration of business because once we digitalise our process, we will be able to get all the information on one platform that we will be able to share and gather information that are relevant and also necessary for those that are going to apply or those that are going to register online. MR. SPEAKER.- The question by honourable Sachida Nand has been made redundant in view of the statement made by the honourable Minister for Agriculture. We will jump right to the eighth Oral Question for today. (Question No. 178/2023 was withdrawn)</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2138</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Labour Reforms Consistent with Labour Laws (Question No. 179/2023) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on Labour Reforms consistent with the ideals and principles of the labour laws as required and set out by the International Labour Organization? HON. A. D. SINGH.- I rise to respond to the question and I thank the honourable Member for asking. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the subject of labour reforms is quite substantial, and I intend to dwell on this topic in-depth when I present a Ministerial Statement in the next sitting. However, for this response I am, therefore, going to be brief. Sir, Fiji has ratified 39 Conventions and one protocol of which nine are Fundamental Conventions, four Governance Conventions and 26 Technical Conventions. The Fiji Government had incorporated the social justice principles of the 39 ILO Conventions and we have ratified into our labour laws. These Conventions include nine out of ten ILO Core Conventions and the ILO Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, Protocol to the Occupational Health and Safety Convention and four Priority ILO Conventions of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a fair globalisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to take you back to 2006 when you and I were both in Parliament. You were a Minister; I was with the Sector Committee on Social Services and that is when the Employment Relations Bill came to Parliament. This Bill came to Parliament after seven to ten years of discussion amongst the ERAB Members as well as the Government and we had six laws that were consolidated to develop the ERA. The Bill went through major consultations with all the stakeholders through the Employment Relations Advisory Board. The Bill was passed by Parliament unanimously. So, you and I both must get credit for that. You and I both are owed some pension. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Maybe, honourable Member. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this process, the six different components were put together in one document. While the Bill had been passed by Parliament, it could not go through Senate, so it became, instead of ERA, it was ERP 2007 when it was implemented. The best part was that this law ensured that the rights of all the different stakeholders were equally respected and catered for. It was acclaimed as a law that was in line or in compliance with the standard principles requiring the minimum standard to be met by the ILO Conventions that we had ratified. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thereafter, the unilateral amendment that came through the interim regime, the onslaught on the workers’ rights by way of a Decree after Decree and then in 2015 the elected government further exacerbated it by passing some laws and extending the Essential National Industries (ENI), at lease that we are going to discuss tomorrow; the workers lost out totally. There was nothing left for them in terms of seeking justice. We are all aware of the kind of harassment that union leaders went through. Yours truly is one of them by the way.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2139 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Shame, very poor! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, then the Fiji Trades Union Congress had no option but to seek assistance from the ILO. Somehow, honourable Usamate seems to have a very blurred idea about ILO. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- He says, we are following, we are doing things because we are being told, we are following those Conventions that we are signatory to. We made a commitment and after that we made sure that as per the requirement, those laws are enshrined in our labour laws. That is how Conventions work. When you are a member of an international organisation like the ILO where there are 187 countries, there are those countries that he had alluded to who may not have signed, but they are the best of thriving democracies where everyone’s rights is fully respected. (Hon. J. Usamate interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. A. D. SINGH.- They are fully observing the rights of the people. We are amongst those countries who signed, and we come back and then we breach. There is no point in signing when you do not want to follow it. The bottom line is that we were depriving our own people of their fundamental rights. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- And they are fully responsible for that. They are 100 percent responsible! Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2016 when the Direct Contact Mission which is a very high-powered mission, was going to come to Fiji, the former Attorney-General himself scurried to Geneva… (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- …brokered a deal, signed an agreement and witnessed by the then Director General of ILO – a big photo in the dailies with the tripartite partners and he is standing there, came back to Fiji and forgot about it.
