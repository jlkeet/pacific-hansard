<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT-MINISTRY OF CIVIL SERVICE 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT- MINISTRY OF CIVIL SERVICE 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. RATU. R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I move: That Parliament debates the ‘Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Civil Service 2016, 2016–2017, 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Annual Reports’ which was tabled on the 14 th July, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir. I beg to second the motion. Thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU. R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, before I begin, allow me to pay tribute to one of the long-serving, former civil servant and Diplomat, also a Cabinet Minister in two previous Governments, Mr. Poseci Bune. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in July of this year, and I wish to proceed directly to reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that the Committee has captured in the Report. To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were a few pertinent issues identified by the Committee which include the independence of the Public Service Commission in relation to the establishment of the Ministry of Civil Service. The types of complaints handled by the Business Unit and Customer Care Call Centre within the Ministry, the measures undertaken by the Ministry to reduce its operation costs, financial discrepancies noted in the Ministries Annual Report for the period 2016-2017. The recruitment issues identified with the Ministry of Civil Service, which were noted in the 2017 and 2018 period. The types of certification which had been issued by the Ministry as noted in the 2018 and 2019 period, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, the efforts put in place by the Ministry in terms of contribution to the achievement of SDG 5 – the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women and SDG 16 – the promotion of peace, justice and strong institutions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Ministry of Civil Service, and any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will dive straight into the recommendations put forth by the Committee for the consideration of Parliament, and these are: the Committee has recommended that the Ministry of Civil Service provide a timely submission of its Annual Reports to Parliament for effective and efficient review by the Standing Committees. The Committee commends the Ministry for responding to the issues raised by the Committee which it believes specifies the improvements and progress made and, likely to be noted in the Ministry’s next Annual Report. The Committee recommends that the Ministry continue to build its Human Resource capacity with an area focused on the gap between new incoming civil servants and civil servant retirees. The Committee recommends that the Ministry implements a Policy that should bond Graduates to the Civil Service to serve within Fiji. The Committee further recommends that the Ministry works with the National Employment Centre to retain experienced staff. The Committee further recommends that the Ministry strengthens the communication, sharing of information and data across Ministries to uplift Civil Service in all Ministries.</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2169 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee further recommends that there be certain trainings to boost performance and upskilling of civil servants. The Committee further recommends that incentives and benefits are provided to civil servants to prevent mass turn-over of staff. The Committee further recommends that the Ministry adopts the Private Sector strategy by working with the Universities to align graduates to various employment needs required by relevant ministries that is attachment programmes. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that there be an overall review of the Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS) across Government Ministries. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I urge honourable Members to take note of the Committee’s Report and I commend this Report to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and having the list before me provided by the Whips, order of speakers is as follows: (1) Honourable Hem Chand; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (3) Honourable Penioni Ravunawa; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Review Report of the Ministry of Civil Service. At the outset, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for the Report. The Ministry of Civil Service is a critical ministry. This Ministry was established in 2016 to support government ministries in carrying out their constitutional functions while maintaining its central co-ordination of key areas to ensure consistencies across the Civil Service. The Ministry of Civil Service did very well during the period under review. I have noted from the Report some key highlights and achievements of the Ministry during the period under review. One of the significant highlights is that the Ministry made significant strides in its efforts towards gender equality by achieving 59 percent of female representation through OMRS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under OMRS it is open and transparent and designed to attract people from diverse experiences and professional abilities. Thanks to FijiFirst Government for initiating and introducing OMRS. The recent selection and appointment of advisory councillors was not based on merit. Talks are that some people got selected without applying. How was the selection and appointment of advisory councillors done and who did the selection? This is the question people are asking. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They are not civil servants, get that right … HON. H. CHAND.- Due to time constraints, I will be focusing on two of the recommendations made by the Committee. I will focus on incentives and benefits to be provided to civil servants to prevent mass turnover of staff. Looking at the mass turnover of Civil Service this year, I suggest that certain incentives and benefits are provided to civil servants without delay to address the brain and skills drain to overseas employment by members of the Civil Service. The members of the Civil Service are asking for pay increase and justification of the pay increase by civil servants is based on sky-rocketing price increases in consumer goods as well as for services.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>2170 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 22 nd Nov., 2023 The cost of basic essential food items has increased, VAT has increased since 1 st August, 2023 and this has been putting pressure on civil servants. I urge Government to prioritise the civil servants’ salary review and increase civil servants’ pay as promised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now I will focus on the second recommendation that the Ministry adopts the private sector’s strategy by working with the universities to align graduates to various employment needs. Yesterday, I raised a question on market employability survey, and I was caught by surprise when honourable Minister for Education informed Parliament that Government grant was allocated to Pacific Polytechnic College without carrying out market employability survey. We should remember that this is taxpayers’ money and it should be used wisely and not willy nilly.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Nonsense:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this is questionable and raise serious concerns. Taxpayers are demanding answers on why and how grant was allocated to Pacific Polytech without carrying out market employability survey. (Chorus of interjections) HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Committee’s Report and I support the motion before the House. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also support the motion before the House and I commend the Standing Committee Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Reports that are being reported on by the Committee are very clear and what they have laid out and the Report of the Committee after review of those Annual Reports are also very clear. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember the end of 1966 when Fiji was gearing towards Independence. There was a Government Training Centre and it was receiving sixth formers from schools to prepare them for employment in the Civil Service while Fiji was moving away from the colonial service to our own preparing for independence. We did a very interesting two weeks and then we were ready to be posted out as Assistant DOs and so forth. I was still waiting for mine when I got a call from camp to come and join the Army and that was the end of my Civil Service. Earlier on I had called the Permanent Secretaries to come for a workshop and I could see that they are very well qualified men and women, all highly motivated to work and I find that the recommendations are very easy to implement and we promised to do that. I am sure we can continue to develop great servants of the people in our Civil Service at the moment, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Minister responsible for the Public Service, I take on board all the recommendations and the Permanent Secretary for the Public Service and I have already put into place a programme to continue the training of particularly the senior and it go down to the Deputy Secretaries and so forth to try and adapt them and their work ethics and particularly teamwork across all Ministries so that they know what they are there for and they know the population that they are serving. I commend the civil servants for the work they are doing. They have very difficult working conditions and we also understand the fluidity in the labour market at the moment. People are so marketable, they are so well qualified and whoever comes up with a better deal they will probably</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2171 move to. That does not mean that they are not loyal, they are loyal to their performance, they would like to perform to the best of their ability where the Government can afford what they demand for their services or not it is another matter. We know there are some very highly qualified people there, who would easily get better paid job outside the Civil Service. When we cannot compete, we cannot compete and I thank the Committee for their work and I support the motion. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be given this opportunity to speak on the motion for debate this afternoon. In fact, I would like to speak on two recommendations outlined by the Committee, consolidated in their review report for the year 2016-2019. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service Reform came about during this time where the effort was put into excellence in the services of the civil servant across all Ministries and Departments. It is during this time, I remember honourable Agni Deo Singh and I were also members of the Employers Representatives in the negotiation that led up to a Job Evaluation Exercise that was effective in 2018, which saw an increase in salaries a lot for doctors, teachers and principals for schools and across the Civil Service. I thank the Committee for the recommendation to review the OMRS, as there are certain parts of the OMRS system that need to be improved in terms of the performance guideline and the rewards that are needed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report provided a comprehensive analysis of the three year-report with the Committee recommendations. Specifically, I will be focusing on Recommendation No. 8 and Recommendation No. 10. Recommendation No. 8 put forth by the Committee for the Ministry of Civil Service is to develop and implement incentives and tangible benefit for staffs across the Civil Service. The objective of this recommendation is to address the issues of massive staff turnover, as mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister, within the Civil Service. It recognises the importance of providing an attractive incentive to employees, which can contribute significantly to staff retention and overall productivity. In light of this recommendation, it is crucial for the Ministry of Civil Service to carefully evaluate the existing incentive and the benefit structure and identify areas that can be improved in the process. By introducing effective and competitive incentive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry can incentivise staff and address the problem of high staff turnover, thus, strengthen its workforce. Moving on to Recommendation No. 10, the Committee emphasised the need for an overall review of the OMRS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, OMRS is defined as a system of appointing employees based on their ability to do the job and assess against the objective selection criteria which do not discriminate or give preference to any group or individual. This recommendation aims to ensure the transparency and fairness in the recruitment process across the Civil Service. To implement this recommendation, the Ministry of Civil Service should undertake a comprehensive review of the OMRS system, as I have mentioned. This review should entail an examination of the existing policy and the regulation pertaining to recruitment, retirement and other relevant factors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by providing clarity, the Ministry can bring greater transparency and confidence in the recruitment process, promotion and also promoting a fair and equitable working environment for our Civil Service. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I extend my gratitude to the Standing Committee of Justice, Law and Human Rights for their diligence scrutiny and evaluation of the Ministry of Civil Service Annual Report, 2016 to 2019. Their effort has enabled us to commend the deliberation in Parliament today. I would like to also express my utmost support to the executives of the Ministry of Civil</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>2172 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 22 nd Nov., 2023 Service and its dedicated staff in embracing and implementing the 10-key recommendations put forth by the Committee. These recommendations hold significant potential in fortifying the Civil Service and advancing its effectiveness. I fully support the recommendations put forward by the Committee. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief. I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for pointing out the changes that the Government has already made. When we came into Government, we had promised that we will raise the retirement age from 55 years to 60 years. We have done that and it was very ill-conceived against the international thinking, where most countries were actually raising retirement age, we did the opposite, and we can see when those who were responsible for doing that, never thought about situations like these where the global labour market will change as a result of post-COVID. In 2022, we lost the largest number of people, particularly from the formal sector because countries like Australia and New Zealand provided avenues for work visa where people could go on student visa and work 40 hours. There was this huge exodus of people from, not only the civil servants, but the formal sector in Fiji as well. The decision by the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of raising the retirement age to 60 and moving away from contractual employment has actually provided much better incentives and motivation for our civil servants to do better. The recommendations that are there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to go into the details, but the Ministry is working on all of them, in particular, addressing issues of high rates of attrition. For example, the Ministry is now looking at graduate internship, making sure that we hire people from universities who are coming out as new graduates so that they go through a process of training in a workplace, attachments and then be absorbed within the Civil Service as and when needed. The use of Section 127(8) of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked about that. It is in the Constitution, there is nothing we can do about it, but this Government moved the Ministry of Public Service under the Prime Minister, under whom the Public Service Commission is also based. The Public Service Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is only responsible for appointing the Permanent Secretaries, but under the Constitution, the Permanent Secretaries has absolute power but with the agreement of the Ministers. What was happening in the past, the Ministers were actually making appointments and it happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir in many cases. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You are lying:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> In many cases, I tell you how it was happening.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.

I. B. SERUIRATU.- Point of Order. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 74. I would request the honourable Minister to bring proof about appointments being made that were made by Ministers and not according to the processes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF.B.C. PRASAD.- Let me just read this for the honourable Leader of the Opposition:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They do not want to listen to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not want to listen to the truth. Section 127(8) of the Constitution states, “The Permanent Secretary of each Ministry with the agreement of the Minister responsible for the Ministry has the authority to determine all matters pertaining to the employment.” The OMRS was a system, where the Committee will meet, make the recommendation, the final … (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Point of Order. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have raised my Point of Order and I demand that the honourable Minister bring proof to this august Parliament about the allegations that he had made, and I would kindly request a ruling on my Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I have not made a ruling yet, because his still on the floor. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition has made a Point of Order and you have listened to it, but let me just explain. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The OMRS, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministers are still signing-off the appointments, so you have a process but the final decision of an appointment through that process rests with the Minister, he does not understand that. That is what I mean when I say, the final agreement of the appointment is made by the Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- You are lying:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If the Minister does not sign it, the appointment cannot be done. That is what was happening. HON. P. K. BALA.- Enough of your lies. How can we trust this government? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Now, the Public Service Commission, despite …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … what is in the Constitution, the practise that this Government has adopted, we have empowered the Public Service Commission, we have given the appropriate budget and the Public Service Commission will review the OMRS. We have allocated $126,000 in the budget for that review so that there is no political interference in the appointment of the Civil Service.</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>2174 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 22 nd Nov., 2023 MR.

TURAGA.- It hurts. The truth hurts:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You heard what they are saying:</span> This is the fact, this is what has happened.

PRASAD.:</span> This Constitution says, “with the agreement” and if the Minister chooses not to, that appointment cannot be done. It is simple, simple language. They cannot understand this simple language and he is demanding information. One final point, Mr. Speaker, the honourable …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. Absolute hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … Hem Chand said advisory councillors, he does not know, he was a civil servant that advisory councillors are not civil servants. They are community driven and they were the biggest abusers of the appointment process of the advisory councillors.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You are making more money:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> It actually hurts them, they cannot take it because this is a government which is changing the processes, making it more transparent and accountable. And the civil servants Mr. Speaker, are happy, they are more motivated and they are coming here and not admitting that what they did in terms of retirement age, in terms of contractual employment destroyed the motivation, the incentive, the work environment within the Civil Service. This Government has restored that. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have before me two complaints that were lodged in this august Parliament. One by honourable Sachida Nand, and the other one by honourable Prof. Biman Prasad as well, similar to what has been raised in a Point of Order here. The issue about the Point of Order raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition is on the comment that was made by the Deputy Prime Minister, but I have allowed time for him to explain the reason why he said what he said. Now he is backing it up with the OMRS and what the Constitution says, so I will be delivering my two judgements on the two cases now on Friday. So, I will be given enough time for us to look over the Hansard Reports because we are trying to be very specific here, at the same time we have to allow the process for him to explain himself. So that will come on Friday before we adjourn. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments, just a little two cent contribution. I am very thankful that the honourable Minister responsible for Civil Service and the honourable Prime Minister has given confidence in this Parliament that all the</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Civil Service 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2175 recommendations by the Committee has been taken on board and that he has made programmes of liaising with his Permanent Secretary. On that note, this was a bipartisan Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am thankful that the Opposition were praising the OMRS and I am thankful to honourable Ravunawa, who has also alluded to the point that it needs a review and their recommendation came by way of bipartisan. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament so that you may enjoy the dinner that is being prepared in the Big Committee Room. We still have two more reports to go through before we finish for the night. I hope you will enjoy your dinner and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 7.06 p.m.</p><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>2176 Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2019-2020 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 8.06 p.m.</p></body>
