<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to todayâ€™s sitting of Parliament. I also welcome those who are joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. I have noticed there are a lot of new faces in the gallery. I also welcome the students from the following Universities: (1) University of South Queensland; (2) University of Sunshine Coast; and (3) Curtain University in Perth. They are accompanied by their Lecturer - Dr. Elizabeth Ryan; Elders - Mr. Wanye Fossey and Mrs. Janet Mullenger-Barnard and Directors - Sheila Houston, Ms. Beeca Hancock and Ms. Lavenia Warman who happens to be a former classmate of mine at Dudley High School. Welcome, La, and we welcome your contingent. I hope, Madam Secretary-General would be sharing some time with each and every one of you so as to see how best we can continue with this great relationship.</p></body>
