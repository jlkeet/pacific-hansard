SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Fisheries for the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 which was tabled on 14 th July, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, very briefly the Ministry of Fisheries is mandated to manage and sustain fishing activities in the Fiji waters to ensure that Fiji’s fisheries stock remain healthy and this, the Ministry continued to coordinate very well in terms of Fiji’s fishing and aquaculture programmes to ensure food security and also to facilitate growth of commercial activity that helps grow the economy. The Report Mr. Speaker, Sir, highlights the Ministry’s achievements in terms of aquaculture, research and development, inshore fisheries and of course offshore fisheries as well. Perhaps, we will just focus on the recommendations on aquaculture, particularly on the need for better equipment, the expertise and the advancement of facilities and the supply of fry and feed as well. The second recommendation is for the Ministry to ensure that there is a marked improvement in the percentage of farmers that graduate from subsistence to semi-commercial and commercial farming given the interests in aquaculture in our country. On inshore fisheries: two recommendations: (1) Ensure the assessment and management of fisheries stock; and (2) Arrange financial assistance to fishermen, upgrade physical resources such as service centres, fence and strengthen human resources, and of course the Ministry to ensure expansion of inshore farming of oysters, seaweeds, pearl, bech-de-mer, clams, salt water prawns and mud crabs. On offshore fisheries: two key recommendations: (1) The Committee recommends the review of the policies, Acts and regulations that govern the Fisheries sector to ensure that they are relevant and up to date; and of course (2) The Ministry to prioritise the training and recruitment of qualified locals and crew and collaborate with the fishing industry in terms of the acquisition of modern fishing vessels. There is a recommendation on Conservation which is very critical as well because of sustainability. There is a need to ensure that there is proper collaboration with stakeholders and that there is consensus on the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and this is respected by community at large after the MPA has been established. In terms of the Ministry resources, there are three recommendations, and I will not go into it. It is in the Report, Sir, and I recommend that Parliament takes it off these recommendations and we welcome the contribution from the honourable Members, and I put the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and for your information I have a list of speakers with me and the batting would be as follows. The batting will be led by honourable Joseph Nand, to be the followed by the honourable Minister for Fisheries, then honourable Koroilavesau and rounded off by the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before this Chamber. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee deliberated on the Report and resolved that the site visits be conducted to the three geographical divisions of Fiji. The Committee undertook a one-day site visit to the Central Division and a further one week visit to the Central, Western and Northern Divisions to verity its findings and gather valuable information from staff at the stations.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>2164 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 22 nd Nov., 2023 The Committee consulted and visited several key stakeholders that were actively involved in the fishing industry and those that were in partnership with the Ministry and the Government as a whole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding Offshore Fisheries, the Committee noted some of the challenges faced by them and those challenges are: • • • Obtaining a Fisheries Licence This takes far too much time as it involves several different agencies including the Ministry of Fisheries for the IUU Certificate, the Ministry of Health for the Health Certificate and the University of the South Pacific for conducting laboratory tests. These delays have created substantial losses to the fishing companies and have prolonged the sale of fish to overseas markets. Clearance from the Customs Department The process for obtaining clearance from the Customs Department to fish outside Fiji waters and as a result fishing companies incur unnecessary cost. The unavailability of right technology and expertise. There is also a need to purchase new vessels so that they can fish in the deeper high seas. Inconsistency in data held by the Ministry of Fisheries and the fishing companies. This needs to be updated and a proper SOP needs to be formulated so that data is valued and updated data is readily available. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as stated in the Report, the fishing companies also no longer receive assistance through the Tuna Stabilisation Fund. The Committee is concerned with the high level of illegal fishing and lack of monitoring taking place in Fiji. There is a need to strengthen monitoring and partnership with the public and raise awareness with communities. Also, Mr. Speaker Sir, in regard to Recommendation 3.1.1, the Ministry should address and nullify the key challenges in aquaculture which include the need for the latest equipment, the right expertise and advancement of facilities, supply of fry and quality feed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members for their contribution and look forward to the honourable Minister and the Ministry to oversee and respond to the recommendations made in a timely manner. I wish to acknowledge the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Fisheries in all Divisions. I support the motion before this Chamber. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a response to the Consolidated Report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for the three-year Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report for the period 2018-2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Chairperson and the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for their assessments, findings and recommendations as outlined in the Report. This will assist the Ministry in its planning and re-focusing its priorities and resources allocation to enhance service delivery to our diverse stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the Senior Executive Team and Ministry staff for the timely submission of the Annual Report to this august Parliament. I also acknowledge my appreciation to the honourable Koroilavesau who was at the forefront in the achievements as outlined in these Annual Reports.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2165 Mr. Speaker, Sir, all 10 recommendations of the Standing Committees are well noted. My response will be based on what the Ministry is currently doing to progress the recommendations. For aquaculture, the Ministry is working its level best to address the challenges identified in the report. These are the challenges that have accumulated in the past 16 years. The Ministry recognised that we cannot grow this sub-sector alone, hence, the move to engage with private sector agencies through Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the assistance of UNFAO, the Ministry is currently developing its 5-year Aquaculture Development Plan, which will be finalised in quarter three. This plan aims to address the aquaculture challenges such as commodity development, high cost of feed, expertise, hatchery production, resource allocation, etcetera, and will be the pathway for rapid growth for the aquaculture sector. This development plan is indeed long overdue, and the Coalition Government is here to make it happen. In the interest of time, allow me to list three key initiatives that are well underway to progress the recommendations under Coastal Inshore Fisheries. (1) The PPP is signed for mass production of seaweed. This adopts an integration model between fisheries, forestry and will extend to agriculture as part of the private sectors corporate social responsibility. (2) For promotion of diversification and resources allocation, we are strengthening the formation of fisher cooperatives and clusters in partnership with other Government agencies as a means of channelling support and the project to fisherfolks. (3) We are restoring laws and policies restricting trade of specific inshore commodities that were imposed by the previous administration. Apart from the regulations not being consulted, the decision not only affected the industrial players, but moreso Fijians who depend on these industries for their basic survival. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next months, we will finalise a few more partnership arrangements with the private sector to assist communities who are in dire need of our support. Some of these proposals were submitted to the previous government, though feasible, but were not considered. More update will be provided in this august Parliament when the engagements are sealed and implementation underway. On the recommendation on policies and legislations, I wish to advise that the Ministry will be finalising key policy legislative framework in consultation with the Office of the Solicitor-General before the end of this fiscal year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the fisheries policy and laws were shelved by the previous government for reason only known to them. My Ministry is in full support of the protection on the development of crews on fishing vessels, their safety and well-being. The approval of Fiji National Offshore Crew Policy in the last months attests to this strong commitment of the Coalition Government. The Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are areas designated and managed for the long- term conservation of marine resources, ecosystems services and/or cultured heritage. I agree that the establishment and maintenance of MPAs requires greater collaboration and consultation with key stakeholders. The MPA subject matter unveils the need to maintain a balance between conservation and production as we have multiple users of our waters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bottom line is to ensure that the communities continue to have a source of livelihood and income generation when international commitments are made when the MPAs are established.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>2166 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 22 nd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me, that people are the most important resources in any one organisation. Capacity building, training, and staff retention strategies are always part of the Strategic Workforce Plan and Succession planning of the Ministry. In my visit to all fisheries stations in the Central, Westen and Northern Divisions in the last 10 months, I can attest to the recommendations provided by the Standing Committee that the stations and quarters have really deteriorated and needed immediate renovations. For 2023 to 2024, I acknowledge the support from the Coalition Government for mainstreaming and upgrading of offices and quarters budget back to the Ministry’s budgetary allocation. In the previous administration, this was placed under Head 50 which was very difficult to access. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity and I also thank the Chairperson and the Committee for the Report before Parliament. At the outset, I would like to state my support to the motion before Parliament. What else can I say, Mr. Speaker, after the honourable Minister of Fisheries has already alluded to the various developments that he has developed over the last nine months. I can only say in the background what the recommendations that have been stated and maybe give an overview of what the Ministry had done as reported by the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report covered 2018-2021. The development on the Ministry of Fisheries was greatly challenged by a lot of work that were to be carried out when it was established as a different Ministry (an independent one in 2017). At that time the Ministry of Fisheries was tasked to establish an Inshore Fisheries and at the same time we co-chaired the Ocean Conference in New York with the Government of Sweden and then we attended COP23 in Bonn, Germany. On that note, I wish to mention the first Permanent Secretary, Commander Sanaila Naqali who was very influential in the establishment as an independent Ministry of Fisheries and also his work in Bangkok with the establishment of the various agencies that were able to assist the Ministry in the years after 2017 and 2018. Mr. Speaker, the rebuilding of Makogai as a fisheries station took a lot of time after TC Winston. The whole station was totally wiped out. It cost about $11 million to rebuild, that took a lot of energy and funds to rebuild and then we had to rebuild Caboni. It was also totally destroyed by the same cyclone - TC Winston. I must thank the Ministry staff for being able to continue the work and at the same time they were carrying out the rebuild of these two Fisheries Stations. The honourable Minister has alluded to the recommendations that had been given. Recommendation one under aquaculture, he is saying that there needs to be equipment for feed and also the supply of fry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a machine at Naduruloulou, I think that was supplied by either Taiwan or India. It has been broken down for about five years. Since the equipment was so old, we could not find the spare parts. The initiation was basically for the aquaculture farmers to bring in their feed, put it through the machine and then collect the feed and go feed whatever they are breeding - tilapia, shrimp or prawns but, unfortunately, we could not get the parts from overseas because the machine was so old.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2167 The other point that I wanted to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Recommendation 3.2.1 on Inshore fisheries on the management of fisheries stock in our coastal waters. This is a huge challenge challenge. Even though we were assisted by MPI New Zealand, the legislation took a lot of time to develop so that we are able to monitor and make the assessment. So, basically the challenge for Government now is to make sure that the recommendation that has been given is carried out. It is quite an extensive but a very expensive exercise also. I hope the honourable Minister for Fisheries will carry that forward because this will basically assist the resource owners within the qoliqoli areas. That basically covers the area from the shoreline to the outer reef. If this is funded properly and governed with the demarcated areas, for the traditional qoliqoli owners it will assist them in generating revenue out of their various boundaries. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure we have been throwing bombs at each other for long enough and I will be very brief in my contribution today. Firstly, I have to say Mr. Speaker, Sir, in rising to contribute to the Ministry of Fisheries Report, it is quite clear that the Ministry of Fisheries has been actually investing a lot into trying to develop the fisheries industry in Fiji. So, my comments will be more forward-looking rather than trying to nit-pick the Report. I agree with the recommendations made and there was one particular comment in the Report that caught my attention and is probably where our Ministry would like to focus. That was a comment, Sir, which said that “the Committee was impressed with the research undertaken by J. Hunter Pearls, and they appear to have one of the best research facilities in Fiji”. I think the key to unlocking the fisheries industry and agriculture is a concerted effort to get commercial agriculture and commercial aquaculture going in our country. That is where the Ministry of Trade is actually laser focused. We can see that there has been so much work done by all the Ministries over the last few years, but the missing equation is actually the need to attract investors to come and play in this area. I can happily report that I am being talking actively to two possible potential investors, but we need more, and I think if that happens we will surely unlock the potential in fisheries and agriculture as alluded to quite succinctly by the honourable Minister of Agriculture this morning. Secondly, Mr. Speaker Sir, I just thought to also acknowledge the comments around the fishermen in the North and the need for the NDP programme to try and link up to the Northern fishermen in terms of storage access. We are doing a lot on the supply of boats and outboard motors but I think certainly in terms of trying to get their produce to market needs freezers and that is probably an area where the Government and certainly the Ministry of Trade can assist the Ministry of Fisheries in terms of going forward in this very promising and area of high potential. Mr. Speaker, like I promised, I will be brief. I support the recommendations before Parliament and thank the Committee for their contribution in producing a Consolidated Report. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to acknowledge the honourable Members who have contributed and of course the honourable Minister as well for his response. Because it is a bipartisan report, I will hold back the rod from attacking the honourable Minister, but of course, the importance of the sector and the need for us to raise the production levels and bring in the new technologies and so forth is so important. I hope that Government will continue to support the Ministry of Fisheries.
