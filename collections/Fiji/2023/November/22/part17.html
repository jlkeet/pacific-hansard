NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017–2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 14 th July, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this is the review of the Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report. It was reinstated from the last Parliament term, most of the work was done by the previous Standing Committee pm Foreign Affairs and Defence, we just carried on from there, hence this very short report. It has recommendations and the recommendation in the Report are made applicable to that reporting period. I make this point to underscore the fact that a lot has been done by the Ministry up to when we were doing the reporting, even from when we tabled the report until today. As we had heard announcements made by the current Minister, a new ministry, now the Ministry for Home Affairs and Immigration, announcements that were made along the vein of some of the recommendations that we made. The recommendations in this Report, again, is a five-year old Report: • That priority be given to reviewing both the Police Act 1987 and the Republic of Fiji Military Forces Act 1949 and I am sure the Minister can update us on that today.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2158 Review Report - Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 The recommendations in this Report, again, it is a five-year old Report: • • That priority be given to reviewing both the Police Act 1987 and the Republic of Fiji Military Forces Act 1949 and I am sure the Minister can update us on that today. That required resources both funding and training, be given to the development of the Incident Response Management Framework. This Framework is, according to the report developed by the Ministry is for our borders. It is to complement border security where their policies and plans to enhance contingency responses in the event of a security threat to Fiji’s territorial borders. Hope that we will identify relevant agencies that are required to respond to any threat or security issue and also outline clear-cut lines of command, control and communication; easy for decision making and also for the effectiveness of the operation. There are three documents that we mentioned in the report: (1) Search and Rescue Bill; (2) National Security Strategy; and (3) National Security Defence Council Bill We are recommending that effort be made to make sure that these documents are completed, the Bill to be passed, again that was five years ago and maybe there is development around this. I know for the National Security Strategy, if the review began five years ago, it will be totally irrelevant now. So, I think it will have to be re-written so that it is line with the current security landscape, now and into the future. It was reported that for this Ministry, there were 55 percent female and 45 percent male. In the reporting year, congratulations to the Ministry and the effort towards equal opportunity employment and gender, but we ask in the report that they not only give us numbers but perhaps outline the levels of posts that females are holding. Sir, that is an introduction to this report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to inform this august Parliament that I also received a list of speakers from their Whips: (1) Honourable A. Bia; (2) Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration (3) Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and (4) Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management. HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make my contribution on the motion before Parliament. At this juncture, I would like to thank the Chairman and his Committee Members for a job well done in complying the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I bring our attention to some of the key important findings and recommendations of the Report where we can raise questions as to what has been done to try and improve the services provided by the Ministry of Defence and National Security and which report is under review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key issues highlighted in the report was the collaboration between the Ministry and various border agencies to work on upgrading and digitising Fiji’s border systems in pursuit of a contact-less process with a seamless flow of passengers.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report - Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 2159 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this digitisation process is the way to go for our border agencies and at the same time improve service delivery and improve waiting time as well for Fijians and tourists who will cross our borders. The report under review is from 2017 to 2018 and we do know that work and discussions have progressed over the years to try and implement the digitisation process. In February this year, a national consultation was organised to discuss the digitisation of the arrivals process at Fiji’s borders, as well as the guiding principles needed to achieve its national border upgrade strategy. The consultation was to allow the Ministry to work with the UNDP Suva Office to align immigration processes to the Government’s overall digital transformation strategy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the honourable Minister responsible is aware of the progress being made on this consultation report. This digitisation project at our borders will re-enforce our capacities, capabilities and systems for effective and efficient movement of travellers and cargo and strengthen links for data and knowledge sharing inter-agency and across regional cooperation. At the outset, as stated in the report and I quote, “this will greatly complement Fiji’s border security policies and plans and also will enhance our contingency responses in the event of a security threat to Fiji’s territorial borders”. With that contribution, I once again thank the Committee and support the motion before Parliament. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament. First of all, let me thank the honourable Naupoto and his Committee for the Report that they have tabled in Parliament today. As he had rightfully said that this has been a report from sometime back - 2017 to 2018. As he has rightfully commented, a lot has changed since then, from the term of the last government and the continuation of what we are doing now. So, much of these recommendations today have been addressed in one form or another. I would like to maybe just concentrate on the recommendations that are here, and inform Parliament where things are, with regards to the five recommendations so to speak. Very briefly I would say, before going to the recommendations and what they are proposing, a lot really hinges on the process of the national security and defence review, but as we all know was faced in Parliament by His Excellency the President when he opened this session of Parliament. That really is perhaps the overarching strategy, the process that will guide much of these changes that are presented here as part of the recommendations. We are going by that, and I will try just in the short time that I have just to cover it very briefly, and I know there is not enough time to do all that. Nevertheless, suffice to say that the review of the RFMF Act as it is proposed is now before the Office of the Solicitor-General. There is liaison between the Office of the Solicitor-General, the Commander of the RFMF and the staff and the Ministry in addressing, particularly the new RFMF Act that has been proposed to Government by the RFMF; the current one which is the RFMF Act 1949. As for the Police, under the strategic review, looking at security in its entirety, I had spoken about Restore Blue as the process and that is the professionalisation of the Police Force. This is an intensive work on the Police Force and what they are and what we want them to be, the restoration of professionalism in the service. It is a lot of work Mr. Speaker. At the moment, the Ministry and the Government is working with the UNDP, so there is a national consultation that begins next week on Monday and Tuesday and there is a few more to come in the second phase. So, there is public participation on how the public of Fiji can say how they want their police services to be and that is part of that process, and we see that, we will then look at the development. There are some consultations going on right now with regards to the Police Act 1987, that needs to be reviewed also to bring the police up to par, but as part of the security and strategy review in terms of our whole of our national security the Police review is also part of the process and its laws.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2160 Review Report - Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 In terms of the incidental and management response, that honourable Naupoto has alluded to, at the moment the Government is working with the Government of Japan, there’s been a number of processes, number of exercises not only with the government of Japan but also UNDP to strengthen the framework of this incident response management team. In terms of the Search and Rescue Bill, that is currently under review but at the moment we have a Search and Rescue Handbook, which was developed after this report period and that was published, I think, in 2021. The National Security Strategy of course as I said is part of the national security and the defence review and we also reviewing the National Security Defence Council per say as part of the Bill which is refer to here but at the moment it has to be reviewed also. In terms of Recommendations No. 4, Mr Speaker, I take that into account and hopefully this is something that we must improve on as noted by the Committee and hopefully when we table our next report as a Ministry into this Parliament, it is going to take cognisance of this so the Parliament can specifically recognise the kind of work that we are already doing, in terms of key performance \indicators and how it should work in the workplace. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I first wish to acknowledge the Committee once again for the excellent work and the preparation of this Report and of course I do not have much to add as well after the statement by the honourable Minister. But I am glad to see the continuity in most of the work that had been undertaken. Again, we know the importance of National Security particularly in terms of the creation of the environment for our economic growth and development as well. We are faced with so many challenges in this unpredictable world, we can say that we are safe, particularly from conventional threats but at the same time, we know how vulnerable we are when it comes to non-traditional threats, things like human trafficking, climate change, cybercrime, terrorism, drugs, et cetera, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is why as the honourable Minister has correctly stated, the overarching framework which is the National Security strategy is so important. Work has been undertaken. It took a lot of time for it to be cleared by the Attorney General, Solicitor’s General office and although the work had started before I came in as Minister very briefly in 2018, but we have managed to submit this to Cabinet, but it has not the Cabinet office, but it has not made its way into Cabinet. There are a lot of factors coming in as well, because economic security is very much related to our National Security as well, because when we have the strategy in place and the capability development particularly and other aspects that will support the National Security Strategy, that is why the status of the Economy is so important, we know what we went through, Mr Speaker, Sir. In 2019, of course, we are still recovering from that Mr Speaker, Sir, but that is where it is and our security landscape has changed and the honourable Minister did respond to the question that was raised in this House by the honourable Assistant Minister of Finance and he has stated his intentions on the work that will continue. On the Search and Rescue Bill, just very briefly when we had the opportunity earlier in this Parliament to talk about our response during COVID, I did mention about the idea of bringing together a common or one document to coordinate our National Emergency Response Framework or whatever we will call it. The same thing with the Search and Rescue Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as this is one of the recommendations. We had a difficulty when we had the incident in Vanua Levu a few years back because in the current laws aeronautical search is with AFL based in Nadi. Search and Rescue, in our maritime waters even going to Tuvalu and Wallis and Futuna, is under the Fiji Navy, RFMF and it is based in Walu Bay. Land Search is under the Fiji Police Force.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report - Ministry of Defence and National Security 2017-2018 Annual Report 2161 So that overarching framework was to bring them together and the Bill, honourable Attorney- General, I know that it is before the Solicitor-General’s Office and I hope that between the honourable Minister and yourself, Sir, this can be expedited. Human Trafficking is a major issue. I have stated it already in this Parliament. I think the only major National Taskforce has been established and the Ministry is responsible. Perhaps the major issue that we were trying to work on particularly between the two Committees particularly with the US Government as well is just the laws because they have very specific laws on human trafficking but for us our laws is very general and perhaps this review will help us to look at some of the existing laws and particularly laws for the agencies that will be responsible: all the stakeholders that come under the Committee. Lastly, on the RFMF Act Review and of course the Fiji Police Force we are thankful to the New Zealand Government for assisting in the RFMF Act review and I am sure as already alluded to by the honourable Minister it is ready now or on its way to Cabinet and of course the Police Review. There was a blunder by the Fiji Police Force because after the endorsement by Cabinet instead of just going for the consultations they used the word ‘Bill’ in that consultation when it has not come into Parliament. As alluded to, it was sponsored by UNDP and the New Zealand Government, and I am thankful that they are going to pick it up now and continue with the work. So, in a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it is important that we support the work particularly behind National Security because this will create the environment for us, whether it is investment or our economic growth and development and social protection as well and we need to support the honourable Minister, the Ministry and the agencies involved. HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide some remarks on this Review Report that is being tabled before the House. I agree with the mover of the motion that this Report is five years old and most of the works that are being reported here the update has been given by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs this afternoon or this evening. However, let me just give some brief overview in terms of the Ministry of Defence and National Security responsible for Fiji’s National Security including the defence of the coverage sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Ministry carries out this responsibility through the implementation of Fiji’s National Security Strategy and by conducting policy oversight of two of Fiji’s Discipline Forces – the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Fiji Police Force. In terms of the Budget update, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Defence and National Security was allocated a budget of $5.2 million in the 2017 and 2018 financial year for which they were able to expend $4.8 million which is around 91 percent of the overall budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the overall budget 80 percent of the budget was allocated for the operating expenditure while 14 percent was earmarked for the capital projects. The largest component of the Ministry’s budget is under SEG 1 - $1.4 million for salaries and SEG 8 - $1.8 million which caters for special expenditures including the National Security and Defence Review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 2023 and 2024 the current Budget the Ministry has allocated a Budget $12.4. million. Of this around 89 percent of the Budget is allocated for Operating Expenditure while 5 percent is earmarked for the capital projects. The largest component of the Ministry’s Budget is under SEG 1 which caters for salaries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the major increase in expenditure in 2023 and 2024 financial year results from the transfer of the Department of Immigration from the Office of the Prime Minister to the</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>2162 Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Fisheries 2018-2021 Annual Reports 22 nd Nov., 2023 Ministry of Home Affairs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the recommendations that have been tabled by the Standing Committee, most of the recommendations have been updated to the House by the honourable Minister as well as the honourable Leader of the Opposition. However, I would just like to express more on the need to prior and fast track the Search and Rescue Bill. It is very important for our country looking at the number of issues that are taking place in the country in the meantime. I can just recall back in 2019 when I was the Commissioner Northern when this Cessna 172 that belongs to Pacific Flying School was involved in an accident in the very rugged terrain in Delaikoro Mountain in Macuata. We tried to mount search and rescue and the Disciplined Forces together with National Fire Authority. In the first instance, we were very confused because there was no SOP for us to follow in terms of that operation however due to commonsense we were able to undertake that rescue operations very quickly, and I would urge the Ministry and those responsible for the Search and Rescue Bill to please enhance its enactment so that those relevant agencies are able to comprehend whenever a similar disaster takes place. Just to round off, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of some of the issues that were raised by the Office of the Auditor-General and I want to mention it in this Report because it was during the time that this Report was being scrutinised by the Standing Committee in terms of Standing Operating Procedures and some of the things that were lacking in the Ministry during that time. The Ministry should ensure that the names of the issues that have been raised by the OAG in terms of the SOP and the operation in the Ministry should be try and addressed so that encounter this same problem when a similar situation comes into place. I thank the Committee once again for a very spending their effort in trying to come up with a Report that is five years old. I thank the Chairperson and all the Members, and I do support the Report before Parliament. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- If I can just thank the staff of the Ministry, past and present, wish you well in the big role that you play in the security of our nation. I commend this Report to Parliament for noting. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
