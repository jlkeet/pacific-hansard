SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the review of the Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2093 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review was made in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(c) which mandates the Committee to look into the issues related to forestry, agriculture, mining, environment, fisheries, water and marine services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all support the work undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, given its significance in terms of food and nutrition security and, most importantly, in terms of the social and economic benefits. We thank the Ministry for their commitment and the support provided by Government and all honourable Members of this august Parliament. Just are few issues that I wish to highlight, I will go straight into some of the key issues that I raised in my foreword, the utilisation of funds. There was a significant increase in funds from 2017- 2018 to 2018-2019, about $20 million plus, but then when it comes to the utilisation of the budget, it was under-utilised, as well for various reasons. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Opposition! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir! MR. SPEAKER.- I am sorry to interrupt you, are we on the same page here?</p><h4>HON. I.B.

TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>2094</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 The Committee noted that Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit’s (FFIU) contribution towards building a stronger legal, institutional, operational and regulatory environment on AML/CFT in Fiji that addresses domestic risk of money laundering and complies with the minimum international standards. In its findings, the Committee noted that FFIU has Memorandums of Agreement in place with several local and international stakeholders which enabled them to exchange information regarding suspicious transactions or possible money laundering activities, gain direct access to FFIU database including second staff with FFIU. It further noted that in addition to scams, tax evasions were found to be the other top possible underlying criminal activity identified in the Suspicious Transactions Report. Sir, FFIU investigated cases where businesses had not lodged their income tax returns since 2006 and cases where business owners had not registered their business with FRCS. The Committee expressed its concerns on the increase in online scams, pyramid schemes by using mobile money wallets and international debit cards to facilitate various online scams in 2021 and 2022. Members of the Committee would like to urge the general public to be vigilant and ensure that they do not fall prey to malicious scams of such nature which would lead to losing their hard- earned money and savings. The Members feel that at present there are no coordinated approach to deal with scams and money laundering and that law enforcement agencies need to take action swiftly. A timely report to FFIU from financial institutions can assist in taking quick action. There is a lack of a single agency taking responsibility for ensuring that these scams are filtered out in its initial stages and exposed to the public. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the Director of FFIU and his team for being prompt in answering the various queries and questions raised by the Committee. Finally, I would like to thank our Committee Members who are part of the team that produced this Report - Deputy Chairperson, honourable Sashi Kiran; honourable Tomasi Tunabuna, honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Semi Koroilavesau. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I submit the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit Annual Reports to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. S. TUBUNA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

BAINIVALU.– Mr. Speaker, this morning, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the National Fire</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2095 Authority Annual Report for the seven-month period ended 31 st July, 2016. This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Orders 109(2)(b) which mandates the Committee to look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media. Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee on Social Affairs was referred the National Fire Authority Annual Report for the seven-month period ended 31 st July, 2016 on 17 th February, 2023. As per the normal process of report scrutiny, the Committee was mandated by Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings. The Standing Committee would like to commend the work carried out by the National Fire Authority (NFA) in responding to emergencies and being able to perform to its level best. In addition, Mr. Speaker, NFA ensured the effective and efficient provision of fire rescue and emergency services whilst pursuing the completion of its capital projects which are the Korovou, Korolevu, Seaqaqa, Taveuni and Savusavu Fire Stations. Mr. Speaker, TC Winston devastated most parts of the country during that year. This did not deter NFA from playing its key role but continued to assist the emergency partners in providing timely assistance to the National Disaster Management Office. Mr. Speaker, it is also commendable to note that Government continues to support NFA through capital grants for expansion of its essential services to every community in both the urban and the rural centres. To see firsthand and witness the operation of one of the essential services, the Committee undertook a site visit to three fire stations namely, Korovou, Levuka and Korolevu. The Committee held talanoa sessions with officers of the three fire stations and compiled its findings and also sought clarifications that assisted the Committee to make its recommendations. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for putting the Report together - honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Parveen Bala and honourable Viam Pillay for their invaluable input and support. I would also extend my deepest appreciation to honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Penioni Ravunawa, as Alternate Members of the Committee on several occasions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also extend my gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer of the National Fire Authority, Mr. Sowane Puamau, and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and request all honourable Members to take note of the Report. (Report handed to Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- May I remind honourable Members to, please, switch off all cell phones when in Chambers. HON. A. V. B. C.

Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report. The Standing Committee on Social Affairs was referred the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report on 27 th March, 2023. As per the process for report scrutiny, the Committee was mandated by Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through its findings, the Committee commends the work performed by the Public Rental Board (PRB) for the year 2020. It was noted that for the year ending 31 st July, 2020, the PRB recorded an operating profit of $1.5 million in its revenue collection. The PRB has recorded profits in its books, despite the economic crises that significantly impacted on its business. Although it was a difficult year as the global pandemic reached our shores, this did not deter PRB in achieving its mandate which was set 33 years ago, to provide affordable rental accommodation to low income earners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PRB is evolving and modifying its products and services to adapt to the changing environment. It continues to provide affordable and accessible housing to all Fijians, for instance, upgrading of facilities in Kalabu and on Kia Street, Raiwai, in the Central Division, as well as the development of the three-storey building in Simla, Lautoka, in the Western Division. Sir, new projects for the PRB include Namelimeli in Navua and Waitovu in Ovalau, which are still in the approval process. The Standing Committee witnessed firsthand the work of PRB and its mandate to develop affordable and low-cost housing for Fijians, despite the challenge of capital funding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a new initiative that is still under the proposal phase is the Rent to Own Home Scheme. This Scheme will assist interested first home buyers in owning properties and will assist PRB tenants to graduate from being a tenant to a homeowner. Although the annual review was for 2020, the Committee acknowledged the current data and information provided by the stakeholders. This assisted the Committee in its review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, commend the work that is carried being out by PRB and extend my deepest gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Timoci Naleba, and his staff, for their timely assistance in this review process. I would also like to thank the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs – honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Parveen Bala and honourable Viam Pillay, for their valuable input and support in the compilation of this Committee Report. I also extend my deepest appreciation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to honourable Ketan Lal, who was an Alternate Member on certain occasions. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and request all honourable Members to take note of the Report. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2097 A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future Sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
