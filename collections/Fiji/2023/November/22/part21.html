BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Fiji National Sports Council 2017- 2018 Annual Report, which was tabled on 11 th September, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the Fiji Sports Council is responsible for planning, constructing, maintaining and delivering high quality venues and facilities for sports at all levels from high performance athletes to community recreational activities. The Council has more than delivered on its promise with the official opening of its head office</p><div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div><p>2182 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 and FMF gymnasium complex in January of 2018. The Fiji Sports Council emphasises the social and economic importance of sports in Fiji through modern sporting facilities that are now beginning to be established around the country particularly in rural areas. Through key investments and support from government more young people are beginning to see sports as a serious career path. Mr. Speaker, the Committee noted that there were achievements in the 2017 – 2018 financial year, the most memorable one which has the greatest long term impact was the commissioning of the new Fiji Sports Council head office and the reopening of the refurbished FMF gymnasium. Further to this, Government supported redevelopment of the Vodafone Arena which began in March of 2018. Following the renovations, the Vodafone Arena is the first venue in Fiji to assist Weightlifting Fiji the International Weightlifting Federation (World Junior Championships). It was also noted that netball Fiji had also won the bid to host the World Youth Championship in 2022 however, this did not eventuate due to COVID-19. in hosting Mr. Speaker, the refurbished facilities of the Fiji National Sports Council has contributed to the health and wellbeing of all Fijians by providing venues and facilities for sport and active recreational activities that bring people from all walks of life together. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. HON. P. K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Empty drum makes the loudest noise and I hope the message reaches to the respective speakers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sports Commission and Ministry of Youth work together, they connect to each other. So that is why I thought that I will clarify, on the National Youth Council and on the National Youth Policy. On the National Youth Council, this was the initiative of FijiFirst. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Never used it! (Honourable Members interject) HON. P. K. BALA.- We ran that Council, when the term expired, we did not appoint any members for the Council. The reason being... (Honourable Members interject) HON. P. K. BALA.- The reason was, what we decided at that time, that we need to go around the country, form youth clubs...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Still going around:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> … and then appoint the National Youth Council.</p><p>(Honourable Members interject) HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hogwash! HON. P. K. BALA.- That was the whole idea. Consult people, listen to people! That is what we believed in! Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Honourable Members interject)</p><div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 2183</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- Eight years:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> And on the, not eight years, it was only last year, you go and get your facts right, yaar! (Laughter) Sometimes I do not expect such things from you my brother. On the National Youth Policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the works were carried out in regard to the National Youth Policy. There were stakeholders who were involved in preparing this National Youth Policy and we were on the verge of presenting to Cabinet, but at that point in time, the FijiFirst Government felt that this is not the right time to present. More time is needed. (Honourable Members interject) HON. P. K. BALA.- More time is needed to go around and consult some other stakeholders and then bring it. That is where the story ended. It is not that we were roaming around, it is not that were not doing anything. (Honourable Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>(Honourable Members interject).- Overseas. HON. P. K. BALA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute on the review of the Fiji Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report. Sir, I will be very brief and straight to the point. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Sports Council was established in 1978 by the Act of Parliament, and I am sorry to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through my observation and research, that from 1978 to 2008, there was no or very little works carried out, in particular, capital works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the game changer began from 2007 and onwards at the Fiji Sports Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank and acknowledge the work of the former CEO, Litiana. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Litiana’s contribution to the Fiji Sports Council has been outstanding, and I wish her very well in her future endeavours. Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will inform this House what is happening at the Fiji Sports Council right now. They have been talking about accountability, they have been talking about transparency and under the leadership of my good friend, from the West. (Laughter) These things are happening. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to bring to the attention of this Parliament, on the award of the project work, one of the Australian Companies for the supply and installation and commissioning of full track works by the Fiji Sports Council which was definitely approved by the new Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wish to know whether this is the same company that was involved in a case whereby an employee of Water Authority of Fiji received $500 from this company.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Come on man:</span></p><div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div><p>2184 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 HON. P. K. BALA.- What do you mean ‘come on’, who are you? (Laughter) You keep shut. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this is the same company, then how and why this contract was given knowing very well that the Government financial policy does not allow to engage any contractor or firm who are involved in bribery. I hope Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister, my good friend from West will table a report in regard to this after proper and thorough investigation into this. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. P. K. BALA.- Not only that Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very reliably informed that the vehicles have been bought, staff salaries have been increased without the Board’s approval. (Honourable Members interject) HON. P. K. BALA.- Please, check on this, I think this is enough for my good friend, honourable Minister for Youth and Sports and I want to thank the Chairperson of the Committee and the Committee Members for the work that they have been carrying out in regards to the Fiji Sports Council. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the former Minister for Youth and Sports for his contribution this evening. It is another story like the municipal council. (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- Do you want me to open my mouth? (Laughter) HON. J. SAUKURU.- In the last six financial years, Fiji Sports Council has received around $8.3 million as grant assistance to support its operational activities which include the payment of properties, insurance and utilities for all its sports facilities. In the 2023-2024 financial year the funding of $670,000 is allocated to finance the principal loan payment to ANZ for the refurbishment of the Vodafone Arena. The Fiji Sports Council currently maintains 18 sporting properties on behalf of the Government. The list is as follows: (1) HFC Bank Stadium; (2) Vodafone Arena; (3) FMF Gymnasium; (4) National Fitness Centre; (5) Damodar City Aquatic Centre; (6) National Netball Centre; (7) National Hockey Centre; (8) National Beach Court; (9) Multipurpose Court; (10) National Sailing Centre; (11) Victoria Tennis Courts; (12) Narauyaba Sports Ground in Ra; (13) Lawaqa Park;</p><div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 2185 (14) Veivadravadra in Sigatoka; (15) Lautoka Regional Tennis Courts; (16) Stanley Brown Boxing Gym; (17) Suva Lawn Tennis Courts; and (18) Thompson Park. To date some of the major sporting development projects attained by the Fiji Sports Council include: (1) 2018 - the upgrade of the FMF Gymnasium; (2) 2019 - the upgrade of the Vodafone Arena; (3) 2023 - the upgrade of the National Hockey Centre; (4) 2023 - the upgrade of the Damodar City Aquatic Centre; (5) 2023 - upgrade of the Lautoka Regional Tennis Courts; and (6) 2023 - upgrade of the Narauyaba Sports Ground previously known as Ra Sports Ground. The HFC Stadium, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continues to be a key premier venue for various sporting events and social gatherings. Currently, the Fiji Sports Council is focused on: (1) Upgrading the HFC Stadium with synthetic tracks and this should be completed by early next year. I know a lot of sporting bodies have been wanting to use the National Stadium but the tracks are in a very bad state and we need to work on it now and dependent on the weather, we need to complete this before the start of school next year. As you know our students always look up to their athletics meet. (2) The construction of the multistorey complex with indoor food sell courts, it is a joint venture with Unit Trust of Fiji. (3) The renovation of National Hockey Centre and the Damodar City Aquatic Centre; works on both projects have been completed and it is now ready to be officially opened. Additionally, the Fiji Sports Council has put in place the following internal control measures to strengthen accountability and transparency processes in the utilisation of funds: (1) Conduct regular boards of survey for outdated equipment; (2) Updating current Finance Manuals and Procurement plans; and (3) Implementation of new ERP system to reduce manual manipulation with the strict approval processes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I respond to the former Minister for Youth and Sports, request, yes, I will be tabling a report later on the contract for the replacement of this synthetic tracks. Thank you very much. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution towards the motion that is before. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Chairperson and honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the preparation of the Committee Report and not forgetting the former CEO - Ms Litiana Loabuka and her dedicated team for the overall upkeeping of the Fiji Sports Council venues in previous years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the establishment of the Fiji Sports Council in1978, it continues to play an important role in our nation by providing safe and reliable sports facilities, foster and promote</p><div><a name="98">Page 98</a></div><p>2186 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 the development of sports and associated educational activities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a former Member of the Committee which deliberated on the Review Annual Report, I wish to speak on one of the findings highlighted by the Committee, that is the non- financially viable of seven venues, namely the Victoria Tennis Courts, the Damodar City Aquatic Centre, National Beach Courts, Veivadravadra Grass Sports Ground, National Sailing Centre and the Lawaqa Park. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee went on to recommend that the Council should build and enhance its participation on public private partnership for proper execution of sporting development projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although this might be an outdated report it is important that the Fiji Sports Council consider the recommendation put forward by the Committee and ensure that it is implemented accordingly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the public private partnership, the private sector institution will involve in financing the Fiji Sports Council venues upfront and in return draw revenues from users of the venues over the cost of the public private partnership contract. To attract the private sector and economic feasibilities assessment must be conducted to determine the cost and projected revenue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Sports Council should also consider engaging local communities by forming some sort of partnership with the Provincial Council, youth groups and sports clubs. This will allow the local community to take ownership and involve in the upkeeping of the venues and will reduce the operational cost for this non-financially viable properties. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this form of partnership is proven to be successful in most rural schools. Often tournament organisers or sports clubs wishing to host the tournaments, face challenges with the rates when hiring the Fiji Sports Council venues. Perhaps, this type of partnership, local youth groups and sports clubs can contribute towards the general operation of the venues and in return, be granted concessional rates when hiring one of the 7 non-financially viable venues. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the review of the Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report. First of all, I would like to join our honourable Minister for Youth and Sports in wishing our Team Fiji in the bid for gold in the Pacific Games in Honiara. As of now, I think 15 hours ago, we had three silvers and two bronze. Hopefully we will work on getting some more. The Fiji Sports Council, as we heard, was established in 1978 to encourage and promote the development of sports and recreational activities in Fiji. Just a side comment, we observe how honourable Members on the opposite side all seem to claim that everything in Fiji is their doing. I am not sure if they realise it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. R. DITOKA.- How un-Fijian that sounds:</span> In our traditional Fijian way, usually frowned upon when one blows one’s own trumpet. Usually, we allow others to give us recognition. I believe it is a universal concept, not only in Fiji, who think like that, it is bad form to be praising ourselves what we achieve. But our honourable colleagues in the Opposition, need to be reminded to tone down on the boastfulness.</p><div><a name="99">Page 99</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 2187 Just from this one point, Fiji Sports Council was established in 1978. We see the vast majority, not all of the developments in Fiji had their origin in administrations and governments of the past. It is not a thing to be ashamed of. You did not inherit a blank page. Fiji already had vertical and horizontal infrastructure, complex communication systems, television stations, regional and local universities, technical institutes, home to many regional and international organisations and NGOs, national plans to keep improving ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Speak on the report:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. R. DITOKA.- It is the way of the world that we live in. We do what we can and we hand it over to those who carry on the race:</span> When the time comes for us to do the same, we will hand over as well. We will let history judge us, therefore, what your protestations and claims, however loud, history will be our judge. It is futile to try and change that for as many teachers that have counselled their students, you will write your own report and for 16 years, you wrote your own report. That is why you are sitting on that side, and we are on this side. We have no problems nor difficulty in acknowledging your government’s developments that are worth your praise. But I ask this question in this august House, have you ever heard them acknowledge the previous administrations or governments? All I heard was unprecedented this, unprecedented that. Unfortunately, it is beyond the former government to thank anyone, it is not in their DNA. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, about two weeks ago the senior officials in our Ministry and I had a meeting with the Fiji Rugby Union where we discussed potential areas of collaboration. We discussed piggybacking on some of FRUs rugby development programmes as well as expertise in providing a network of administrators and officials at provincial, district and village level to support clubs, district teams as well as provincial teams. From the rural and maritime development point of view, this would help alleviate the rural- urban drift, provide training opportunities, help reduce NCDs, help with socio-economic development as well as provide career opportunities for some in professional rugby or netball. In the same way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that all sports have enormous potential to help in rural and national development, and I believe that the discussions that we had with FRU could also be something that we and other Ministries could be having with Fiji Sports Commission and those in the same field seeing that the Fiji Sports Council is responsible for all the planning, constructing, maintaining and delivering high quality values and activities for sports at all levels for high performance athletes to community recreational activities. As we go around Fiji, we see the deplorable state of some of our grounds in smaller communities and smaller towns, so it is something that is going to be challenging us and I suppose the challenge also for the Fiji Sports Council on what they can do. I congratulate the board and management of the Fiji Sports Council and wish them well for the future. I endorse, support, and commend the report. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their comments and constructive and some destructive contributions. (Chorus of interjections) Mr Speaker, I hope that in the near future, the Fiji National Sports Council and the Ministry of Youth and Sports will consider and assist in the building of a bigger sporting complex in Ra so in time</p><div><a name="100">Page 100</a></div><p>2188 Review Report–Fiji National Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report 22 nd Nov., 2023 we can also host some super 14 rugby matches. I have no further comments, Mr Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today and once again, I thank you all for your contributions. The Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 8.57 p.m.</p><div><a name="101">Page 101</a></div><p>i.</p></body>
