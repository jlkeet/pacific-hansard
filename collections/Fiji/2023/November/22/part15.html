<body><h3>OVERSEAS TRAVELLING ALLOWANCES – MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</h3><p>OVERSEAS TRAVELLING ALLOWANCES – MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to the honourable Prime Minister for his motion, in light of queries that have been raised with Parliament, I wish to provide some clarity on the Emoluments Committee process and as well as the motion that will be moved by the honourable Prime Minister. Before we proceed to that and pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023, the Emoluments Committee is still undertaking its assignment and will continue in existence until it completes its assignment as resolved by Parliament. As I had alluded to on Monday, 20 th November, 2023, the Emoluments Committee through the Chairperson, had informed the Committee that it would table its report at a later sitting in line with the resolution of 11 th September, 2023. With respect to the motion that will be moved by the honourable Prime Minister, this was unanimously agreed to by the Business Committee. The motion as listed on the Order Paper has been moved pursuant to section 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 and to provide further clarity, the honourable Prime Minister will move the motion to reduce the allowances given that under his ministerial assignments. Parliament business and the Parliamentary Remunerations Act of 2014 fall under his portfolio.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2143 For the information of honourable Members, sections 3, 9, 12 and 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 provide the means for determining the remuneration, inclusive of salaries, allowances and benefits for His Excellency the President, Prime Minister, other Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition, the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and Members of Parliament. The next motion by the honourable Prime Minister can be undertaken simultaneously and this is further emphasised in the honourable Minister’s motion whereby the amendment to take effect from 1 st December, 2023, until such time that the Emoluments Committee tables its report in Parliament and the subsequent debate and vote on the Committee’s Report has to take place. I hope that clarifies the issue. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, I move: (a) That pursuant to section 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014, Parliament makes a determination to reduce the rates payable for Overseas Travelling Allowances of the following positions by amendments to Part B of the Schedule to the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014, as set out below – (i) Prime Minister “9. Overseas Travelling Allowance – UNDP subsistence allowance plus 100 percent.” (ii) Cabinet Ministers “8. Overseas Travelling Allowance - UNDP subsistence allowance plus 50 percent.” (iii) Assistant Ministers “8. Overseas Travelling Allowance - UNDP subsistence allowance plus 25 percent.” (iv) Leader of the Opposition “8. Overseas Travelling Allowance - UNDP subsistence allowance plus 50 percent.” (v) Members of Parliament (including Deputy Speaker, Government/Opposition Whip and Leader of the Government in Parliament and excluding the Prime Minister, Ministers, Speaker and the Leader of Opposition) “6. Overseas Travelling Allowance – UNDP subsistence allowance plus 25 percent;” and (b) That this amendment to the Determination to take effect from 1st December, 2023 until such time that the Emoluments Committee tables its report in Parliament and the subsequent debate and vote has taken place. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion by the honourable Prime Minister. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you had pointed out prior to the moving of this motion, this motion in my name in today’s Order Paper is for the reduction of travel allowances for Members of Cabinet, Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>2144 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023 Before I go into it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I add my words of congratulation to our sportsmen and sportswomen in the Solomons at this time and also our words of condolences to those that had represented Fiji, particularly the Late Sitiveni Moceidreke and the Vanua o Vuda. I have a granddaughter playing in the South Pacific Games and I sent out my greetings to them, having been the Captain of the Fiji Team at the Pacific Games and also at the Commonwealth Games. I believe they are enjoying themselves but working very hard to get back up the medal scale. Mr. Speaker, Sir, salary and allowances in the public sector were somewhat distorted by the previous Government and it was our policy to review this for parity and relativity. Prior to the Promulgation of the Parliamentary Remuneration Act 2014, the salaries of the interim Cabinet Ministers stayed secret and paid through a private accounting firm, despite being the subject of audit query. Soon after assuming office in December last year, I announced my intention for the reduction of exorbitant ministerial salaries and travel allowances. Unfortunately, that was not operationalised, because of some legal opinions that came to us, and probably to you too. Therefore, this motion is being tabled today to put in place the reductions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government as an employer, has a legal obligation to ensure its officials have sufficient funds to carry out their duties necessitated by travels. These are costs to the taxpayers and the host organisations that engage our Government Ministers and officials. However, the current rates are still exorbitant. It is the responsibility of this Parliament under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act of 2014, to ensure that Ministers and officials on duty travel stay in decent accommodation and are able to safely move from one point to the other to undertake their engagements. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the requirements arising from the nature of engagements may differ from official to official, depending upon their seniority and responsibility. These costs vary between countries and within countries. For instance, the cost in Canberra would be different from the costs in Brisbane. However, the current formula put in place by the past government for calculating these allowances are excessive. This motion seeks to correct that anomaly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formula before this august Parliament today significantly reduces the daily allowance while remaining adequate for the officials concerned. The starting point for the calculation of the allowances in Fiji has been pegged at the UNDP Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) rates. The UNDP DSA rates are updated and published every quarter and are reliable. It is the standard used by almost all countries in calculating the travel allowances for Ministers and the officials. For Fiji and other countries, the extra loading for Members of Cabinet, Members of Parliament and Permanent Secretaries is to facilitate additional meetings that may be held. The extra loading also covers for representational events where these officials are hosting their counterparts. However, the formula for the increase made in 2016, despite the devastations of severe TC Winston, was excessive and sad to say, ill-advised. In comparison to the previous administration led by late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the late Laisenia Qarase and the SVT Coalition of the 1990s, the 2016 increases were exorbitant. This motion is intended to rectify the anomaly in travel allowances brought about in 2016. Under the proposed formula, for example, the Prime Minister’s DSA for Auckland, New Zealand is reduced from $2,826 to $1,590. Similarly for the Ministers, the new formula will reduce their DSA for Auckland from $2,090 to $954. This is the same DSA for the honourable Leader of the Opposition. For Assistant Ministers, the allowance declined from $1,572 to $759. This is the same DSA for the Opposition Members of</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2145 Parliament. The new formula will apply to all destinations for consistency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the exorbitant salaries of Cabinet and in public sector are also areas of concern to taxpayers and we read about them in the social media everyday. It is also our policy to review and correct the severe distortion of salaries and allowances in the public sector and restore parity and relativity. It is, therefore, appropriate that if the Emoluments Committee of Parliament has been established and now carrying out its work with the assistance of an independent consultant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Parliament agrees these revised travel allowances will be effective from 1 st December, 2023 until the Emoluments Committee completes its work and reports back to this august Parliament. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before offering the floor, I have with me a list provided by the Whips: (1) Honourable Leader of the Opposition; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (3) Honourable J. Usamate; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute in the debate on the motion before Parliament. Again, we want to say to the Government that you are the government, you call the shots. It is your prerogative as you regularly quote in your responses to most of the interviews that you have been having but we have a few questions: (1) What is the objective? (2) What are the reasons behind this? (3) Are they merely political or is it a question of availability of funds? (4) As the previous Opposition used to say, there is no money or where is the money? It leaves us confused because on 12th July, we had already agreed and you had alluded to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that pursuant to Standing Order 129 that the Emoluments Committee be established to review the salaries and allowances. Again, on 1st August, the submission because they were not able to submit, and we understand that the work is still going on and we are represented in the Committee by the honourable Whip and honourable Mosese Bulitavu and are well aware of the discussions that are taking place in the Emoluments Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So where do we stand? The question that we will ask is this, this is going to be effective from 1st December and when the work of the Emoluments Committee is completed next year and submitted and it is contrary to what we are going to agree on today, what will be our position because we have given the mandate to the Emoluments Committee and now, the honourable Prime Minister is coming up with a motion on the determination of allowances of the positions already highlighted, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Then the question of timing, why now, not earlier. Is this just to satisfy the honourable Minister of Finance who has been talking about this in the interviews that he has been having lately with Vijay Narayan? So is the Minister of Finance, again, like he did previously, forcing the honourable Prime Minister to come up with this motion? ‘ (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2146 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023 MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Who is really in charge, Mr. Speaker, Sir - the honourable Prime Minister or the honourable Deputy Prime Minister? (Laughter) If I may use one of the favourite lines of the honourable Nawaikula as you are all aware, “Mr. Prime Minister, sack your Finance Minister.” (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has been telling Vijay Narayan in all the interviews that he is going to come up with a motion to reduce this, but why not earlier, why not in January, why not in the first hundred days? You have made full use of what was available, you have milked it dry and now you come into this House so that you can look good politically while the Report of the Emoluments Committee is still pending – you want to reduce this. It is illogical, it does not make sense. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us stand on principles. The former Leader of the Government in Parliament is behind you, she is in charge of the Emoluments Committee, and she is doing all her best in trying. The current Leader of the Government in Parliament is also in the Emoluments Committee, Mr Speaker, Sir. Do you have faith and trust in the work that they are doing, or shall we just disband the Emoluments Committee because they are ineffective and inefficient? (Laughter) Anyway, where do we stand? It is the question of timing as well, Mr Speaker Sir. I am well aware of section 13, that is, on the determination of a few of the positions but at the same time, Sir, particularly section 6, the principles to be applied when setting allowances and benefits. You have always talked about Parliamentary processes, listening and consulting that is the process but now you want to short circuit it again. Section 6 of the Remunerations Act of Parliament 2014, when setting the remuneration to be prescribed the determination that it lays to allowances and benefits Parliament must also have regards to the following principles but the allowances and benefits shall be determined in a way that recognizes the need of the public understanding of the work of those persons and in the case of Members, their parties and the services they require to enable them to carried out their roles and functions. Let me make it clear Mr Speaker, that we are not against this reduction. But as a matter of principles, we are arguing about the Committee that has been formed to look into this and they would have been a better position to go through the processes outlined the part 6 of the Act, Mr Speaker, Sir. As I’ve said you are the Government, you call the shots it is your prerogative, we are not against it because in terms of fairness as well it takes into consideration the need to be fair to the taxpayer. We are considerate of that, Mr Speaker, Sir. But, again, we have an Emoluments Committee, our decision, we will await the Emoluments Committee that we have already agreed to on 12 th July, 2023. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- That is a matter of principle because otherwise, again, this is a confused Government, this is a rudderless Government. Where do you stand? There is a lot of inconsistency in the things that you bring to the floor of Parliament.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2147</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministers are flip floppy:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> This is what I am trying to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is excessive …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes it is:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> … the process is there and of course 17 as well allows for this to be reviewed. I will not go into it, honourable Deputy Prime Minister …. (Hon. M. S. N. Kamikamica interjects) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- You are one of the Ministers who benefited a lot. You had been globetrotting in the last few months, that is why you cannot fix these stalls on the roadside because you spent too much time overseas, not here in Fiji. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- You have milked the system dry and then you want to come to Parliament and want to reduce it. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sit down! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Logic. Again, he is the Prime Minister of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are aware of the UNDP allowance, we are aware of the subsistence allowance but there is a reason behind this incidental allowance. This is not only for the honourable Prime Minster, but also for everyone. Again, I have talked about us punching above our own weight, we need to be relevant in the global world, we need to be well represented, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Diplomacy, the art of diplomacy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not only the work of our diplomats, it is no longer the case now in this modern world. We, as Ministers we are an extension arm of diplomacy. There are issues that needs to be socialised. They do this well in the private sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because they have the funds. That is why they have all these functions, that is the art of diplomacy at work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last IPU meeting, Fiji has been given the chairmanship of Small Island States in IPU. We have to meet the honourable Speaker from the Seychelles and the Deputy Chair as well; I have forgotten the name of the country. It was meeting over lunch, we have to pay for it, that is why the incidentals are there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is not everyday:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> $200, $300 for a Minister, a meal in New York, take five people, otherwise we are just …. (Laughter) Diplomacy, Sir. It is there for a reason. We all live in a benefit-oriented society but again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister talked about what was there previously but what came into effect in 2014, let me put it into perspective. While salaries and allowances were increased</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>2148 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023 although exorbitant as you may say, but we took away most of the other benefits as well; medical benefits, insurance benefits, housing benefits …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- That was a disaster:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> … tax free whatever for a vehicle during a term. So, you are just given the salary …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You did not consult:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> … and then you look after all your other expenses from the salary and allowances that you are given.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That was a disaster:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- So it was balancing of the expenses and the income that you are getting:</span> That was the logic behind it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Again, we are not against it, but as a matter of principle, we await the work of the Emoluments Committee as we agreed to on the 12 th July and when that report comes into this Parliament, we will then debate and make the right decisions accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is my contribution. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes I really feel for the other side of Parliament. I think if they look in the mirror, Sir, they will not like what they see.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- But we feel for you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> The honourable Leader of the Opposition is a good orator, I have to give him that much. He is a great orator maybe because he is from the same province as I, but he was struggling today for fresh air and I will explain why. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been in the private sector for 30-plus years.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Disaster:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I have never in my life seen the type of allowances that were paid to that side of Parliament; I have never seen it. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the private sector, the allowances of the UN are regarded the highest. So, we actually go below the United Nations allowance. We find out what the real cost is to the companies and then we will work out. These allowances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were absolutely excessive and it is funny now that we have actually been visiting, some of the things that the honourable Leader of the Opposition was saying about entertaining or whatever, most of the time when they go on these trips, they get entertained. They never spend any money anywhere. It very rarely happens. It is a nonsense to suggest that you are going around with 300 percent a day or 200 percent a day to actually go and entertain somewhere else. That probably happens only once or twice in that whole week or whatever when you are away. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the big reasons why we are so concerned on this side of Parliament was the excessive nature of these allowances. It is too much. In fact, I was not going to say it, but I am going to say it. They were making money on the allowance. That side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker,</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2149 Sir, were making money on of the allowances. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. BIA.:</span> Enjoying it for the last 10 months.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> So, they sit here and claim about the allowances. The reality is that they were making money on the allowances. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to address the question about me making money on allowances. I will share this just so that everyone knows. As soon as I got into office, I reduced my allowance to 100 percent...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Grace Road:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> … out of principle, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I just share that for him to know. Some of the other honourable Ministers did the same because we just felt that it was almost like thievery of the people of Fiji. It is almost like stealing from the people of Fiji, that was how excessive it was. This load, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are a waste of taxpayer’s money. That is one of the main reasons we are actually through with the honourable Prime Minister in deciding to reduce the allowances. I agree, it should have been done a long time ago which brings me to my second point. Mr. Speaker, as soon as we got into office, we started talking about how to reduce these allowances. We ended up having a Cabinet decision in April, I believe. Sir, we formally decided on it and then we were told, “oh no, it has to go through the Emoluments Committee”. And then we say, “okay”. Remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the first time in Government for a lot of us. We actually allowed the Emoluments Committee to operate and then we felt that we needed to do it because it just taking too long. It was absolutely taking too long. We made a decision in April and now we are going to wait for the Emoluments Committee until next year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we felt, maybe we are deviating from due process but who is benefitting? The people of Fiji are benefiting by us putting money back into the coffers for greater use for the bubbly good of Fiji. So, that is why we are doing it. We are not doing it because of any press release or because of honourable Biman Prasad. We are doing it because we had made a decision in April and we felt it was taking too long. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just thought that I clarify that so that that side of Parliament would know. When they look in the mirror, Sir, they will see what we are seeing. The final point to make Mr. Speaker, Sir, is we had a promise that we had made to the people of Fiji about these allowances. If you look at the way we have been operating since we started, we are keeping up with our promises to the people of Fiji. The honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs just talked about the GCC coming back. The honourable Minister for Employment talked about the reforms that we are going to do in industrial relations that would put us back in a position where we really become a true democracy in our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third reason and the obvious one, we had made a promise to the people of Fiji like all the other things we are doing to deliver on that promise, we are delivering on that promise here today and besides, that side of Parliament was enjoying these allowances for eight years or 16 years...</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>2150 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- And you are just one year now:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> …because they were keeping it as a secret in terms of hiding the books from the people of Fiji. Maybe it was for 16 years. So: the allowances are excessive and need to go; • • we were just following process and the process was taking too long; and • we are keeping our promises to the people of Fiji. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not heard so much drivel and hogwash in such a long time. I think the honourable Prime Minister has spoken at length about why these allowances are in place in the first place. He has expressed his feelings; he thinks that it is too much. The honourable Leader of the Opposition has also spoken about why these things are put there in the first place. When our Prime Minister and Ministers go out, they carry the status of their positions with them. They represent Fiji, they need to be able to demonstrate Fiji in good stand, they need to live in a nice place that has a good representation of Fiji. They must be able to do the kind of things diplomatically that we had talked about, not only in the meetings but outside of the meetings that allow them to get the results. This morning when we heard the Ministerial Statement from the honourable Prime Minister, we saw the impact of good visits, where they make visits that bring good kinds of results. In order to do that, whenever Cabinet Ministers or Prime Minister goes, they need to carry themselves well because they reflect Fiji, and it is important that they represent Fiji well so that they can deliver good service for us. As the honourable Leader of the Opposition says, a lot of the business that takes place, it takes place on the margins, not only in the meetings themselves. I hope that the people travelling to these meetings they actually go and say something, and they participate in all the side events and they try to create for themselves programmes where they go and meet people, have coffee, buy some lunch for someone to get some actual benefit out of it because that is where a lot of benefits come from. Benefits in the meeting but then there are things that you do outside and over and above that, the personal relationships that you create over time by meeting people, buying them coffee, buying them dinner, that is why all these allowances were there. I know some Ministers are probably just going to the meeting, they travel thousands of miles, they go there, they do not even make a statement, they do not go to any event, and they just come back, I hope that that is not happening. That is what it is meant for.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Do not lie:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- That is why all these things are important. That is what is reflected in the allowances that they make:</span> As the honourable Leader of the Opposition had said, when all the benefits have been put into the salaries, that means a lot of the other benefits that were there for Ministers, Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament were removed. It all became just the salary itself. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister said that they had to take this step because it was too slow. It is too slow because you were too slow. Everything that you do is too slow. Your processes are not right, that is why it is too slow. If it was so important, you could have done it in April. Everything was too slow because you are probably blind, still trying to find your way around, you do not know what to do. Probably, the people who are advising you are giving you the wrong legal</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2151 advice, whoever those people were. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- What we are seeing here is a Government that does not follow the due processes that we have here in Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Responsible Government:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE- We have decided to have an Emoluments Committee and then you are shortcutting the Emoluments Committee:</span> If you want to shortcut the Emoluments Committee, why not do the whole hog - do the whole salaries, do everything else, do not just look at the travel allowance, do it all because that is what you seem to be doing. This is not new, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few years ago the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor Prasad used to be the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. This is the purpose of the Public Accounts Committee, you look at all these reports then you make your findings and your submission and you present it to Parliament where it is discussed. But during that time, what he would as the Chairman, he would give off the cuff interviews to the press telling them what is actually happening when his focus as a Public Accounts Committee was to do the discussions and bring it to Parliament. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- He was trying to shortcut the processes of Parliament and that is what he is doing again now. We have set up the Emoluments Committee to do this job and you are trying to shortcut it. The same thing that was done in the Public Accounts Committee, he is doing it again. Once we set up a process, we need to abide by it. All the consultations have taken place in the Emoluments Committee. We have presented, I was part of the team from FijiFirst that presented there, other parties must have presented, we brought in a third party consultant. I think the report should be, if I am not mistaken, towards the end of this year. Hopefully the report should be ready, it should come out early next year. Why can we just not complete that particular process? As the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, I think what you are trying to do is trying to create a false political image of yourselves. This is a political gimmick, that is all what this is. The process is just about to go, to finish and then you bring this in. There is absolutely no bases upon which to do this. We do not agree with what you are proposing here, we believe that we need to go through the Emoluments Committee, let them produce the report and complete the process as it should be done. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for afternoon tea and when we return, I will offer the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. The Parliament adjourned at 4.38 p.m.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>2152 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 22 nd Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 5.17 p.m. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to fully endorse the motion tabled by the honourable Prime Minister and the Head of our Coalition Government. Let me also confirm that this motion is not only a knee jerk reaction to public concerns about travel expenditure, but as valid as the concerns that have been for almost 11 months, and were indeed so for more than six years since 29 th September, 2016 up to 14 th December, 2022 when the FijiFirst Government was in power. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can understand why the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Usamate would oppose this motion, and they camouflaged their Opposition to some kind of dubious argument about process. HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Very dubious argument about process. Let me remind them because some of them were part of that. When the Standing Committee on Public Accounts under my chairmanship, at that time the Opposition was chairing the Public Accounts Committee, came to a point where we demanded the secret salaries payment and the terms and conditions on which it was determined to be brought before the Public Accounts Committee, thereafter, I was sacked through an amendment to the Standing Order in this Parliament. All of them were sitting there supporting it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Dictatorial:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they talk about process. On 3 rd October, 2014, three days before the new Parliament was supposed to sit, the Interim Government in which their leaders were part of brought a decree and determined for themselves for the Opposition the salaries and pays that they were getting after knowing that they had won the elections and were going to sit on the Government side. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- What processes are they talking about? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hypocrisy!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- You are going against your own Prime Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the hypocrisy:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hypocrisy that side:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You know that is coming from them. We know Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, that it has taken the People’s Coalition Government nine months to bring this motion to the floor of this Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Degrading:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> The honourable Prime Minister quite clearly explained why and despite that, despite the fact that all Members of Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, continued to endure a 20 percent salary cut, first imposed as a restorative measure from April 2020 by the former government and we know that our critics have generally demanded for a reduction in the overseas travel allowances. We do not blame them Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are speaking out because we have given them</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>22 nd Nov., 2023 Overseas Travelling Allowances-Members of Parliament 2153 the full freedom to do so. We also do not blame them Mr. Speaker, Sir, for not talking about these things before because they were afraid, there was a fear of being victimised, harassed, intimidated by the former government. We have abundance of examples of that kind of victimisation, harassment and intimidation from 2014 to 2022. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Say it loud! Loud! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Because they are confused, they do not support the reduction because they were part of the loot of the increase in the allowances for that many years and they are actually confused. So, they are camouflaging and say ‘Oh, this is a political thing.’ Mr. Speaker, Sir, you were not in Parliament and due to two years of unfair suspension from May 2015 when the overseas travel allowances skyrocketed because at that time an overwhelming majority of 50 Members of Parliament who occupied this august Chamber decided to vote for ridiculously high allowances on 29 th September, 2016. Neither was the honourable Prime Minister and indeed many other honourable Members on both sides of this Chambers as part of our Coalition Government only honourable Deputy Prime Minister Viliame Gavoka, honourable Aseri Radrodro and I were back then sitting in the Opposition. The current Opposition which was back then the Government and in fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition when he was speaking, he actually … MR. SPEAKER.- Let me correct you, honourable Professor Biman Prasad, honourable Aseri Radrodro never agreed. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am saying, he was with us in the Opposition, that was what I said. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What I am saying is that at that time, there were only three of us sitting on the Opposition who are in Government at the moment, that is what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Myself, the honourable Minister for Education and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. HON. P. K. BALA.- The honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua, honourable Tikoduadua? (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I am talking about 2016.</p></body>
