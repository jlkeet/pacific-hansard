<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Survey/Study on Skills Shortage (Question No. 146/2023) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations inform Parliament whether the Ministry has undertaken any survey or study to ascertain which industry sectors are affected the most and consequently, whether any policy initiative has been put in place to address the skills shortages by the private sector? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the question asked by the honourable Alvick Maharaj and I thank him for the question. Addressing skills shortages requires multi- stakeholder approach involving collaboration among government, educational institutions, workers and employers’ organisations and the whole private sector to ensure that we get the most practical solution to the problems that exist within the industries. Mr. Speaker, the issue of skills gaps and labour mobility is a global issue, and a small economy like Fiji is hit the hardest due to our skilled workers being poached by bigger nations. This is an issue that I have profoundly discussed with the relevant stakeholders to ensure we come up with better policies and programmes. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has been working with stakeholders, like the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS) through Professor Hitendra Pillay of Queensland University of Technology and in the area of priority needs on training and development of the workforce. Professor Pillay and his team has prepared a comprehensive report on the priority areas where scholarships will be given in the next three to five years based on the labour market and industry demand. HON. K. K. LAL.- Why do you get overseas academics, do you not have academics here in Fiji? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a copy of this report is also with the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. We have already been in discussion with the Fiji Higher Education Commission, Ministry of Education, International Organisation for Migration, TSLS including our overseas development partners in working together to conduct an employment survey and skills gap and also explore new opportunities to strengthen our local institutions like National Training and Productivity Centre (NTPC). Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was invited to launch the TSLS Employer Connect Framework earlier this year. This Framework is to connect employers with students who are sponsored by TSLS and the recent graduates seeking employment. Sir, TSLS assured to launch an online portal to help employers connect with students, graduates seeking employment. The online portal is ready to be launched on 15 th December and go live. The Employer Connect Portal developed by the Tertiary Loans and Scholarship Service is a comprehensive job board. The key features of the Employer Connect Portal are as follows: (1) The job board for graduate and employers, graduates can register, create online resumes while employers can post job vacancies.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1953 (2) All registrations are automatically verified via FRCS TIN verification and integration. (3) Easy application process - the portal simplifies the application process making it easier for graduates to apply for jobs. (4) Efficient recruitment for employers can effortlessly shortlist candidates, scheduled interviews and hire suitable applicants. (5) Smart job matching - a sophisticated algorithm suggests the best job opportunities based on the applicant’s skills, ensuring a good match between the job requirement and the applicants’ capabilities. Insightful reporting module - the portal includes modules for analysing the job market, skills demand and scholarship trends adding in strategic decision making. (6) (7) User friendly interface with smart job cards, the easy navigation of the portal is designed to enhance user experience. (8) Notifications - users receive timely updates and notifications relevant to their job sets recruitment needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the framework not only assists graduates in securing employment opportunities but also expedites talent search for employers. Overall, the Employer Connect Portal by TSLS represents significant steps in connecting sponsored students with potential employers, supporting them throughout their educational and early professional journey.</p><h4>HON. K.K. LAL.- Ministerial Statement?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- I thank the TSLS leadership and the staff as well as the Fourth Year Software Engineering Students from USP who developed this:</span></p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministerial Statement.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Just wait, listen! As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has allowed over 13,000 sponsored students to work 20 hours a week by seeking approval. This is helping employers to some extent mitigate labour shortages. I thank the TSLS, again, for this initiative in helping the Government and the employers. I will soon be meeting with potential employers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to discuss the Apprenticeship Scheme, it is all about the job market. In consultation with the TSLS Board, the Apprenticeship Scheme is a way of mitigating labour shortage and Government has a plan to incentivise it. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Listen! How are we going to incentivise this? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hourly pay of the apprentices is $2.97. We are now offering the employers an incentive to top it up with $2, make it $4.97 or pay 50 percent of the school fee through TSLS. That is the incentive we are working on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I speak, the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation together with our Ministry with the assistance from the ILO is conducting its own survey of the job market including</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1954</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 debt of the SMEs and that is going to assist us further in determining the areas of need where we can then offer the short-term and medium term training programmes through all the institutions that are offering this programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also put on record in this reply the draconian laws that were imposed by the FijiFirst Government were the biggest hindrance... (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- …towards a collaborative approach in determining the shortage. Let me quantify Mr. Speaker, Sir. A good survey needs data and people who are in charge of doing good data for us are the Bureau of Statistics. The Chief Statistician was terminated by them for coming up with true data.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Flabbergasted:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Employment Relations and Labour has to work in compliance with ILO Conventions, an instrument that we are signatory to. They blatantly breached all the Conventions that they were signatories to including the fundamental one and they talk about labour market survey. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we are now complying with all those and we are doing everything through consultation. Now the tri-partisan is at its best, no longer distorted and we are consulting, discussing and dialoguing at every step on everything that we do. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The Minister has gone around the world... (Laughter)</p><h4>... and explained 50 percent of the question. One of the questions that has been asked and</h4><p>may I read “which industry sectors are affected the most?” He has not even elaborated on that. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you made a very thorough reply. HON A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the industries are affected. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- All the professions are affected:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- There is a shortage in every area, Sir. We have chased our people away just because of the way we treated them. Now, we are trying to retain and replace them. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker Sir, through you, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament:</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1955 (1) how much you have paid to that overseas consultant; and (2) when the survey will be completed and the report presented?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It is a new question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the survey has been completed and the report, I have just stated, is already with the Ministry of National Planning. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- No, towards the end of your statement, you said that the survey has been carried out. HON. A. D. SINGH.- At the expense of repeating Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the report has been completed and handed over, the copy is already with the Office of the Ministry of National Planning and it is being implemented. HON. P. K BALA.- Cost?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> The cost is a new question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K BALA.:</span> Clarification, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. HON. P. K BALA.:</span> A point of clarification, Sir. At the end of his Statement he mentioned that right now the Ministry of Employment, the private sector …. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> You’re not the Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K BALA.:</span> Can you answer? (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K BALA.- I am not asking you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, towards the end he said, and that is what I have asked, as to when will the survey be finished and the survey report will be presented - simple, that is what I am asking. What is so difficult, is it a new question? HON. A. D. SINGH.- What do you want? (Laughter) HON. P. K BALA.- (Inaudible) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, I could not get what he wants, if he wants a copy of the Report I will bring it over for him after lunch.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> That is not the point, Mr. Speaker Sir.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1956</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, it is very simple. During the end of his Statement, he said that … HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your point of order? HON. P. K. BALA.- … right now, his Ministry staff, the private sector and other stakeholders are carrying out a survey. What I have.… (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Can you shut up, man.</p><p>(Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.-… what I am asking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when will that survey be finished? That is all. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- I am not asking for the report that is lying in his office:</span></p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I will clarify that one Sir, with your permission.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- I am sorry:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The language used is not only unparliamentary but it is extremely unparliamentary:</span> He used the word “shut up” to another honourable Member. The word “shut up” should not be used in any Parliament and now I am asking him to withdraw “shut up”. HON. P. K. BALA.- I withdraw that, Mr. Speaker. I am kind enough to do that, but the fact remains the same. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move on, honourable Members. High Seas Treaty (BBNJ) - UNCLOS (Question No. 147/2023) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1957 Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the signing of the High Seas Treaty (BBNJ) under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to the honourable Prime Minister, an issue has been raised with my Office regarding this question and the amount of information that is going to be tabled if it is going to be thorough in the way he addresses the question. Again, it brings to mind the definition of classified information if there is such a thing as classified information under the Official Secrets Act or any other Act for that matter because the honourable Prime Minister is a bit worried as to the depth of the question and where it is heading because it might force him to divulge certain issues which are regarded as classified. But I leave that to the honourable Prime Minister for him to make that statement once more and we will leave it at that, honourable Members. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to Question No. 147 of 2023. But as you had pointed out, Sir, I have a lot of information which is useful for us in Parliament now and for those who will come after us. A lot of the substance contained in the response is of great national interest to national leaders all over the world, whether I present a summary and present and table the full response to the House, I will be led by your direction, Sir. Mr. Speaker Sir, Fiji has always played a very important role internationally and regionally advocating for our oceans and we have carried on this from the previous government and the governments before that. All the way back to 1992 when the world met in Rio for the first Earth Summit that developed into a series of Conferences of Parties (COP) from the following year up to this year. On 8 th September, Sir, Cabinet approved the signing of the BBNJ Treaty when it was opened for signing around the United Nations General Assembly in September. The Treaty was then tabled in Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. The Committee is still working on that and has not come back. However, when the Treaty was presented for signing, Fiji was one of the first to sign and have led to be ratified by this august Parliament. It was negotiated and adopted by the UN General Assembly as an Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it is of interest to us, and it will be of interest to those who will grace this Chamber in the years to come. For me, it was an honour to sign the Treaty at the signing ceremony on the margins of the United Nations Development Account (UNDA). Fiji was one of the first countries to sign the BBNJ Treaty, just as we were the first to sign the UNCLOS in Jamaica in 1982. To fast-track notifications of the Treaty to ensure entry into force as soon as possible, 60 countries must ratify the Treaty for it to come into force. As with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea our nation’s diplomat participated extensively in the negotiations for the Treaty which aims to better coordinate stakeholders in the protection of the areas beyond their national maritime boundaries called the High Seas Treaty (BBNJ). Fiji, through our former Ambassador to the United Nations, His Excellency Satya Nandan, led the complex negotiations throughout the 1970s that led to the adoption of the Law of the Sea on behalf of Pacific Island Countries at the time that the Pacific was not well represented in the United Nations and many Pacific Islands then were still colonies. Many countries strongly opposed the 200- mile economic zone throughout those long-drawn-out negotiations.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1958</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 The adoption of the UNCLOS was a mammoth step for Fiji and all Small Island States of the Pacific, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Law of the Sea effectively gave Pacific Island Countries the control of our respective 200-mile EEZ, which meant that Island Countries gained control of the fish and the seabed resources across our 200-mile zone as a result of the adoption of that historic Convention. Ambassador Satya Nandan went on to become the first Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority and retired after serving two consecutive terms. The Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty gives all the UN member States the opportunity to effectively conserve and sustainably manage the use of maritime resources in the high seas and we talk a lot about the protection and management of our marine resources, and this is where we are drawing that authority from. In turn, it will also help to protect marine resources within our national jurisdiction, contributing to a healthy marine environment and a stronger blue economy for the livelihoods of the people of Fiji. The High Seas Treaty is key to protecting the ocean, promote equity and fairness, tackle environmental degradation, fight climate change and prevent biodiversity loss in the high seas. The adoption of this BBNJ Treaty is a historic achievement marking the successful end of more than a decade of multilateral negotiations. Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDs) representatives, including Fiji, participated in the BBNJ Treaty negotiations with members sharing similar priorities and positions. The objective of the BBNJ Treaty is aligned with Fiji’s National Ocean Policy and other laws and policies. The general objective of BBNJ Treaty is to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond our national jurisdiction or any national jurisdiction for the present and in the long term through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of UNCLOS. The Treaty also provides a link between the climate change and the law of the city, a link that was not included in our UNCLOS as the impact of climate change on the marine environment was not widely studied at the time of its negotiation. The final text, Mr. Speaker, Sir, captured Fiji and PSID’s priorities, including our special circumstances as PSIDs, the role of traditional knowledge and indigenous people and local communities, fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from access to and utilisation of marine genetic resources from areas beyond national jurisdiction, as well as the need for capacity building and transfer of technology. The Leaders Communique issued at the PIF Leaders’ Summit in Nadi earlier this year, highlighted the need for the finalisation of the High Seas Treaty, given it will be instrumental in managing and protecting the region’s marine biodiversity. Following our signing of the Treaty and eventual ratification, after Parliamentary approval, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will conduct the necessary consultations with relevant line Ministries to ensure relevant laws and policies are amended to facilitate the implementation of the Treaty. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Prime Minister update Parliament as to the benefits of signing this BBNJ Treaty to Fiji? MR. SPEAKER.- I thought that has been well articulated by the honourable Prime Minister just a while ago. He dwelt at length on the BBNJ Treaty, especially with the ocean boundaries and the jurisdiction. Can we leave it at that, or do you still want to raise your question? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits that the Treaty will bring to Fiji? MR. SPEAKER.- This is interesting, you are raising a very interesting question regarding</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1959 Government’s foreign policies and the Honourable Prime Minister has given a reply to that effect, yet you are still after more. Perhaps if the …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> I withdraw my question, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Rinesh Sharma, a supplementary question. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister. I understand that collective action is required in moving this country forward, especially for the younger generations who are the future and the benefits that you have actually highlighted for this Treaty but Honourable Prime Minister, there is confusion in what terms is Fiji, a few months back, supported the Japan nuclear waste dump as well as … HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What is your question? HON. R. R. SHARMA.- … the coal industry in Australia. Now with this Treaty, you have spoken about climate change, this Treaty has a marine genetic resource mechanism component. So, can you please inform the august House by when will this materialise? MR. SPEAKER.- I think I will not allow that question given that the honourable Prime Minister has made statements already, he has even given apologies at the recent Forum Secretariat meeting in the Cook Islands. So, I suggest we leave it at that and let us continue. Clarification on the Inflation Level (Question No. 148/2023) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics clarify the inflation level, as the official CPI has been stated to be 4.2 percent in 2022 and below 2percent in 2023? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. This is an important question because I think there is a lot of misinformation, a lot of confusion with respect to how inflation is measured so I thank the honourable Member for the question. Mr. Speaker, the official average inflation released by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics in 2022 stood at 4.3 percent while the year and inflation for 2022 stood at 3.1 percent in December 2022. So Mr. Speaker, Sir, the average inflation from January to October is around 1.7 percent while the recent year on year inflation for October 2023 stood at 4 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the official numbers that have been released by the Bureau of Statistics which is the national office responsible for collecting and reporting statistics in Fiji but let me, Mr. Speaker, honourable Usamate will understand this because this would sound like Economics 101, but it is important for the people to understand these and the definition of inflation and how it is always being measured in Fiji. So, inflation, Sir, is the general increase in price of goods and services over a period of time and usually over a year. For example, the current 4.0 inflation rate in October 2023 means that consumer prices are four percent (4 percent) higher when compared to the year October 2022. That is what it means. A lot of people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, get this wrong because the percentage increase in price is compared to the same period a year before, not compared to two years ago or five</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1960</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 years ago compared to the 1970s because that would be completely wrong, and some people try and do that. They said, “Alright, the price was this three years ago or five years ago or ten years ago”. Furthermore, when we say, “average inflation for the year”, it means the average ‘year on year’, on inflation for 12 months. So, for policy purposes, we generally use the ‘year on year’ inflation and not the average. The other important point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, is that, inflation is measured by what we called the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is based on a representative basket of goods and services that is purchased by the consumer with different weights. Different items have different weights assigned to individual products and services based on its importance. Right now, with the Bureau of Statistics, for example, the CPI base that we are using now is the 2014 base and there are 349 items in that basket. They are categorised and I want to mention those. • Food and non-alcoholic beverages - 35 percent; • Alcohol, tobacco and narcotics - 10 percent; • Housing and utilities -13 percent; • Household furnishing, clothing, footwear - 7 percent; • Health and education - 9 percent; • Transport - 14 percent; and • Communication and others - 8 percent. For example, if the food price has gone up by 8.6 percent, if you look at year on year price rise, the weight is 35 percent. So, even a slight increase in the food items will show a much bigger inflation rate, Mr. Speaker. For example, hotels, the prices have gone up by 11.6 percent but the weight in the CPI basket for hotels and restaurants is only 2.98 percent. So, while the price rise is much bigger there, the inflation rate, if it is looked at in the basket, will be much lower. Mr. Speaker, the point that I also want to make is that a lot of people you know focussing on the budget. Yes, there are measures in the Budget. We had three rates of VAT - zero, nine and 15. We have kept the zero-rated VAT on all the 21 food items. So, there is no tax and no VAT increase on the 21 food items. Absolutely none! In fact, for some of them, we have reduced their duties. Mr. Speaker, I just got the list of food items, in particular, from the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC). The prices have gone down on 92 food items and there are a number of factors why the prices have gone down. One is that before COVID or during COVID, prices had gone up by quite a bit because freight costs had gone down. So, freight costs are also coming down and those 21 food items that have zero VAT and the freight cost has come down, their prices have also gone down. It is not as if all the products or all the different brands, but if you look at milk, for example, all the prices for the different brands of milk have actually gone down.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The quality as well:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> No, one or two in the quality but generally, Mr. Speaker, if they care to look at this public list, they will actually find that in some cases, the same quantity, the prices have gone down. I mean, I just wanted to make this point, and they do not talk about it, Sir,</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1961 that some of the prices have actually gone down. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to hear from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister that prices of 92 items have gone down because he has mentioned the list of 200, so we look forward to reading about that 200. The price of milk has gone down, and he forgot to mention that it used to be 500 grammes of milk, now it is 450 grammes, the price has gone down, the quantity has also gone down. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ANZ just produced a report suggesting that the projected inflation for this year might be 6 percent, but they say that that is understated, that it will be around 13 percent. Food manufacturers are saying that the production costs have gone up between 20 percent to 30 percent. So, given this, if the projection is 6 percent and it is actually 13 percent, what will the Ministry be doing? Will there be other mitigation processes that you will need to consider in order to help the people of this country, considering the fact that you cut the taxation rate on the richest people in this country but not the poorer, and you have raised VAT in a lot of different areas? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD – That is, again, a bit of a hogwash. Let me explain this, since he raised the ANZ prediction. The recent report, Mr. Speaker, by Dr. Kishti Sen and I have known him for years and his inflation numbers. I understand that was probably the key motivation for the question. In fact, Mr. Speaker, what Dr. Kishti Sen is saying, is that inflation in 2022 stood at 18 percent to 21 percent. They do not talk about that. Inflation in 2023 is around 13 percent. Let me state this very, very categorically, for ANZ and for everyone, that Dr. Kishti Sen is absolutely, completely wrong about that projection. I will explain why. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is quite a ridiculous suggestion from an ANZ economist and because it is going to create wrong impressions amongst the people and honourable Usamate is using that. I will explain to you why it is wrong and ANZ really, should be careful in making those kind of wild projections.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am answering the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the methodology that they used and I think he got it wrong, was based on the gross value added of the retail trade sector. And, Mr. Speaker, we all know and honourable Usamate would know that as an economist - a one-time economist, that the gross value added and expenditure as a proxy for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is completely incorrect! Completely incorrect! And is not used anywhere in the world to measure inflation. So, the projection that it will be 13 percent is based on the wrong method. The simple reason is that the Gross Value Added Expenditure (GVA) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure, Mr. Speaker, measure different things, and many items which are produced and sold in Fiji, included in the retail gross value added, are not part of the CPI basket.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1962</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 A very simple example, Mr. Speaker, if you look at hardware prices, the building materials, prices have a separate index which is known as the building material index. That rose by 13 percent in 2022, so clearly, using that as a proxy for retail trade gross value added approach will be completely biased. They need to listen to this because they can explain to the people correctly because, otherwise, they will go and lie, Mr. Speaker. Let me also explain, the honourable Usamate talked about the mitigation measures. Mr. Speaker, obviously, they do not talk about this because when they go out, they talk to the people, they just say, “Oh, prices have gone up!” (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Even when there is a list publicly put out by FCCC that the prices have gone down for certain items, the list is there, they actually put out the detail of the brand, Mr. Speaker, that has gone down, they do not talk about it. But let me just answer this question that he raised about mitigation. Mr. Speaker, this Government started by recognising well before the Budget that the people were still transitioning for low income, loss of jobs, so as soon as we came in, as a Government, we allocated $50 million. We paid $200 each to 227,000 students in the country to get back to their school. Then when we came to the Budget, we made sure that we did not raise VAT on the 22 food items. In fact, we added basic medicine. Mr. Speaker, we made sure that we increase the social welfare allowances by 15 percent and 25 percent. We made sure that we provided additional support and subsidies to farmers in the Agriculture Sector. We made sure that the sugarcane farmers in the history of sugarcane farmers in this country got the highest price and we put $8 million. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate talked about the fact that we reduced the tax for the rich. He forgot to mention that we actually raised the Company Tax from 20 percent to 25 percent. We made, Mr. Speaker, sure that we did not touch the threshold. We did not increase the tax for almost 70 percent to 80 percent of the people in this country who earn below $30,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are taking one little example of Fiji Water and saying, “Oh, the tax and one irrelevant politician or as the honourable Prime Minister said, spent force, is still talking about it. They also forget that we wrote off $650 million for 53,000 families and their children. The burden of paying that debt every month, every week, every fortnight has been lifted from them. So, all the mitigation measures that we have put in to address any increase and a lot of these prices. They talk about the fuel price. During COVID-19, when the fuel prices went down, instead of letting the people benefit from the reduction, their Government put an additional 20 percent and it was 40 percent. When we were raising it before the election, they then reduced it to 20 percent. Now, they are talking about another 20 percent. This is the lie and hogwash that they created when they go out there, Mr. Speaker. This is a</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1963 government which is conscious and aware, and we have put in the appropriate mitigation measures and if need be, we will put more. Plus, we have put in an additional $45 million and every student from pre-school to Form 7 with income less than $50,000, before the school opens next year, they will get $200 each. Poverty Alleviation Programme – Monitoring Mechanism (Question No. 149/2023) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection update Parliament on the monitoring mechanism in place on the implementation of the Poverty Alleviation Programme to ensure that Government investment covers the targeted beneficiaries? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that question but before I answer, I would like to join the honourable Whip, as the Minister for Children, to wish all our children in Fiji a Happy World Children’s Day today with the theme, “For Every Child Every Right”. In response to the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think new Members who are here maybe hearing this for the first time - the existence of the Poverty Monitoring Unit (PMU) in the Ministry. However, as you all aware, we have changed the name of the Unit to Social Protection because according to the Coalition Government, poverty alleviation is a pervasive issue that all Ministries across Government should have their own programmes to alleviate poverty. However, I wish to explain the monitoring mechanism in place, Mr. Speaker, that it works with the Ministry of Finance through the various line Ministries that implement the Poverty Alleviation Programmes. They gather the baseline information which includes beneficiary listing, the budget of those programmes and the performance of those programmes from a programme implementor’s point of view who are in the Ministries. This baseline information is really important as it sets the platform of the PMU’s Impact Assessment Survey. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, the Unit has been monitoring, identified poverty alleviation programmes to gauge the impact of Government initiatives across the four Divisions. These assessment surveys are carried out through interviewing beneficiaries, project visitation and obtaining the views of the programme implementors. The PMU has monitored over 60 programmes from the financial year of 2016 to 2022. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key measures are the standard of living before the assistance and after the assistance, the access to services, the support systems and income level. The findings of the survey which includes project observation and challenges shared by the interviewed beneficiaries are highlighted to the programme implementors in each Ministry to further assist them to improve delivery. To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the results of the survey and the report highlighted that Government investments over the years have had positive impacts on the interviewed beneficiaries and individual, group and community-based levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to think that the entire Parliament is united in battling poverty at all levels and so there is an improvement gauged in the last five years through responses before and after assistance was provided in their standard of living, increase in the level of income,</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1964</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 employment creation, expanding business and project and access to services, to name a few. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that across the Ministries there were, in the last five years, non-active projects or partially active projects. And this, Mr. Speaker, is what PMU - the information they have to assist Ministries to activate non-active projects or partially active projects that would have been budgeted for the year. So, year in year out, they can be low utilisation for projects which Ministries need to improve on. The responses gathered from the interviewed beneficiaries are due too and this is what they have responded to – • • • • • • • • Lack of comprehensive feasibility studies prior to the implementation of the project - the general lack of a feasibility study whether this particular money or budget should be thrown into a project. Lack of technical-related training, Lack of monitoring the status of the project, Lack of ownership from the beneficiaries, Lack of support from amongst the group members themselves, Climate change risks, Non-availability of market, High cost of raw materials for projects such as speed and lack of collaboration amongst Government Ministries, who can collectively work to sustain a project. It is also noted that there are issues that are process related, such as standard operating procedures or proper policies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PMU has proposed a way forward that will assist Ministries. It will assist programme implementors to ensure project sustainability in the future such as, the need for comprehensive feasibility studies by Ministries before committing to a project, the need for project recipients themselves to take ownership and encourage working together, connecting farmers to potential markets and the possibility of cost subsidy to avoid middlemen who always reap the fruit of farmers’ hard labour and strengthen network in collaboration with important stakeholders to support in the effective management of these projects. Mr. Speaker, the Coalition Government is committed, and this was very important information we got from the PMU in order for each Ministry, now that we have put poverty alleviation across the Ministries to be able to address the challenges that were highlighted by PMU in the last five years. Mr. Speaker, at this point, we all agree that there is space to improve and we are committed to that. The PMU is working closely with the Ministry of Finance in terms of the review of the Poverty Alleviation Eradication Strategy Framework 1999. So it is almost 14 years old and this has not been reviewed in the last 14 years. This will include the development of the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework or Integrated National Poverty Eradication that goes across the Ministries. Also, the Unit is working in our Ministry on the establishment of the first ever National Committee on Poverty Alleviation. So, Government is committed through a National Committee from Cabinet to spearhead Government’s effort in monitoring and evaluating existing programmes as well as playing a critical role in providing national direction to the Government or of Government as well as sectoral budget and planning with efficient and effective economic advice in addressing the socio-economic multi-dimensional issue of poverty embedded across all levels of society.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1965 HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- A supplementary question; can the honourable Minister also outline what the Coalition Government has committed in this year’s budget to help the Ministry alleviate poverty? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Assistant Minister for the question. I think the honourable Minister of Finance has very eloquently outlined some of the immediate steps that the Coalition Government took when it came into office. But let me highlight them again, Mr. Speaker, just as a reminder to the people of what the Coalition Government coming into Parliament or into Government has taken steps to address this. As you had heard from the honourable Minister of Finance, there was the assistance for back-to-school for families of $50 million and this is now being issued again for the next school year. Also, Mr. Speaker, we wrote-off $650 million student debts so that it alleviates our students from the burden of debt. It was also mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister in terms of the increase in budget all around in the social services sector, almost $200 million increase in the National Budget of the Social Services Sector as well as the Agriculture Sector, almost doubled in budget. Of course, you have heard that the sugarcane farmers are getting the highest price ever to have received, as well as no VAT increases on the 21 items, plus medicine added as number 22. These are the commitments by the Coalition Government, and it will only increase in terms of our commitment to alleviate poverty across all Ministries, and I thank programme implementors in the Ministries who are committed to ensure that we are alleviating poverty across Government. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker Sir, but let me remind the other side of Parliament, when they took away the money for school assistance, they denied the other sectors that were allocated because that money was taken out from an allocation that already existed too. While they took away the $600 million debt to the school, they added another $600 million as well to the debt of the country. Sir, my simple question to the honourable Minister is, you have talked about the non-active and partially active projects. Is it possible to name a few and what are you going to do about it? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to furnish that information to the honourable Leader of the Opposition in terms of the list which is with the Poverty Monitoring Unit, but as each Minister, as you come into office and you review your budget, you will see that there are low utilization projects that needs to be utilised more in order to alleviate poverty. One example I give from our Ministry, in terms of the low utilization for rural pregnant mothers’ programme which we discovered. This just happened to be associated with the difficulty of rural pregnant mothers coming from outer islands to come to the main cities to give birth if they face complications or issues like that. There was just not a very good, streamlined process where rural pregnant mothers could be assisted to come to the main centres and we are looking at improving that, Mr. Speaker, to assist them in terms of their transportation and also their accommodation in the main cities when they come from rural areas. Early School Dropouts and Truancy (Question No. 150/2023) HON. A. N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on how the Ministry is addressing the problem of early school dropouts and truancy amongst primary and secondary school students?</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1966</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. I would like to state that this question on school dropouts is everyone’s concern and there is no quick fix solution to this particular challenge. Let me just give some background. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Office of the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, by the year 2020, there were still 260 million children who did not attend primary or secondary schools despite of the aspirations of Sustainable Goal 4 which is to ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education. The initial report states that without urgent action in a decade, 825 million children - half of all young people in the world, will not have the most basic skills necessary for jobs in the future. There are many reasons, Mr. Speaker Sir. So many young people are dropping out of school or been denied quality education and these reasons vary for each country and each obstacle is huge to the children trying to overcome them. The global reasons include child labour, it can be due to poverty or forced labour amongst others, lack of funding support from home, lack of empathy by teachers who are not so welcoming, not understanding school environment, hunger, difficult journey to school, gender bias, national conflicts, teenage pregnancies, natural disasters, et cetera. Most of these reasons resonates to our education system here in Fiji. Mr. Speaker Sir, our school dropout range has been on average 0.5 percent per year over the past eight years as recorded in the FEMIS system. These figures could vary slightly, given that not all registered schools in Fiji are captured under FEMIS, especially private-run schools. The Ministry of Education is working to initiate a process whereby all the students of Fiji need to be captured in a proper Ministry of Education system. For our secondary school dropouts, an average of 3.2 percent per year over the past eight years. A breakdown of this data can also be forwarded to the honourable Member if he so requests. Mr. Speaker, Sir, children and youth in vulnerable and disadvantaged communities are particularly at risk of educational exclusion. The recent September Education Status Report indicated that the highest number of school dropouts from primary and secondary education are of iTaukei male students in rural communities. What the Ministry of Education is strategising for early detection of risk of dropout is to provide intervention and this is done by the heads of schools and teachers. These are counselling hubs, and this is now widely encouraged for students and teachers, not only to address students’ truant behaviour, but also concerns and needs intervention through the Fiji’s Psychological Society for early detection of underlying medical or psychological issues that are often left undetected and create barriers for healthy development and growth. Continuation of the free education support to address financial barriers and high education scholarships, the Drugs and Substance Abuse Unit of the Ministry of Education based in Nasinu is engaging with schools and communities on the problems of drug use and advocating against the use and peddling of such drugs by students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I attended a Natabua High School Annual Prize-giving Ceremony, and we were briefed on how a student had been noted to miss school a lot and was eventually caught peddling drugs. The school investigated the student’s background and provided counselling sessions for this young man. It was discovered the student was being coerced to sell drugs. He was offered a boarding space and was happy to accept it at the Natabua School. He has since done well in school and his behaviour has taken leaps and bounds in terms of his personality and character and shows very positive signs of becoming a well-balanced young man. This is what the Ministry of Education is encouraging schools to do, and that is to find solutions to resolve student challenges. Sending children out of school as a disciplinary measure will not only dump the problem to another school, there is highly likelihood that because other schools</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1967 refuse to take students sent home to find another school, the student actually becomes a dropout with the possibility of soon becoming involved in crime because of neglect and rejection issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues with the hope programmes, whereby, extra support is provided to students and trainings for our teaching staff to integrate creative and innovative methods of keeping children engaged in our classrooms. We also hope to provide more training to teachers and through our teacher training colleges in how to be understanding, kind, tolerant and inspiring teachers with patience and tenacity to turn a problematic student into a success story. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being no supplementary question, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.34 p.m.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1968</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 2.34 p.m. Criteria – Great Council of Chiefs Membership (Question No. 151/2023) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the specific criteria and requirements in place that needs to be adhered to by chiefs representing any Fijian province to qualify for membership within the Great Council of Chiefs? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. In appointing members to the Great Council of Chiefs Vakaturaga Conference this year, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs was guided by the GCC Regulation 2023. The criteria for membership remains clear. A chief need to be a turaga iTaukei confirmed by the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission (TLFC). They must not be discharged bankrupt, in-mates or extra-mural prisoners or persons of unsound mind. Additionally, their nomination must come from their Bose Vanua. While members of the GCC must traditionally be confirmed in their position as Turaga i Taukei, we acknowledge the current high vacancy rates in chiefly titles. For those reasons, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs adopts a flexible approach in this year’s appointment. Moving forward the TLFC will work diligently to fill this vacancy. To further address this, we have initiated training programmes for future members of the GCC. The i Sausauvou Programme, a six-week course, is designed to prepare upcoming traditional leaders for vanua leadership. We successfully completed this programme in seven provinces. Despite these challenges, our criteria and training programme ensure that appointed members uphold the integrity and effectiveness of the GCC. Transportation Issues - Mainland and Outer Islands (Question No. 152/2023) HON. J. N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the measures being used to address the issues of transportation between the mainland and the outer islands? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. It is sort of a general question so I will touch on a few issues regarding maritime on the transportation, basically mainland and outer islands focusing on maritime. Of course, the Ministry and our various agencies consider safety as one of the main responsibilities. As we may understand, the provision of inter-island shipping is categorised into two types of services - economical routes and uneconomical routes. The economical routes are profitable in nature, frequently serviced by ship operators and having a higher return in investment in terms of carriage of goods and services. These routes are not subsidised by the Government. There have been various data on this, Sir, and recently we have seen a high number of movement in terms of passenger movements. For example, in terms of the Eastern Division, covering Natovi and Levuka, there were more than 500,000 passenger movements in these ports between 2021 and 2023. Also, the Western Division, we have seen a significant increase, given the improved performance of tourism, signifying growth as the Coalition Government came in. Cargo movement has also increased from in</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1969 a million tonnes in 2021 to 2.4 million in 2022, according to the data on that. In terms of uneconomical routes, vessel operators are provided with schedules from the Ministry, particularly in terms of Natovi and Narain Jetties. Uneconomical routes have low passenger and cargo capacity. The cost of the inter-island shipping services to uneconomical routes outweighs the investment caused for shipping owners, which is why some of these routes are covered by the Franchise Scheme which is a subsidised Scheme. The Ministry is being allocated $3.2 million in this financial year to subsidise private vessel operators to provide inter-island shipping services to 10 uneconomical routes in terms of the franchise. The three operators that provide at this moment are: 1. Goundar Shipping Limited; 2. 3. Interlink Shipping Line Limited; and Brighton Holdings Limited. Currently, they are vented into a 10-year agreement and this is reviewed every five years. Some of the areas serviced include Northen Lau, Yacata, Vanuabalavu, Tuvuca and Cikobia, Yasayasa Moala route which covers Naroi, Keteira, Maloku in Moala, Qalikarua in Matuku and services Tovu and Udu in Totoya. Upper Southern Lau Route include Vanuavatu, Nayau, Lakeba, Oneata, Komo, Moce and Namuka-i-Lau. Lomaiviti Route covers Gau – Qarani, Sawaieke, Nawaikama and Nacavanadi; and for Nairai – Lawaki, Waitoga and Nakasava in Batiki. Of course, in Kadavu, several villages are just covered by the franchise scheme. It also provides for monthly services to other areas I have not mentioned including Rotuma; Yasawa; Beqa; Yanuca; Vatulele and other islands in the lower Southern Lau. The franchise service is not only limited to those ports, but we have encouraged service providers to service nearby Ports where the franchise company is on the route. In terms of some figures from 2018 to 2023 the franchise successfully serviced and transported an accumulated total of 81,790 passenger movements averaging 6,800 passenger movements per year. In terms of moving forward, we are currently reviewing the Franchise Agreement given the increased demands and also of course from the shipping operator side, the increased operational cost related to operating the ships. In other reviews, we are looking at digitalising the whole process so that it is better managed in terms of the schedules monitoring and of course a performance review of the whole franchise. In terms of not only the economic side but also how cost effective it is, whether we are budgeting enough or are we doing enough to service our maritime communities. In addition, in response to that question we also have the Government Shipping Services. This comes under the Ministry with various vessels under its operation. He asked the general question, so I am giving a general answer. So, if you had asked about Government Shipping Service (GSS) or franchise I would have just focused on that area. It is also</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1970</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 good for information. I know you were away for a while, so when you came back, I thought I would explain it, just to update you. Mr. Speaker, the GSS fleet needs to be modernised and upgraded. I know under the last Government, they did one or two purchases but the rest of the fleet is aging so we are looking at not only an increased budget but also we are currently talking to various development partners in terms of the replacement for that. In addition, we need to run our transport system more effectively as we face climate change issues and move away from fossil fuels, that is another challenge which we are looking into. The last point, there has been a lot of things I understand, and in terms of the whole shipping fleet, some of our maritime communities are complaining about the cost of freight and at the moment, Fiji Consumer Competition Commission is currently undertaking a market study for the domestic shipping industry, not only on the rates and charges but also on the industry at large, including market players, infrastructure, regulations. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see that the honourable Minister has continued all the work that we did, because nothing that he has mentioned is obviously new, it is all news. We are invested in GSS ships, specialised ships, specialised boats. We also came up with the idea of the 10-year licence to make sure and to encourage people that run these ships to invest in new boats, so there is nothing new. I look forward to the time, Honourable Minister when you come up with your own ideas. One question, one of the things that makes the bus industry, people that use bus services as well because they are licensed. When there are times for you to go, you have to go. If you do not go, you can be penalised. This is not in place for boats. So, I am just wondering whether there has been any discussion, because a lot of the complaints about the islands that when the boat is supposed to come and it did not come, and then sometimes the boat owners for their own reasons, they decide not to do it, they say ‘I am going to stop my ships going’. This licensing where you have to go at this particular time, if you do not, there could be a penalty. Is there any consideration? That is a question, it has got a question mark at the end of licensing. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- You know, you cannot operate in Fiji like you are operating in New Zealand and Australia because we have to have some leeway for social considerations. That is what the Coalition Government is about unlike the Fiji First Government, they apply the law and punish. That is different from us. At the moment I mentioned we are already reviewing - the performance review of the franchise. Yes, definitely, recently we had a case where there were threats to the boat owner, so they did not want to turn up. There have been issues like that, but there have been reasons provided by the boat owners. On the compliance, MSAF is currently responsible for that and they are working diligently on the compliance issues which cover that type of operations and they are there at the beginning of the trip to look at the compliance issues before the trip and during and after. So they do separate reports to GSS and to MSAF, if there is a breach then they are addressed through those two mechanisms. MR. SPEAKER.- A supplementary question, honourable Minister, on the route licensing. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- All those issues will be accumulated and will depend on whether it is renewed or not. So that is how we will deal with it.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1971 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, the honourable Minister stated that we, the FijiFirst Government, did a few purchases. Let me remind him that when we came, there was only the Dausoko, Kaunitoni and Vatulawa. So, the rest of the Government fleet was purchased through this Government, when we were in Government. But the question is, we are in the disaster period Sir, he talked about the Government fleet and what we would like to know is, what percentage of the Government fleet is operational that can do the job for the Minister if needed, when we have a disaster. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of the availability, I have worked closely with the Minister for Rural Development and Disaster Management that the fleet is available 100 percent in terms of the need as determined by the National Disaster Management Office and we have streamlined that process. He does not have to ask me all the time and the other issue about the percentage of availability, I do not have the figures right now, I can get back to you on that. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is on the transport on mainland. What measures are being taken to address the issue of transportation faced by students in Lautoka area, in particular the following – Viseisei, Saweni, Vaivai, Raviravi and other nearby areas. That is because students have to walk miles to reach to and from school and this is because of irregular bus service since August 2023. HON. K. K. LAL.- What is the Minister doing? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I heard them saying very poor. Yes, it is very poor for them not to coordinate their questions or understanding of the question because if you read the question, it says “between the mainland and the outer islands”. There is nothing there which says, ‘within the mainland’, can you re-pose that as a new question. (Honourable Members interject) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Areh, the question says, between mainland and outer islands. Do you understand what “between” means? Between means point A and B, that is that, not within. Between is different. MR. SPEAKER.- Too many areh going on. Indian Government Grant on 100-Bed Hospital (Question No. 153/2023) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the development of the 100-bed hospital via the Indian Government Grant? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question. I am glad to give an update on the development of the 100-bed hospital via the Indian Government Grant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government of India has reaffirmed its commitment to the Pacific region with major projects planned for the 14 countries of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC). This was announced when India’s Prime Minister, honourable Sir Narendra Modi, delivered his keynote address at the 3 rd FIPIC Summit in Papua New Guinea where he outlined prospects for regional assistance and increased collaboration between India and the region.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1972</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Sir, as part of an action plan to strengthen the Indo-Pacific Island Countries partnership, India will construct a 100-bed regional super speciality hospital for Fiji. The offer by the Government of India to build the 100-bed super speciality cardio hospital in Fiji was also discussed in February 2023 during the visit to India by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor B. C. Prasad, and also subsequently by the visit of the Indian Minister for External Affairs, honourable Jaishankar when he visited earlier on. With the hospital, the Government of India is going to provide equipment and human resources for the operations of the hospital for a period of time. At the moment, Sir, the land has been identified at Nasinu and the team from India is expected to arrive soon to begin the actual work. In terms of the commencement of the project, it will start most likely mid-next year, Mr. Speaker.
