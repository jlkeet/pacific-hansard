<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI AIRPORTS 2020 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><h4>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI AIRPORTS 2020 ANNUAL REPORT</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the review of the 2020 Fiji Airports Annual Report which was tabled on 3 rd April, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports is responsible for the operation of 15 public airports in the Fiji Islands. These include: • • two international airports – Nadi International Airport, Fiji’s main international gateway, and Nausori Airport, Fiji’s domestic hub; and 13 outer island airports. Fiji Airports also provides Air Traffic Management in the Nadi Flight Information Region. This includes the airspace of Fiji, Tuvalu, New Caledonia, Kiribati and Vanuatu – covering an area of 6 million square kilometres. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports is a fully owned Government Commercial Company that was established in April 1999 into a separate commercial and regulatory authority under the Public Enterprises Act 1996. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports’ establishment was part of an overall Government policy to ensure that Government entities were more efficient, productive and accountable, and more focussed on commercial activities and profitability. The outer island airports are operated as part of Fiji Airports’ social obligation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, Fiji Airports recorded a net operating profit before tax of $1.6 million. Fiji Airports declared a total of $175 million in dividend over the last six years from 2014 to 2019. Despite this unprecedented dividend payout, the total shareholder equity stood at $488.6 million. The operation of Fiji Airports was severely affected by the prolonged COVID-19 global economic crisis, which negatively affected its revenue. However, it remained steadfast to emerge strong as an organisation, having necessarily gained insights, developed strategies and prudently restructured its business model for the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee is yet to receive a substantive response on the Standing Committee Report, as according to Standing Orders 121(6)(b), which requires the agency to provide the response within 21 days of receiving the report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion, but doing so, just like in the previous motions, I have a list from the Whips on those who will participate in the debate, as follows: (1) Hon. A. A. Maharaj; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1990 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 (3) Hon. V. Lal; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to give my short contribution with regards to the review of the Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report. Before I do so, I would like to congratulate the newly appointed CEO of Fiji Airports Limited, Mr. Mesake Nawari, who is taking the lead role in gearing up Fiji Airports from where it was left by the former CEO, the late Mr. Faiz Khan. We should thank the late Mr. Khan for his contribution towards the leadership of Fiji Airports. Mr. Speaker, one thing that we have actually seen, if we look at the record, that in 2006, Airports Fiji Limited used to make an annual profit of around $0.5 million. In 2019, Airports Fiji Limited made a record profit of close to $80 million and they almost made a 50 percent payout in dividend. I know what the Government side will actually oppose is increasing the rental of real estates and the tenants that we were able to actually get that much of profit. But we should thank Mr. Khan for uplifting the face of Nadi Airport itself. That is one of the only airports in Fiji that is making profit. The rest of the 13 airports, including Nausori Airport, are basically social or corporate responsibility of Fiji Airports Limited. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the one side while Fiji Airports Limited pays dividend to the Government, on the other side, they also have a social responsibility of running these 13 airports which are basically non-profitable. So, it is kind of double-dipping and I urge the Government to consider giving something back to Fiji Airports Limited so that they can run those 13 other non- profitable airports that they are managing at this point in time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why we see Nadi International Airport making profit is because the planes are landing at Nadi Airport. They pay substantial amount of fees to land and taxi at the Airport, so that is one of the reasons. Mr. Speaker, back in 2020, there were a lot of calls to actually sell those planes that are landing at Nadi Airport. Had we actually taken that decision to sell all these Fiji Airways planes, Mr Speaker, what would we have done with these airports now that we know that tourism is one of the biggest factor why our economy has boomed back to where it is today. Sometimes strong decisions were taken, we had to take those decision and we should thank the FirstFirst Government... HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- … for not listening to the Opposition back then and sending the planes that they were actually requesting. Unfortunately, honourable Gavoka is not here who was playing the lead role in telling the Government to sell the planes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> The state of the airport, Mr. Speaker, as I said, Nadi Airport has been commended by a lot of visitors coming to Fiji… HON. K. K. LAL.- Hear, hear! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.-... that arriving at Nadi Airport is one of the best airports that they can actually flew in to the South Pacific.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report 1991 Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that same note I would like to request there was a banner in Labasa Terminal back in 2020 to upgrade the terminal. When we used to fly to Labasa Airport we used to see that banner ever since this Government has come into picture they have pulled down that particular banner and I do not know where the banner is. Please look into it, people of Labasa and Vanua Levu...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Refurbishment:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Yes, it is almost a year now, should have done it by now. Do not say you are going to do it after we have actually raised this in Parliament”. It was a very good design, Mr. Speaker, the terminal and while I am talking about the terminal that also brings me to this particular point about Northern Airways. I believe that is the only Airways that is actually owned by a local. The charges of Northen Airways is quite substantial. At the moment it is only flying once to Labasa. Initially it used to be two trips - morning and afternoon. He is giving a quite good competition to Fiji Link as well in providing a very good fare for the citizens to fly from Suva to Labasa and back to Suva as well. They should be given some kind of rebate in terms of what they are actually paying in fees to Airports Fiji Limited, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that we can see that a local owner of a local airways company.... HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You are trying to destroy it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> No, no, we never did.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Your former boss did:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- What have you been doing for a year now:</span> still waiting? (Chorus of interjection) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some of the things that I would like to mention about Airports Fiji Limited, they are doing a wonderful job and I wish the former Management and the current Management as well for the future endeavours. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this motion that we debate the Review Report of Fiji Airports 2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report was quite comprehensive, it gave us the responsibilities and also the ups and downs of their performance. This report is about the Year 2020. I will go straight to the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because noting all those ups and downs, the reasons and also giving themselves time to look at why they have been subjected to the vagaries of business and international travel, they have come up with certain resolutions on how to perform better into the future. The Committee has made recommendations after studying the Report and the first recommendation is that the Committee recommends that Fiji Airports embark on and prioritise the commercial development of its real estate portfolio to maximise its non-aeronautical revenue stream. From the Government’s point of view, the recommendation is noted. Fiji Airports current non- aeronautical revenue is mainly from concessions and rental revenue from officers, warehouses, land leases and housing and right now they are going to diversify their revenue sources and venture into real estate and alternative revenue streams to mitigate future disruptions in the aviation industry.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1992 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 In view of that, Fiji Airports will conduct a development plan assessment of potential land development opportunities associated with the land in Namaka. My last visit to them, I was shown the map and all the potential areas for development which all look very promising. The proposed development plan is expected to spend over the next 25 years and will engage consultants to assist in the development of a master plan for land development and progress plan. The second recommendation that the Committee made as part of its social responsibility, the Government considers providing support to Fiji Airports for the implementation of its Capital Work Programme for Outer Island Airports. The Committee recommendation is noted, a major component of Fiji Airports’ Capital Work Programme is the maintenance of outer island airports and in that regard, Fiji Airports has also developed an outer island infrastructure plan. In recent years, Fiji Airports has been internally financing its capital works including outer island maintenance. In terms of major capital projects, they have secured $40 million loan from ANZ and the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP). Government supports the Fiji Airports efforts in maintaining the outer island airport and has assisted Fiji Airports in facilitating international funding in terms of financing and grants towards the outer island airports development. As a result of discussions between Government and the World Bank in relation to the 10-year tourism projects in Vanua Levu, we have plans to upgrade airport facilities in Labasa and Savusavu. Recommendation three is noted, which is to prepare a contingency plan to account for possible future events or circumstances and all the recommendations as contained in the Report from our Social Affairs Committee are noted by the Government and we promise to follow through with that. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Review of the Fiji Airports Annual Report 2020 and I also would like to thank the Committee for the Report. With the support of Fiji Airports, Fiji was one of the fastest growing economies after the devastating effects of COVID-19. Infact, some of the Opposition Members then were not in favour of buying more planes and some had made TikTok mocking the decision to buy airbuses. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. LAL.- Through these planes a lot of tourists came to Fiji and our economy started moving towards normalcy. It was the foresight of the FijiFirst Government that has led to the development of the Fiji Airports to where it is today. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. V. LAL.- Sir, prior to the pandemic, Nadi International Airport handled an average of 41 international flights per day. With no flights, the airports’ revenue evaporated and with no passengers coming through arrival and departure terminals, airports’ tenants were not able to meet their lease obligations. Aviation and travel industries were the greatest corporate casualties of the pandemic. There were massive job losses, pay cuts and reduced working hours worldwide. Fiji Airports capacity to remain a viable business entity to meets its operational expenses and credit obligations, put the company under immense financial pressure. Despite the momentous challenges faced during</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report 1993 COVID-19, Fiji Airports was able to progress and commission new state of the art Air Traffic Management System in April 2021. In November 2020, Fiji Airports achieved a milestone by obtaining a Certification of Airport Health Accreditation from the Airports Council International. Sir, COVID-19 pandemic caused the total international passenger movement to shrink by 81 percent, not only that but it also affected the balance sheet and resulted in the worst financial performance. During the pandemic, Fiji Airports continued to provide employment to our people through a management restructure and staff reduction. Nadi is also the only airport in the South Pacific to have received Level 3 Airport Carbon Accreditation. In 2020, the two major projects including the Nausori Runway Upgrade and Extension Project and the Nadi Offgates Apron Project had commence before the pandemic and had continued based on its needs and the downturn in aircraft movement. In November 2021, the Nausori International Airport Runway Project had reached completion despite COVID-19’s impact. The Nausori Runway Upgrade and Extension Project has enhanced the Boeing 737 aircraft movements in and out of Nausori. This has allowed airlines to carry more passengers on the Boeing 737 compared to previous load restrictions. This runway upgrade has changed international travel in and out of Nausori for the greater good of the Deuba/Nausori corridor. It allows for the further extension of the runway to cater for Airbus A350 movements. Mr Speaker, Sir, all these developments took place when the FijiFirst Government was in place. The FijiFirst Government always worked towards improving its services and making sure these services reached the wider communities. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! HON. V. LAL.- With this Coalition Government, you cannot say the same, as in the past 11 months, we have not seen any real progress but a lot of contradictions - on one hand saying something and the other hand doing the opposite. One such example, the Government is talking about protecting our oceans and marine resources, but the honourable Prime Minister goes ahead and allows Japan to dump its nuclear waste in the ocean. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. LAL.- Sir, I can give many such examples but I will leave that to my colleagues. There are many questions regarding the charter flight to Israel. Who is going to bear the cost of this charter flight? There are many unanswered questions about this issue? Sir, a lot of questions were also asked about the so called conspiracy theory about Waqavuka. I hope that is all clarified now after a statement was issued on this. With these words, Sir, I once again thank the Committee for its recommendations so that further improvements could be done to better the services of Fiji Airports. MR. SPEAKER: Thank you honourable Virendra Lal for your wonderful counter-punches. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute to the debate on the Review of the Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report and I noticed that the FijiFirst Government always gets preoccupied itself aggrandisement or self-praise. Sometimes they speak about the wrong company, Sir. We are talking about Fiji Airports, they were talking about Fiji Airways; I am not sure how that is related. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they praise themselves for what the performance of Fiji Airports, but I think you have to stack back a bit in history and the credit for that sits with the honourable Prime Minister</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1994 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2020 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 because he started the reform process of Fiji Airports. Before it was altogether, the regulatory arm and the commercial arm, the honourable Prime Minister had the vision to separate it and what we have today is, not from them, the origin came from this side of Parliament. So, I thought I just remind them of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The other thing that I would like to thank them for is, they almost sold every other asset in Fiji. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That side of Parliament:</span></p><p>The only asset that was left is Fiji Airports; everything else they have sold. So, I have to thank them for that. Trust me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will not sell our assets as wilfully as the other side of Parliament has done. The third one was, this was just more sort of a sharing from my side. They lament that there is only one profitable part of Fiji Airports and there are 12 other airports that are non-profitable. That is a fact of life in our country. There is only one point of entry and so, there is close subsidisation that happens. It is a responsibility that we have to bear as part of delivering services to our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I also join the chorus in congratulating the new CEO, Mr. Mesake Nawari. A lot of us know him on a personal basis. He is a man of calibre, and I know that the other side of Parliament is asking about what we are going to do. Give him time, he will impress you all. He is making plans to develop the airport in Labasa, that is why the signage may come down in Labasa. He is making plans for Nadi, as we all know, we are getting more aircrafts into Nadi. We need 5,000 rooms, therefore, we will need a bigger airport. These are the plans on this side of Parliament that Mesake will bring at the appropriate time. In terms of the Report itself, you have to congratulate Fiji Airports and its management at that time. They were facing a very difficult time in 2020, and both sides of Parliament congratulate them for managing themselves through a very difficult time in our country. We also note with encouragement that during that time, they actually managed to get accreditation as well in terms of carbon accreditation, and I understand that they are still the only airport in the South Pacific that has such accreditation. We also would like to congratulate them for that. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two other points in the Report that I thought I would highlight. The first one was, there was the recommendation about the expansion of non-aeronautical revenue, that was developed even when I used to be in aviation. The first steps were made during the time of the honourable Prime Minister, and I can see that with the expansion that is required at the airport, there will be opportunity for more non-aeronautical revenue with the expanded airport as with the other outer islands. This is more of an accounting matter, the other side of Parliament is always good at window dressing and for a long time they used to debate that the government grants needed to be recognised as capital rather than revenue. I am pleased to note that good sense has prevailed, and it is now recorded as revenue as it should be for proper accounting purposes. Once again, I congratulate the former and current management of Fiji Airports and wish them well in the expansion plans that they have, and I support the Report before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report 1995 HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have contributed to the motion before Parliament. I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed.</p></body>
