<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCTIVITYAND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 2016-2018 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCTIVITY AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 2016-2018 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 2016 to 2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 4 th April, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations is responsible for upholding the constitutional right of every Fijian to economic participation, adjust minimum wage, humane treatment in the workplace and proper working conditions. The Ministry promotes and advances the rights of workers and employers and administers and enforces the Employment Relations Act of 2007, Health and Safety at Work Act of 1997 and the National Employment Centre Act of 2009. Mr. Speaker, in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 financial years, the Ministry of Employment and Industrial Relations continue to support workplaces to become compliant, productive and inclusive in response to important legislative change, complex issues and growing community expectations. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry’s internal processes were changed and upgraded for re-certification to ISO 9001 of 2015 international standards in growing an efficient and effective work culture. The Ministry significantly expanded its service offerings through the launch of its customer services centre ensuring that more workers and businesses understood their entitlements and obligations. There was also easier access of services for the general public as well as the implementation of Fiji’s first ever National Employment Policy aimed at reducing unemployment. Mr. Speaker, the Committee acknowledges the continued work of the tripartite partners and strive to find solutions to achieve decent work and employment growth in Fiji. The Committee is yet to receive the substantive response on the Standing Committee Report as according to Standing Order 121(6)(b) which requires the agency to provide a response within 21 days of receiving the report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have a list of speakers provided by the honourable Whips that are before me. The debate will be led by honourable Bala, then followed by the honourable Minister for Labour, before honourable Rinesh Sharma takes the floor and will be rounded off by the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute briefly to the motion that is before us and at the outset, I would like to thank the Committee and in particular the Chairperson and the</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1996 Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 support staff. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is after lunch and as promised by the honourable Minister during the debate in the morning, he will hand in the report after lunch which I still have not received. So I hope by the end of the session my good friend will hand over that report to me. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, I will be very brief but this is my experience and observation. Before there were less Ministerial overseas trips to go and meet the seasonal workers and there were less issues. Now there are more Ministerial visits. Basically, every month there is a Ministerial visit with more issues and I am wondering what is really happening.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Neglect the issues and do your job:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> From morning, I was very quiet. I felt sorry for the honourable Minister, but she is trying to create some situations, but I will still leave that at that. I feel sorry for you anyway. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recent weeks there was a post from the workers who are under this Programme that the Ministerial visits are not well-coordinated.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Very hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> I request my good friend next time may be after two weeks he will go again, to visit the seasonal workers, to have a coordinated programme so that we do not have such problems here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us go into the Report itself on the key findings. It talks about the minimum wage rate and I would like to ask, as to when will there be a review of the national minimum wage rate as promised by the Government because there are a lot of discussions going on in regards to this, even this Report is connected to the Minimum Wage Rate and I urge Government to please look into it because the prices of goods are going up day by day but the wages and salaries are stuck at one place. I do not know for what reason the salaries for the honourable Ministers, backbenchers have been differed but if that was tabled, that would have been a suicide case for the Government, honestly. Let me tell you, whatever we may say here, people are suffering and we need to pay some of them Sir. We can come here and say a lot of things, Mr. Speak, Sir, but what is happening actually on the ground, that is something that we need to address and I hope the honourable Minister will take note of this and may be in his response, he will give us some programmes and the timelines when this exercise will take place. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these few comments I would like to thank you and the Committee as a whole, and I support the motion that is before us. HON. A. D. SINGH.- I rise to contribute to the debate on the Report. Firstly, I would like to convey my appreciation and commend the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for the Review of the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry is mandated to pursue the attainment of Distant Employment Standards through the Promotion of the Employment Opportunities, Provision of a Healthy and Safe Work Environments, Fair Employment Conditions, Good Faith Employment Relations and Productive Workplaces.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report 1997 Mr. Speaker, before I actually go any further just let me briefly respond to honourable Bala’s comment on the visitation. I will have a Ministerial Statement on the visitation and that is when he will get all the answers after that, Mr. Speaker, coming on Wednesday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this man never ever visited the workers, so what does he know about their plight? HON. P. K. BALA.- A Point of order, Mr. Speaker. The honourable Minister for Employment is misleading this Honourable House. I did visit, go and check the records in your office, you will find and if your staff are not giving that to you, that is not my problem, it is your staff’s problem. Honourable Pio, I have a lot of respect for you but I have seen you jumping up and down, there must be something wrong with you again.. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, the last three years I have visited the workers and the last three years nobody has visited them since they have been there since 2021. HON. J. USAMATE.- I have visited as a former Minister, Semi Koroilavesau visited as a former Minister. We all visited them. Standing in this House and saying that, is a complete lie, Sir. He has to withdraw that statement. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, they have a difficulty in understanding. I said the last three years, Mr. Speaker, let me continue. This report is for the period 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Sir, this is part of the eight-year period of talk down, dictatorial rule. The labour laws have been amended unilaterally to deny workers their fundamental rights, deny workers decent work and a decent living, livelihood. As reported earlier, Mr. Speaker, we are now in the process of reviewing and amending all those laws to ensure that we restore all those rights that were forcefully taken away. Mr. Speaker, this week there is a Bill coming to this Parliament, to this House, to be tabled by the Honourable Attorney General tomorrow. To begin with, by correcting the Essential National Industries List to the EIA 2007 listing, in compliance with the ILO advice listing. I will be very much interested to see how the Opposition is going to react to that, Mr Speaker, whether they want to restore those rights or they still are opposed to restoring the fundamental rights of these people. We are also going to include in the Bill the six months provisions for reporting individual grievances which is now discriminatory. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has noted the recommendations highlighted by the Committee for improvement on the anomalies and the financial statements and all audits highlighted from the basic audits being qualified. Mr. Speaker, major issues that we have corrected are already in place in the auditing, and our auditing is no longer receiving qualified reporting. Mr. Speaker, we inherited a Ministry which had 25 percent vacant positions that needed to be filled. We have now filled, out of the 45 that were vacant, 25 and the other 20 have been advertised and they are in the process of being filled. With all these in place, we are hoping to be able to carry out our mandate better than what it used to be. Mr. Speaker, Sir during that period there were also 53 resignations. That is 26.5 percent of the total workforce in the Ministry. That is why, and the reason of course, Mr Speaker is obvious, the unilaterally imposed … HON. J. USUMATE.- Hogwash!</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>1998 Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> …. contractual appointments, Mr. Speaker ...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USUMATE.:</span> Hogwash!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> … and of course the fear of turning 55 tomorrow, if you spoke up.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we have also reorganised the Tripartite Boards according to ILO 144 and employers and workers are now being fully consulted and the Employment Relations Advisory Board (ERAB) is in place. Collective bargaining is now well and alive, workers and employers are coming together. Workers now have the right to strike ballots, several unions have taken strike ballots and we have then intervened and brought them to the table for free discussions, dialogue in good faith and we have been able to resolve all those differences that were existing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is hurting, I know it is hurting. You failed to do what you are supposed to do and it is hurting now. HON. P. K. BALA.- (Inaudible) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Good faith was totally missing in their days. There was nothing like good faith. The State being the worst employer, and it cascaded down to those other employers who wanted to take advantage and they did take advantage by treating workers unfairly in those days and all that is now a thing of the past. I must also thank the honourable Attorney-General for assisting us with the drafting and the Solicitor-General for drafting the Bill and also thanking the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for providing us with a legal drafter who is sitting in our Office now assisting us with the entire ERA which will be completed by January this year and tabled in the next Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OHS, draft Plant Regulation Bill and the draft Amendment Right Code, the draft Sawmill Regulations are currently under development in consultation with the OHS Board and it has been completed and it is going to be presented soon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the four-year ban on villages that the Committee has brought to our attention where people absconded when they were sent abroad to work. Actually, it began in 2019 and now that has lapsed so there is no more a ban and I can assure you Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current approach of providing the support to the challenges that workers are faced with when they are out there in that alien environment, through our interventions, is going to see that that is going to be reduced, so we will not need that kind of a ban anymore because of the proactive action that we are taking. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all in all, all the comments of the Committee have been taken on board by our Ministry and we are addressing that. With that brief intervention, I thank you for the opportunity. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Review of the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relation Report 2016–2017, 2017–2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the findings that were conducted then: 3,724 labour inspections were done from August 1 st, 2017 to July 31 st, 2018 on the new minimum wage rate. Those who did not comply were penalised and we also note from the report that the Ministry conducted public consultations around Fiji on the Government’s revised Seasonal Work Recruitment and Selection criteria.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report 1999 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the honourable Minister for Employment that he, together with Felix Anthony was part of the Fiji team to avoid Fiji from being suspended by the ILO in 2015 and 2016, yet he goes on that nothing was done again and again. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can talk about economic development, sustainability, connectivity, resilience, infrastructure, climate adaptation, mitigation - big fancy words. But in order for this to be implemented for our people in our country there needs to be a sense of belonging, a sense of equality where people feel that equal opportunities are available in Fiji because it is up to every individual to work towards a better life and this is what the FijiFirst Government was about addressing the root issue which of course they are far away from. Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming to 2023 we witnessed the gradual corrosion of Fiji’s Constitutional integrity and economic development affecting employment and productivity in these last 11 months. They have achieved nothing, employment is very difficult since the Coalition Government has come to power, businesses are struggling since the Coalition Government has come to power. Of course, the people are struggling with the high cost of living. In simple terms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government does not know, they do not know minimum of eight years are spent by some of them in Opposition and where are the alternative solutions to take the people forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is a very good example of bad governance. We have a Government here that cannot even reshuffle their Ministers properly. How do you expect them to improve employment and productivity in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, in the last 11 months, have shown that the women who hold employment at the national office are shown the backbenchers and one of the Ministers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact covered by Fijivillage in the media, she went on record for advocating for women participation in Municipal Elections and even at national office. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact I asked honourable Sashi Kiran, did she utter a single word in support of a female colleague when she was removed as a Leader of the Government in Parliament not a single word, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is the women empowerment, Mr. Speaker Sir, where you sit in Parliament... (Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.-... plays a significant role, right now no one is at the first bench which is very, very obvious. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Go and ask your leader what they did to former honourable Member Mereseini Vuniwaqa. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir,...</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! (Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- … honourable Professor Biman Prasad talks about fresh air, a breath of fresh air. Are you kidding me, breathe of fresh air. You have choked the people of Fiji with a high Cost of Living and you are talking about fresh air.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>2000 Review Report – MEPIR 2016-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 (Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, people are jobless, businesses are cashless because this Coalition Government is clueless. They fail to make one decision, stick to their decision and if it backfires, all they say is “I am sorry”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a washing machine mentality, they go this way and then they go that way. Indian communities they have a saying “ bina pendi ke lota ” unstable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have no direction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I support the findings of the Committee and I thank the Committee for fulfilling their mandate to review this Report. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the Report that was tabled here in Parliament on 4 th April, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Social Affairs have made several recommendations and those who had spoken before me have alluded or highlighted a number of those recommendations which I wish to add, just a few. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first recommendation was based on the challenge faced by the National Employment Centre (NEC) to register and track citizens who are unemployed to engage them in a range of activities as part of its selection process. In this regard, improving the NEC’s ability to register and also to track unemployed citizens can be achieved by imposing several of these measures or strategies which the Government is now going into. Modernising the registration system which includes upgrading the registration process by implementing a renewed digital system and developing an online platform or mobile applications that allows individuals to register very easily. Database management – Creation of a comprehensive database to store citizens’ information securely but also making them accessible, authorised personnel within the NEC framework to track the progress, job searchers, job matching and engagement of those who have applied to various activities. Regular Outreach and Communication – We also picked up on feedback mechanism, that is important to allow citizens who have enrolled with NEC and provide them with the experience and suggestions from NEC and what services are available. Collaboration and Partnership – This is also highlighted in the Report and that makes it important for forging of partnership and education institutions, NGOs and private sectors so that the range of opportunities expends that their available to citizens of Fiji. Training and Support for the NEC staff is also important, Mr. Speaker, and so Government will now ensure that the staff of the National Employment Centre are adequately trained in using the registration system that is there and improving the database to ensure that they also themselves are within par of what is needed to launch this programme and take it to the next level. Regular Evaluation and Adaptation – There is a requirement for periodic review of the registration and tracking process to identify areas where there might be bottlenecks so that we can release them and allow for a free flow of the process there at the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, on the issue that have been highlighted by the honourable Minister with regard to the review of the four-year ban imposed on villagers of absconding seasonal workers. I am not sure how and why that rule was, I am very glad that it is now being thrown out of the window. It is a very poorly developed practice, very poorly developed policy where everybody else gets to pay for</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 2001 the indiscretion of one. (Hon. P. K. Bala interjects) HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- The villagers are not in Government. These were policies that were put in place by the previous Government which flies in the face of every workers rights that you would probably have known in your time as Minister, honourable Bala. (Hon. P. K. Bala interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- It has been taken away:</span></p><p>So, what has been done is, in addition to ensuring that people who go overseas to work, they must also have clear expectation of what is required of them instead of punishing people who are still trying to get themselves to work overseas, we provide clear expectations to those who are about to go into these jobs. Allowing competitive compensation and also benefits is also one of the areas which the Government is now going to put more emphasis into and also providing positive work environment. There is going to be regular check-ins and feedback. The reason why the Minister has to go and check on those work programmes overseas is to ensure that if there are any places where difficulties have been encountered by those who work overseas, that they are arrested as quickly as they are found and that they be addressed as well. Exit interviews is also something that we also want to do is to ensure that workers who have returned from tour of duties overseas provide opportunities for the NEC to learn of what were the problems or the difficulties that they encountered when they were there. What we will do is then improve on the programme, uncover systematic issues, areas of disaffection and then improve with the programme. Bonds have also been suggested that Government needs to have a bond system like they use for scholarships which can be tailor-made to make sure that workers complete their tour of duties overseas also return home in time with their money. I support the motion that is before Parliament, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you for your indulgence. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU:- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all honourable Members who have contributed to the motion before Parliament and I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER:- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
