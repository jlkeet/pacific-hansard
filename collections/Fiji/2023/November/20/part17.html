VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 3 rd April, 2023.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 1981</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, as a member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Report of the Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee on the review of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2017–2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in April of this year, and I wish to proceed directly to reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in the Report. Sir, to begin with, there were few pertinent issues identified by the Committee which include that: (1) Parliament has made tremendous strides it contributing to the achievement of certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically SDG 5 and SDG10. (2) Parliament has been provided great support by the Department and donor partners such as the UNDP which have led to numerous noteworthy undertakings. (3) The working conditions for Members of Parliament and staff have been given priority which has allowed for Parliament to function well and carried out its mandate. (4) The welfare of Members of Parliament and staff be given ample emphasis so as to maintain a safe work environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Department and any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report. I will go straight into the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, put forth by the Committee for the consideration of Parliament and these includes: (1) The Committee commends the Department for its noteworthy achievement on SDG 5 and recommends that Parliament continues with its efforts in promoting gender equality and empowerment. (2) The Committee commends the Department for its achievement on SDG 10 in terms of physical accessibility to the Parliament complex and numerous initiatives introduced for expanding accessibility to Parliament business such as the sign language interpreters, however the Committee recommends the following to further support SDG 10, that: (a) Parliament considers improving accessibility to the Complex by fast tracking the installation of aids such as direction signs and other means of accessibility which cater for persons who have mobility issues; and (b) Parliament further considers introducing other initiatives such as Hansard being published in the different vernacular languages and also in braille. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee believes that these would promote inclusivity in our society especially those who take interest in our Parliament sessions. Furthermore, the Committee recommends that a clear demarcation of the Parliament precinct is considered by Parliament in order to facilitate easier accessibility to the Parliament precinct which also contributes to the achievement of SDG 10. The Committee further recommends the expeditious digitisation of all parliamentary Hansard. In terms of the parliamentary space and infrastructure, the Committee recommends that space should be provided for separate offices for the various parties represented in Parliament. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that the awareness and public engagement programmes for Parliament like the “Meet the Speaker” and “Parliament Bus” be revamped to include all Members of Parliament. This, Mr. Speaker, would open up more</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>1982 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 opportunities for Members of Parliament in engaging with the public and raise awareness on matters pertaining to the standard procedures and matters of this august Parliament. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity and urge the honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the contents of the Committees Report and show support for the motion that is before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have also received a list of speakers from the honourable Whips. To lead off the batting, honourable Maharaj will lead off, that is to be followed by the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ketan Lal and then the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor Prasad. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to give a short contribution on the Review of Parliament of the Republic of Fiji and before I give my remarks on the Report itself, I hope you are not holding a yellow card because we are discussing the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji and I hope to not be the first one to receive the card. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three arms of the State - the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. All three arms have different roles, and it is very important that independence is actually maintained whenever we are talking about these three Arms of the State. Mr. Speaker, I hope this is just a rumour that is floating around on social media about the Executive’s interference in the Judiciary. As I said, I just hope that it is a rumour and there is no fact to it but if there is any fact that Executive Ministers are interfering in the Judicial system then it is a very sad day for Fiji. Very poor. MR. SPEAKER.- I will be consulting the video analyst on the …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, on the same note now let me come to Parliament. The third arm which is the Legislature Department, if there is any kind of interference or is the Parliament totally independent? We need to maintain and ensure that Parliament is independent at all times. Mr. Speaker, this report is quite old: 2017-2018 so I would like to actually speak on some of the current issues that we actually faced and the way of how we can improve. I will be basically talking on my nine years of experience in this Parliament and the first recommendation that talks about gender equality, it was good to see when this Parliament was reinstated, we had a Speaker, a Secretary-General and \a Deputy Secretary-General who were females and that was a very good way to actually portray that gender equality and most of the management roles were handled by females in this Parliament. Mr. Speaker, the role of the Parliament as a legislator needs to be justified and whether we are justifying by reducing the number of weeks by four weeks of Parliament Sitting this year, is again something that can be questioned because that can actually reduce the performance of the Parliament and us being the scrutinisers as Members of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, we were offered laptops which crashed within weeks and these were new laptops, who procured it, what kind of quality assurance was there. It did not just happened to one Member, it happened to a couple of Members. Most of the Members refused to use these new bulky laptops. Is it okay for us to carry the bulky stuff with us?</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 1983</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, for one year the House Committee is yet to convene to look after the welfare of the Members. When is that going to happen, Mr. Speaker - a big question mark. Mr. Speaker, the Induction Programme happened after nine months. As I said we hear these rumours about Ministers interfering with the Judiciary - interference here interference there. While we had the Induction Programme for the MPs we need to understand that there are Members on the other side who are Ministers for the first time, they need to be made aware what their roles and responsibilities are as Ministers. Some of them think that they can do anything to everything if they are the Minister. (Laughter) Very poor Mr. Speaker. Maybe Parliament can take a lead role for the Induction of Ministers and Assistant Ministers on the other side. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, in terms of Business Cards, some of us are yet to receive our Business Cards. We are Members of Parliament and when we go around, people ask us for our Business Cards, we offer them our telephone numbers because we do not have a business card given by the Parliament. Mr. Speaker, on the Standing Order Review Committee, we agreed in one of the Sittings a few months ago that we will be convening, and we will allow the Standing Order Review Committee to sit to actually review the submission handed in by Opposition, that is yet to happen. Mr. Speaker, we are still waiting for the issue that we have raised with regards to the Membership of the Committees. We are still waiting for a response. It is almost a year now that we have requested for a clarification, and I do not know why the Secretary-General to Parliament’s Office is not giving a legal opinion on what we had requested to your office so that you can give a written report back to us. I believe my time is over, Mr. Speaker, I have a few more issues over here which I intend to discuss with you personally, Sir. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to commend the Committee for their Report and also to support your decision that we should try and table as many of these Reports as possible and also discipline ourselves to contributing within the time allocated to us. That, Mr. Speaker Sir, is based on a very dangerous assumption that we have all read the Report. Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to go straight to the recommendations of the Committee. In reviewing the Report, they have made these recommendations. One that they noted the achievements that have been made on Sustainable Development Goal 5, which is the efforts in promoting gender equality and empowerment, something that all parties represented here in Parliament I believe now, note and will promote. The Committee also commend the department for its achievements in SDG 10, in terms of physical accessibility and I commend the work that has already been done. When you come to my age you need those rails and I commend Parliament for the work that has already been taken and the</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1984 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 improvements. We will put in the same request for the lift on the other side of the New Wing of Parliament House which some time works and many times does not. The Committee, Mr. Speaker Sir, concluded by saying that they are happy with what our civil servants and members of our staff have done in the preparation of the Report in the submission and this Report was made for the period before COVID and later report that reporting on the period after COVID 19 provide a different stark reality of the time we go through. We commend the Report and the review by our Committee and I also support this Report before us. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I share the same sentiments as honourable Maharaj, that I do not get the first yellow card or red card since this is the last Parliament Sitting. I know this Report is an old one Sir, and in light of these findings I would like to support the recommendations put forth by the Standing Committee. We should continue with our efforts to promote gender equality and empowerment in building on the Department’s achievements on SDG 5, and we should expedite the measures to improve accessibility to the Parliament Complex including the installation of direction signs and other aids for persons with disability issues. We should also consider demarcating the Parliament precinct to facilitate easier accessibility thereby contributing to SDG 10. We should also privatize the digitalization of Parliament Hansard for improved accessibility and transparency which I understand is currently happening, but Mr Speaker Sir, we are still receiving papers for our daily Parliament debates and I think we should start digitalizing our everyday documents here as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Prime Minister also highlighted, the separate office that we also require for Parties and representatives of Parliament, should also provide enhanced efficiency of our parliamentary processes. We should revamp our awareness and public engaging programmes, such as “Meet the Speaker and Parliament Bus” to ensure inclusivity and wider public engagement. Before I end my contribution, I would like to express my disappointment that I am only given five minutes to contribute to this motion, and also that our voices as Members of Parliament, as legislators and as representatives of the people are being suppressed, and the number of weeks have been reduced all over this year. We understand this is a new Government and they are still learning, but it does not mean that the voices of people are suppressed. People have been raising issues to us and we were very excited to come last week and raise many issues after Diwali (a happy belated Diwali to everybody). I had raised all these issues but unfortunately, we had to reduce those issues to one week. Just a few days ago, we were informed that our contributions will now be reduced to 5 minutes only, that is not enough, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We represent hundreds and thousands of people in Fiji and 5 minutes per report is not enough. I think it is important that we are here to serve the people and not to be served. As legislators. we need to understand that we are here as 100 percent legislators. I understand, on the other side, they are playing dual roles, as legislators and as executive Members. But, here, when we are in Parliament, we are representing people as legislators, and I think it is important that we need to ensure that every voice is heard here and more time is given to each honourable Member to express themselves. Just adding on to what honourable Maharaj said about this laptop, this is the laptop that was given to us, it is bulky. I may be able to handle it, but some honourable Members will not be able to. It is bulky, and you cannot fit it in a laptop bag with its extra wires given. This costs somewhere around more than $5,000 and it does not work, and it did not work for a couple of months when it</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 1985 was given to us with regular breakdowns, so I am not sure if this technology worth $5,000 is even worth it, and we are using taxpayers’ money. I did raise the issue with the Secretary-General, asking her to give us something more efficient: iPads which were already given to Members during the 2014 Parliament as well, the former honourable Opposition Members might know. I think the former Opposition Members, they were also given much easier or accessible technologies such as the touchscreen laptops to do their work more efficiently. At the same time, I think we need to respect that this is the people’s Chamber and we are here to discuss about the people’s issues. MR. SPEAKER.- I thank you for those straight shooting comments you have made and I only hope that you were around when we were also given those laptops. (Laughter) In so far as suppression of your time to speak, I think I have made myself very clear as to the decision made by the Business Committee in how we could accommodate these volumes of reports coming back to this august Parliament. We just have to cut the coat according to the cloth available and say “Okay, two speakers from each side to speak before the Right of Reply is given.” I think we should be fair in doing that. I now offer the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable Professor Prasad. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by thanking you, Sir, because it is a breath of fresh air in this Parliament, and what we have seen over the last 10 months since we have been sitting in this Parliament. I was actually listening to honourable Maharaj. He was a bit more diplomatic, but then when I heard honourable Ketan Lal, it was an insult, not only to your high office, but an insult, a direct insult to his leader who is the Leader of the Opposition who was in the Business Committee where we agreed, Mr. Speaker, on how we are going to debate and discuss this Report. HON. K. K. LAL.- I address everyone. Everyone has the right to speak. This is the People’s Chamber. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- But let me, Mr. Speaker, also commend you for the independence, the confidence, the trust that you have placed in this Parliament and the way we have conducted ourselves as government, the resources that we have provided to the Opposition, they have forgotten, of course, he was not there but Honourable Maharaj, diplomatic as he was, forgot that in this very Chamber, when they were sitting this side, Mr. Speaker. HON. K. K. LAL.- Why are you complaining? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Now, they are complaining like little kids but when they were on this side. They bullied, …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hogwash. Talk to Mr. Speaker:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … they punched an honourable Member. Their Prime Minister punched an Opposition Member outside this Chamber, within the precincts of this Chamber and yet, Mr. Speaker, all these people yelling from the other side were sitting there and voted to suspend him for six months, that is what they did. As opposed to that the people of this country, Mr. Speaker, know the many things that have changed in the last ten years in this country. There is freedom, there is confidence.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1986 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 They, on the other side, even today, Mr. Speaker, will not admit it but under your leadership, under the leadership …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> … not under your leadership. Nobody wants to listen to you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … of the honourable Prime Minister and us in government in Parliament they actually feel free. They have entangled themselves out of the shackles and the dictatorship of two-men rule … MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … in this Parliament Mr. Speaker. They could not open their mouth properly, Mr. Speaker, and that is the difference in this Parliament today.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- No one wants to listen to you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What we are saying, Sir you have all the recommendations that are there, you have shown leadership, you have addressed a number of issues. The government on its part, has provided adequate resources to the Parliament to provide all those resources. The Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, under section 37(a) of the Financial Management Act, ideally, we would like the Parliament to still go further and have the independence of procurement, have the independence of managing their own budget. Right now, although there is a one-line budget, the Parliament is free, independent and determine how it is going to use that budget. That is what we have provided unlike what they were doing Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Parliament and you know Sir, too. You were also a victim of their dictatorship and I think, Mr. Speaker they should thank this government, the Honourable Prime Minister, they should thank you, Sir, and not come here and insult you, Sir, because …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> He understands, do not worry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … what you have shown in the last nine months is absolute independence and freedom of the Parliament. You have shown bipartisanship, Honourable Koya is not here with Honourable Gavoka, that is a bipartisan participation. The honourable Leader of the Opposition is going to be part of the delegation to 2023 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference COP28. You could never ever imagine in the last eight years… HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Never, ever! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- …that Bainimarama and Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum would ever agree to take an Opposition Member anywhere. That is the independence of Parliament, that is bipartisanship, that is the freedom, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have provided in this Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> What is your Point of Order?</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>1987 HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. He is referring to people who are not here. Why are you referring to people who are not here and do not have the opportunity to defend themselves? Stop making up stories. Talk about the people who are here. You focus on the issue, tell the truth and stop lying. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Sir, honourable Usamate does not even recognise that Bainimarama was the Prime Minister. That is why he is saying that I cannot even talk about it. HON. J. USAMATE.- You rubbishing him he is not here! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am not rubbishing him. I am just reminding you what you are doing. I am just telling you that you were part of it. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Government side, we assure Parliament, your good self, and all honourable Members on the other side that we will provide adequate resources to Parliament - to honourable Members whether they are in Opposition or Government, all the adequate resources for them to conduct their role as Members of Parliament, including the grants for Political Parties and the allowances for them to conduct their business and their activities as Members of Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to speak in reply. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Firstly, I thank those honourable Members who have spoken in regards to the Report that is before Parliament. Secondly, I thank the honourable Members of the Committee. On that note, there are no further comments from my side. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, for housekeeping purposes and for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting time, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move his suspension motion.</p></body>
