<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make</p><h4>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40, the:</h4><p>(1) Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; and</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1943 (2) Minister for i-Taukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage, and Arts. The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes. After the Minister, we will then invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the Statement for no more than 5 minutes. There will be no other debate. I now call on the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to deliver his Statement. Overplanted Pine HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen in the public gallery and those who are viewing the livestream from the comfort of their homes; good morning, ni sa bula vinaka and namaste. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a Statement on the Coalition Government’s stance through the Ministry of Forestry on the issue of overplanted pine areas which were transferred to Fiji Pine Corporation Limited and later Fiji Pine Limited. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the onset, I wish to simply define overplanted pine areas. These are areas that are planted by the Company outside of its lease boundary. Sir, please, allow me to provide a bit of background to enable us to fully appreciate the position of the Ministry on this important subject matter. Fiji Pine Limited is a public company incorporated in 1990 as part of the corporatisation of the Fiji Pine Commission to take over its assets, liabilities and obligations effective from 1 st January, 1991. The shareholders of the Company are: (1) Fiji Government which holds 99.8 percent shares; and (2) Fiji Pine Trust which holds the remaining shares. The Fiji Pine Trust which owns only 0.2 percent or 100,000 shares represent the pine landowners and was established under the Fiji Pine Act 1990 as part of the corporatisation of the Fiji Pine Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited has a total lease of 83,000 hectares of which 35,000 is currently stocked. Out of the total stocked areas of 35,000 hectares, 28,000 hectares is established in Viti Levu and 7,000 hectares in Vanua Levu. These areas are not surveyed and boundaries during the time of planting were determined based on certain characteristics of the area, for example, creeks, ridges, trees, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited commenced pine harvesting in 1987, at a time when the Fiji Pine Commission was managing the pine plantations. One of the main issues that arose during harvesting was the ownership of overplanted pines. The Fiji Pine Commission and iTaukei Lands Trust Board (ITLTB) resolved that: (1) Overplanted areas be given to landowners since the area was not leased as confirmed by (2) iTLTB; and for the case of double leasing, revenue generated from the harvesting of pine was to be equally shared between the Fiji Pine Commission and the other party leasing the same portion of land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2009, harvesting of the Vanua Levu resources commenced on a large scale after the construction of the Tropik Woods Products Limited. When the harvesting commenced, the company defaulted on its decision regarding overplanting which was implemented since 1987. Despite the ITLTB confirmation that the areas were overplanted, Fiji Pine Limited</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1944</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 continued harvesting overplanted areas, thus in the process breached its lease conditions. Mr. Speaker, so when the Coalition Government came into power, I announced in February 2023 that overplanted areas will be harvested by landowners and Fiji Pine Limited will be given first Preference to negotiate with the pine landowners on the purchasing of overplanted pine. This decision is based on the recognition of pine landowners as the most important stakeholders in the process. Once iTLTB, who is the custodian of all Native land, confirms that the subject area is not leased and overplanted, it is only right that the area be released to the landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is to be noted also that the landowners were unable to utilise those land for their farming and livelihoods due to the overplanted pine for which they neither received land lease or compensation of any sort. Since that landmark decision, a total of six overplanted areas that have been released to the landowners and harvested include: (1) Mataqali Lomate - Tiliva, Bua; (2) Mataqali Naicobo - Nawailevu; (3) Mataqali Nakakoso - Bua; (4) Mataqali Raracolo - Naruwai; (5) Mataqali Cake - Bua; and (6) Mataqali Naberei in Macuata. Total revenue generated from harvesting this overplanted area amounted to $560,000 and has been used by landowners for purchasing vehicles, tractors, outboard motors, building new houses, community halls (evacuation centres), maintenance of current houses, investment into financial institutions and tertiary education for landowning unit members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits to the landowners who have harvested their overplanted areas included not only additional revenue streams for their livelihood, but their harvested areas were replanted with pine and other native high value trees that can fetch greater returns in future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to mention some of the specific benefits incurred and accrued: (1) Two vehicles were purchased and a house for Mataqali Cake-Colo is in progress; (2) Mataqali Nakakoso invested $100,000 into the Unit Trust and also purchased a vehicle; (3) Mataqali Rara was able to pay $15,000 for school fees for Fiji School of Medicine students and also received $40,000 for the mataqali; (4) Mataqali Rara was able to invest in brushcutters and chainsaw to clear their land for agricultural purpose and cash for village commitments; and (5) Mataqali Cake invested in a fibreglass boat, as well as timber for building boats, to name a few. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is envisaged that after the harvesting of the first crop in Vanua Levu, all overplanted areas will be utilised, hence Fiji Pine Limited will not be facing similar issues again in the harvesting of subsequent crops, similar to Viti Levu, thus fostering better relations between FPL and landowners. Mr. Speaker Sir, these overplanted areas have been a contentious issue for decades, but this Government intends to address such issues and ensure that our people are treated fairly and compensated equitably. For the past 16 years, the previous Administration was unable to resolve this</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1945 issue. It allowed this action to continue, and Fiji Pine Limited took advantage of this, depriving landowners. It was advised that the issue was even brought to Parliament, but no action was taken. This action shall be no more, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I repeat - no more, enough is enough! The Fiji Pine Limited, together with Government as majority shareholder, needs to be seen as a company to drive Government’s mandate and the Coalition Government’s mandate is to ensure that a company that thrives due to landowners treats their landowners in a fair manner, with empathy and compassion to the communities, who depend on their forests for survival. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited has undertaken several developments in the past for the landowners and I hope that in the case of overplanted areas, they have the foresight and goodwill to continue engaging with these landowners effectively and meaningfully, and not be the cause of conflict which can be detrimental to a company which boasts compliance to the FSC standards. The Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Forestry, is addressing this issue of good governance with the Fiji Pine Board, so as to ensure that fairness and equity is addressed at all levels and with all stakeholders, especially, resource owners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to ensure that maximum benefits are received by resource owners in the course of implementing our projects and programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to deliver this Statement. May God bless Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu. “No More”, thank you honourable Minister. I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe not “No More” but we expect more from the honourable Minister. (Laughter) I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement. I wish to pay tribute to the late Vice- Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific, Professor Rajesh Chandra. We are, indeed, sad to hear of his passing. May I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he is a proud son of Fiji, who has served the nation and the region proudly as a renowned academic and administrator, and he has left behind a legacy, Sir, not only in Fiji but for the region as well. We remember him and, of course, we express our condolence as well to his family during these difficult times. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the Ministerial Statement. Again, as I have stated, maybe we expect more from the current Government, given the so many initiatives and improvements that we have made in Fiji Pine Limited over the last few years. Everyone in this august Parliament knows the history of Fiji Pine Limited and what they have been going through and it took good leadership. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- It took that visionary leadership, that integrity, particularly by Government, and also getting the right people to run Fiji Pine Limited, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fit for purpose Board of Directors, following the performance of the Board very closely. Mr. Speaker, Sir, overplanting is undeniable. I say that again, ‘overplanting is undeniable’, because of the technology available back then.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1946</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do about it? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the methodology to address this to benefit both, the landowners and Fiji Pine Group, is very important. Pine plantations were established more than 60 years ago. The technology to clearly demarcate boundaries was not existent in Fiji at the time then and, of course, we had these issues as well with mahogany. The availability of advanced technology in surveying is now available and it is helpful in clearly demarcating boundaries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government took on a very practical and pragmatic approach when it came to addressing overplanted pine. It is not that we did not do anything, let the honourable Minister be reminded that we took the initiative as well to resolve this issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we gave the Fiji Pine Group the first right of refusal. The key reason is because the resources used to plant the pine were public or taxpayers’ funds. Fiji Pine Limited then worked with the landowners to find an amicable solution which includes ensuring that the returns to the landowners are better than what the private contractors offered. And may I remind the honourable Minister that he needs to be careful on this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I know for a fact that landowners were exploited when it comes to harvesting of their resources, particularly on pine in Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Pine Limited offered the best returns to the landowners, at least, during our time. It used to be operating in the red, all the decades prior to the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- That changed when the Bainimarama Government came in and ensured that the Company was not only operating profitably, but importantly that it was giving greater returns to the landowners. Apart from the lease money and stumpages, the Bainimarama Government, for the first time in the Fiji Pine industry’s history, gave lease security bonus payments from 2013. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- These lease security bonus payments continue to this day and has amounted to over $30 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Many other benefits can be given to the resource owners such as employment opportunities, education assistance, socio-economic support for community and sports projects. These are the kinds of guarantees that Fiji Pine Limited could give to landowners of lands considered to be overplanted if they allowed Fiji Pine Limited to extend its lease formally to include the overplanted areas or to harvest the overplanted pines and give high returns. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us also be considerate of environmental factors. This is very, very critical, particularly, in this age of climate consciousness. Fiji Pine Limited has achieved forest certification which includes everything that will make the industry sustainable from economic, social and environmental perspectives. Private contractors may not fully understand the minimum environmental standards required during harvesting to minimise the impact on the environment. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of replanting. That is one of the key questions that I also wish to raise with the Ministry through the Minister. Fiji is over-reliant now on plantations,</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1947 particularly on mahogany and pine. So, in terms of sustainability in the long term, how are we going to address the replanting issue? Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a key question that we need to ask. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial, and I beg Government to consider the issue of overplanting pine holistically and not from a short-sighted and short-term perspective. MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn the House for tea. But before doing so, I would like the acknowledge those sitting in the gallery in today’s sitting. I have noticed the former Acting Commissioner of Police sitting there, together with Mr. Niko Raikuna from Sydney, who actually hails from Rewa. He has been in Sydney for quite some time, and he is sitting here. Thank you very much for spending some time with us. Honourable Members, I now adjourn Parliament for tea, and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.33 a.m.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1948</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call upon the Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts, to deliver his Statement. Great Council of Chiefs Progress Update HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Statement on the Great Council of Chiefs’ progress update. Standing before you in this august Parliament today, I am reminded of our solemn duty to steer the governance of our people with wisdom, foresight, and a deep respect for our tradition. The Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) has, for generations, not only been a cornerstone of the iTaukei governance, but a beacon of hope, stability and custodianship over our cherished customs and way of life. Mr. Speaker, the inception of the GCC in 1875 marked the beginning of the governance model. It uniquely blended traditional leadership with the demands of an evolving Fiji. Yet, recently, we have witnessed a sad absence in the stewardship of the GCC. This lapse has had wide-ranging implications through our nation and across all our communities. Mr. Speaker, the absence of this guiding institution has been felt in every village meeting, every provincial gathering and every national discourse on iTaukei affairs. Mr. Speaker, governance, in its truest form, is about continuity. The seamless integration of the past with the present, to forging a future that is respectful of its roots, yet adaptive to changes that improve all communities. Governance is not just about structures and laws, it is about the spirit in which they are enacted and enforced. It is about the confidence they instil in the people they serve. It was for this reason that the Coalition Government promised to restore the GCC. After coming into Office, Cabinet endorsed the review of the GCC in March this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to this Cabinet decision, my Ministry appointed a seven-member Review Team after an open competitive process, to review the GCC. Their work begun in April and concluded in July. The GCC Review Team embarked on an extensive journey of consultations, dialogue and discovery, reaching every Province within our island nation. They sought the wisdom of local communities, engaging in deep consultations with Fijians from all walks of life. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a profound commitment to inclusivity. The Team ensured that the voices of Fijians, from the bustling markets of towns and cities to the villages of our islands, was heard. Their mission was to weave together the diverse array of opinions into a coherent vision for the future of the GCC. The Team listened with respect to the hopes and concerns of the iTaukei people. It highly recognised that each Province holds a unique place in our cultural space. Other ethnic groups also gave their opinion. This was to ensure that they too had a part to play in this important process. Embracing all groups of Fijians ensured that the process was all-encompassing. Through this</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1949 comprehensive engagement, the Review Team demonstrated an unwavering dedication to this process. It was not only consultative, but also culturally vibrant and deeply democratic. It is thorough this exercise of nationwide engagement that underscored the unity and shared purpose of their mission towards a revitalised governance structure of the GCC. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comprehensive report by the Review Team is a testament to our collective resolve to fill this governance vacuum. The recommendations of the Review Team are not merely suggestions - they form a strategic framework to guide the revitalisation and modernisation of indigenous governance structures. The recommendations are also aligned with contemporary societal values and international governance standards. They also fully safeguard Fijian heritage and the empowering of iTaukei communities for the generations to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Review Team came up with eight recommendations as follows: (1) The GCC be independent and politically neutral. (2) The GCC be re-established as a Statutory Trust under an Act of Parliament. (3) The iTaukei Trust Fund be moved under the proposed GCC structure and grow its financial base. (4) The GCC be proactive in advocating, directing and oversight of iTaukei interests and aspirations. (5) The GCC maintains and strengthens its advisory function in nation building. (6) The GCC champions, strongly advocating and sets strategic direction on eight thematical areas, namely: (i) spiritual wellbeing and service centred; (ii) good governance and good leadership; (iii) economic empowerment; (iv) culture, tradition, heritage and resource ownership; (v) (vi) health and wellbeing; (vii) environment; and (viii) climate change. education; (7) That one out of the three seats per Province is allocated for women, with provisions for observer status for ordinary citizens and youth representatives. A non-voting seat to be allocated to Christian Churches. (8) That an implementation team be established. Mr. Speaker, the recommendations were endorsed by members of the GCC through the Vakaturaga Conference and the iTaukei Affairs Board. Cabinet has endorsed the recommendations in principle and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs will continue to update Cabinet on the progress. Mr. Speaker, establishing the Statutory Trust for the GCC is a process that requires careful consideration and time. Meanwhile, as an interim arrangement, the GCC will be reinstated under the existing iTaukei Affairs Act. This will be accompanied by necessary revisions to the iTaukei Trust Fund Act to facilitate this provisional measure. Mr. Speaker, this step will allow the reinstatement of the GCC functions while laying the groundwork for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Review Report. The process, if constantly reviewed, should produce a future where governance by the GCC is closely related with excellence, transparency and inclusivity. The future GCC with its revised statutory arrangements</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1950</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023 will become a beacon of trust and the champion of iTaukei issues across the eight thematic areas it is designed to develop. Mr. Speaker, the revised GCC is not only the custodian of our culture but a proactive participant in the modern governance landscape. It will fully uphold the principle of democracy, deeply honouring the sanctity of our tradition. Mr. Speaker, we are at a life changing juncture, where a determined decision needs to be made to reinstate the GCC. It is critical that we now move with determination to amend the iTaukei Affairs Act - to enshrine the GCC as an institution that epitomises the very essence of good governance for all races in Fiji. The proposed interim measure will catalyse the recommendations. It will set us on a path of genuine and sustainable governance reform. In implementing this reform, we are committing to a governance model that is reflective of our values, responsive to our needs, and resilient against the tests of time. implementation of the phased Mr. Speaker, the GCC must stand as a lighthouse - a beacon of hope, not just for the iTaukei, but for all Fijians, illuminating the path towards a future rich with promise and unity. It is important that this revised GCC transcends its historical roots, evolving into a symbol of national pride and collective aspiration for all Fijians. Its rebirth must foster a deep-seated confidence among all Fijians, assuring every citizen that it will serve as the custodian of tradition while steering the nation towards equitable progress and justice. Its role in nation-building must be evident, promoting social cohesion and championing issues that fully gel with the common aspirations of the people. Mr. Speaker, the revised GCC can secure its place not only in the annals of history but in the hearts of the people it is meant to serve. It is to be a testament to the nation’s resilience and its unwavering pursuit of a harmonious and prosperous future for all. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I call upon this Parliament to support the path laid up by the review. We need to trust the process. Our collective effort is required to breathe new life into the GCC. We will erase its memory as a relic of the past. One decision will change it into a living and thriving institution that guides us into a future of promise and prosperity. Mr. Speaker, allow me to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to every Fijian who played a role in our efforts towards the review of the Great Council of Chiefs. HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to reply to the Ministerial Statement. The honourable Minister has explained the rationale behind the work that is being done to revive the disestablished GCC. Some of the issues that he has pointed out here in terms of GCC being the body which looks after everything in relation to iTaukei, I must say at the outset that all of these things are enshrined in the Constitution. The Preamble of the Constitution states very specifically that the Constitution which is the supreme law of this country recognises the iTa ukei, recognises the ownership of their land, the unique culture which includes our chiefs and our respect for our chiefs, our customs and tradition and our language. So, in terms of the protection of things that are to do with iTaukei, they are enshrined in the Constitution and there are other aspects of this Constitution such as, for instance, Section 28 of the</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1951 Constitution which talks about land ownership, the sanctity of the ownership of that land. It also talks about Section 30 of the Constitution which allows for the payment of royalty, and it was only under the FijiFirst Government that for the first time that royalty was ever paid. I am trying to point out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that these things that we are talking about, the GCC and its role and we have a long history of working together, we are being brought up under the annals of the GCC we are very familiar with. However, I am just trying to point out that these things were actually promoted upfront. Even during our time in Government, despite without the GCC, we brought about equal distribution of leases for all the people in this country. All the time that we had GCC before, there was never equal distribution. We treated every iTaukei equally. This Government has now overturned that. They are saying that some iTaukei are more equal than others. We say, all iTaukei are equal, they should get equal distribution of leases. That is what I am talking about here. We came up with a concept also of the lease money that is given to children to be kept in trust for their development. I am not too sure what is happening on that particular front. But, Mr. Speaker Sir, one of the things I am a bit worried about, I am not too sure the legality of all that is taking place. We have already had a GCC convened in Bau earlier this year. On what grounds was that a legal undertaking? I have been told that there has been an amendment, there was an iTaukei regulation of May of this year. But I am not too sure on what grounds that regulation has any substance if the legislation that set this thing up, has been disestablished in the first place. So, if everything that has been done so far is illegal, then all the recommendations coming after this will also be illegal. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. The honourable Attorney-General is shaking his head, he has been making a lot of decisions that are illegal. He has brought a Bill before Parliament, the Heritage Bill, we found that it was flawed. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Government has the right to decide that it wants to do to the Great Council of Chiefs or not but let me just quote what the honourable Prime Minister has been saying this year, 26 th October, a report from FBC. “Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka states this includes the amendment to the iTaukei Affairs Act to provide for the re-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs.” If he is now talking about it in October, that means everything that you have done before this is all illegal. He is saying that there is still a need to change the laws. What is happening, honourable Attorney General? Your advice is wrong! What is happening here? Everything that you are now doing is illegal. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- This, I am quoting from the honourable Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is saying we have to do his administration, everything you have done so far is wrong. You have got to do something, you have got to do it legally, do it the right way. Stop abusing the laws of this country, stop abusing the people of this country, stop abusing the laws. That, Mr. Speaker, is my reply to this statement. Stop abusing it. MR. SPEAKER.- Well, you have really ignited some fire in there.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1952</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p></body>
