<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting of Parliament. It has been a while since we are able once more to continue with our programmes as already included in our calendar. I also welcome those who are joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. Report of the Emoluments Committee Honourable Members, as I had informed the Business Committee, I received a letter from the Chairperson of the Emoluments Committee, informing that the Committee will not table its report during this week’s sitting but at a later sitting of Parliament. For the information of all honourable Members, this is well within the parameters of the Resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11 th</p><p>20 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents</h4><p>1939 September, 2023. Time Limitation – Debate on Standing Committee Reports Honourable Members, at its sitting last Friday, the Business Committee unanimously agreed to impose time limitations during debates on the Standing Committee Reports and this is to ensure meaningful and efficient use of parliamentary time. You would have seen that there would be about five reports for debates per day from today through to Thursday. I trust that the Government and Opposition Whips will action the responsibility accordingly. Honourable Members, as further agreed by the Business Committee, the final decision on the times and the number of speakers will rest with the Speaker.</p></body>
