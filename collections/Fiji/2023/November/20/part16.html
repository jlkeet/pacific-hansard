<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – ITAUKEI TRUST FUND BOARD 2020 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – ITAUKEI TRUST FUND BOARD 2020 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report which was tabled on 30 th March, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board supports and promotes the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage as guided by the principles enshrined in the iTaukei Trust Fund Act. The core objective of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board is to help develop the management, leadership and entrepreneurial skills of the indigenous Fijians and Rotumans. Mr. Speaker, in 2020, the global pandemic significantly impacted returns on the Fund’s investment. For instance, the tourism sector was severely hit which affected, particularly, the Raddison Blu Resort. The Fund diversified its investment portfolio, including offshore investments which soften the gravity of COVID-19 impact on its financial performances and return on investments. The engagement of Mércer Investment of Australia to review its investment portfolio for the key objective was to review and to ensure the diversification of the Fund’s assets with managed risks and the delivery of inconsistent returns on investment. Mr. Speaker, the Fund’s car park space at the corner of Saint Fort and Stewart Street continue to deliver constant revenue annually. Tenants were given a rental concession of 25 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, for the year under review, the Fund’s net assets decreased from $325 million to $265 million. The Fund plans to diversify its revenue streams and is optimistic for a</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report 1975 better year ahead of recoveries by building resilience based on its diversified investment portfolio and staff to bring smarter value to its stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, the Committee is yet to receive the substantive response on the Standing Committee Report, as according to Standing Order 121(6)(b), which requires the agency to provide its responses within 21 days of receiving the report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floors is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list of speakers that have been provided by the honourable Whips: (1) Honourable N. T. Tuinaceva; (2) Hon. Minister for iTaukei Affairs (3) Honourable Koroilavesau (4) Hon. J. Usamate (5) Honourable M. S. N. Kamikamica HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before Parliament. The Report summarises the core objectives of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board to help develop the management, leadership and entrepreneurial skills of the indigenous Fijians and Rotumans. Mr. Speaker Sir, under item 3.0 on the key findings, the Report highlighted some projects funded by iTTFB. I am thankful with this brilliant idea of establishing a body like iTTFB some years ago, having part of its function to what I observed as powerful programmes that focus on the iTaukei cultural norms, traditions, language, kinship, traditional relationship and customs in general. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recommendations 4.1 says that the Sauvaki ni Vanua Programme be conducted in other Provinces. The Report simply put it as training on good governance and leadership for the i sausau vou. From the introduction of the programme in 2017 by the FijiFirst Government, it has slowly progressed across other Provinces as we have heard from the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs. Mr. Speaker Sir, it is only when one takes a very close look on the objectives and contents of the training to really appreciate why we need to develop our traditional leaders. In the Sauvaki ni Vanua Programme there are six components: (1) Rara Tabu Vakavanua – the vanua decision making forum. (2) Na i Tovo ni Veiliutaki Vakavanua – the vanua ethos and values and leadership approach. (3) Vakasavui ni Lewa Vakavanua – the vanua communication strategies, using of traditional ties to disseminate information within the vanua. (4) Na Cakacaka ni Lewa Vakavanua – the implementation of the decision through the solesolevaki. (5) Vakayagataki Vakavuku ni Yaubula – the sustainable management of resources. (6) Yadrayadravaki which touches on monitoring and awareness. Mr. Speaker, traditional leadership plays as a vital role in our community development, resilience and sustainability. The truth is, in my view, we often relegate traditional leadership to only things of the Vanua - cultural practices, ritual, including religion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is this fallacy that these issues and leadership about them cannot have any bearing on a country’s economic and sustainable development, but I want to say that this is not</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1976 Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 the case anymore. Worldwide, the importance of traditional knowledge and leadership is increasingly accepted in the highest forums such as the United Nations. I want to say that understanding this traditional leadership plays a vital role in our nation’s wellbeing is wisdom. Mr. Speaker, Sir, traditional leadership safeguards indigenous knowledge and identity. I want to make a point here, Sir, that I am not only referring to the iTaukei identity, but our multi-ethnic mix have their respective traditional ethnic indigenous identities. So, our multi-ethic identities and knowledge systems are as diverse as they are strong. Their knowledge system strengthens their communities and can potentially give strength to others. The most important message I would like to share, if communities are strong and resilient. The sum of multitude strong and resilient communities will result in having a resilient nation. So, it makes sense to empower our traditional leadership to use traditional knowledge and contextual solutions to build strong resilient communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is critical to understand that these traditional and indigenous leadership is like an anchor that keeps communities and the people rooted in resilience and strength to cope with the rapid change of time, for example, the climate change. They have done this a long time back, before there was any formal education around. They know changes and seasons and the kind of preparation that is needed, knowing who they are and using their indigenous knowledge to adapt and cope with climate change and its strength. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are things that contribute to our nation’s well-being instead of just enabling conditions that keeping people depend on Government to provide for their challenges, traditional leadership can lead their communities to a place of peace and finding solutions to their challenges. Traditional leaderships can help their communities navigate social changes, for example, our digitally transformed global world, the good and the bad it brings, its overwhelming changes are transforming the way communities and even family functions communicate or interact. The other examples are drug issues, the street dwelling problems we are currently facing, domestic violence, poverty and child trafficking or even pornographic matters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am trying to say is that the idea of trained traditional leaders like the sauvaki ni vanua, is a positive move for building resilient iTaukei communities. Sir, I want to challenge the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs to take cue and develop similar programmes for the traditional leaders of the various multi-ethnic groups under his Ministry. Six years ago, the FijiFirst Government started with the iTaukei communities and it is producing great results according to the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a brief on the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report that was tabled before the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on 30 th March this year. I take this time to thank the Committee for their time in scrutinising the Board’s 2020 Annual Report and providing us with their recommendations, which I am obligated to reply upon today. The year in review was enormously remembered for the COVID-19 pandemic. It took the world by surprise. Our normalcy was disrupted and restrictions were placed. The operations of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board were no exception to these disruptions. The global pandemic affected most of the Board’s planned projects. There was a dramatic decline on the return of our investment, in particular the Radisson Blu Resort in Nadi. To comply with the national safety measures proposed, the Trust Fund was able to continue its operations using hybrid method of operations both in office and virtually, all these efforts were taken into account to minimise disruptions and to extend our services as far as reasonably possible.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report 1977 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in the Report, three online projects were launched in the same period. These projects proved to be successful to this day. In the same period, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the strategic partner Sunshine and AMP Manufacturing Limited with the aim to establish a culture, art and commercial centre. The location of this project was to be in Vuda which is also known as the place where our forefathers first settled in when arriving into Fiji. The status of the project was that basic outline drawing and concept had been completed, a feasibility study was in progress however, COVID-19 had prevented the completion of the study. Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform this august House that for that same reason of COVID-19 and its prolonged delay which disrupted business operations, the strategic partner has pulled put from the project like many other business who are affected by COVID-19, the strategic partner have decided to take stock and consolidate its operations and focus more on their main business which is manufacturing. In the meantime, the Trust Fund will engage in search for an alternative site. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as has alluded earlier I am here to report on the recommendation put forth by the Committee. First the i Sauvaki ni Vanua Programme be conducted in other province. As of April this year I am pleased to inform this August House that the i Sauvaki ni Vanua Programme has been conducted in over seven province around the country with the province of Naitasiri held this year. Mr. Speaker, the program has proven to be a success in other seven provinces and the iTaukei Trust Fund Board is working towards facilitating the same program in the remainder of the provinces around Fiji. Secondly, the appointment of fund manager: the appointment of fund manager was on hold due to COVID-19 in 2020, however with the uplift of restriction and opening of borders, a board delegation visited Australia in April of this year to scout for a fund manager. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to report that a fund manager has been appointed in August this year. The third additional training program to be expanded to other provinces, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board through its entrepreneurship framework continue to offer training on areas such as entrepreneurship, business continuity, basic cooperative and social leadership training in province around the country. The board has also embarked in the developing of the resource owners entrepreneurship framework on that will better connect resource owners from productions to the market. Strategic alliance is being encouraged under the framework to ensure Product Development meets the expectations of the market and greater return flow back to the resource owners to help improve their wellbeing. Despite the restrictions, the team was able to train 100 community members representative from Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. The team will continue to deliver this training to assist iTaukei and Rotumans. Fourth, increasing on revenue and exploring other opportunities for investing. All investment opportunities are assessed with high level of due diligence to ensure the opportunities are in line with the investment policy of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board. Mr. Speaker, the team at the Trust Fund continue to actively seek viable investment opportunities, both locally and overseas for sustainable future for both iTaukei and Rotuma. I wish to assure Parliament that the iTaukei Trust Fund Board has continued to reach out to the most remote places in our beloved country providing awareness, initiating connecting and assisting resource owners in their bid to improve the livelihood of both the iTaukei and Rotumans. At the conclusion of this Annual Report, I must thank the board, management and staff of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board for the programmes and projects carried out during the year 2020. Despite</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1978 Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 the pandemic, the team conducted their role diligently in achieving key mandated outlay and subsequence results are noted to this day. I express my sincere gratitude to Parliament for this opportunity to provide a reply on the tabling of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board Annual Report 2020. Mr. Speaker, I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, may I remind each and every one of us that the Business Committee in its meeting last Friday had agreed that given the amount of reports coming into this august Parliament for this sitting and it being the last sitting, to have about five reports in a day and if it is possible to allow two speakers from each side before the Right of Reply is given again to the Chairperson of the Committee who is introducing the motion. However, it was also decided that the discretion be left with the honourable Speaker to decide on that. So far, I have noticed that the Opposition has given three speakers and the Government has got two. So, I will knuckle down on that one and allow only two from each side so we can cover all five in a day to complete all the reports that are supposed to be coming back from the Committees to Parliament. I hope each and every one of us will bear with that as time is of the essence here, it is quite important. Otherwise, we will not finish or we will go late right into the night to complete this. So, for that, the second speaker from the Opposition would be honourable Koroilavesau before I will ask the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica to finish off from the Government side and the Right of Reply given to the mover of the motion. I hope you will bear with us on that. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your indulgence, I would like to pass my time to honourable Usamate who is supposed to sum up from our side. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this particular Report shows the kind of work that is being done by the iTaukei Trust Fund Board in all things to do with the iTaukei because some of the times we sit in Parliament now and it seems that absolutely nothing was done during all those times. That seems to have been the rhetoric, but you see all the programme that are here, the i Sauvaki ni Vanua programme. I am glad to see that the honourable Minister has identified that seven provinces have carried out this successfully, though I would like to know what successful means because when you evaluate the training programme, there are various levels at which it is done. I am glad to see also that the appointment of the Fund Manager, that is progressing quite well. There are a number of things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my five minutes. One of the concerns that I have, I notice that the iTaukei Trust Fund now has a new programme called “ Na Solesau”. I am not too sure whether it was in place in 2020 but I think this is a critical programme for us. A lot of young iTaukei cannot speak the language. They speak in English all the time. It is very important that the funds that are available in order to preserve our authenticity as iTaukei, our young need to know the language. And if this particular programme, Na Solesau that I have been going through. I have used some of the YouTube, it is very important that this be propagated widely because in a lot of families now, people are not using the language correctly. That is the thing I wanted to highlight, in addition to all the recommendations that are here. The other thing, this issue of social leadership training – this is very important. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministers will now know, when you go for talanoa sessions, some of our iTaukei people have lost that ability to try and do things for themselves, I think in a lot of sense, they ask for everything. I remember once I commissioned a water project, at the end of the project they said, “Thank you Minister but can you replace the small taps, the $5 taps?” So, hopefully in this social leadership training, as the honourable Minister said, what he said, I think I should also tell you that. They have</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report-iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2020 Annual Report 1979 lost that capacity to be able to pull people together so they can do things for their own benefit and then Government can come in and help them. I think this is very important. So, this social leadership training, a lot of our traditional leadership seem to have lost it. They seem to have lost that capacity to build and bring people together. I think this is very important for us because at the end of the day, when you say, if there is a good organisation, there is a good village, there is a good yasana, it is because the leadership that is there. So, the social leadership training, Mr. Speaker is something that is very important. One good development that I have seen from the Trust Fund has been the development of the Tabua Shop. It is providing a big relief to people that need tabua, and I hope that the Ministry can continue to do that. The last thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want the Trust Fund to do well, it is very important they always have fit for purpose directors because I notice in Government now, they seem to be allocating directorships according to provincial basis. It is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put the right people in charge of all these organisations. Put fit for purpose directors who know what to do, know what to focus on and do not allocate them on the basis of provinces. MR. SPEAKER.- It brings me to the point honourable Members, what are we addressing here - leadership or traditional leadership? That is for you to decide. Quite different. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the Review Report for the iTaukei Trust Fund Board Annual Report. As part of my contribution, I just thought I would very quickly address some of the utterances by honourable Usamate. Firstly, this morning, he mentioned that GCC is not being required because the Constitution covered it. Sometimes I wonder whether the other side was actually tone-deaf. If you ask every single chief in Fiji, Sir, they will tell you, they wanted the GCC back; every single chief in Fiji that I have spoken to. I am not sure, sometimes the other side seem to be in another planet. Secondly, he talked about some of the discussions that the current GCC being illegal. Let us all accept, the GCC has never required a piece of legislation to be legal. We are formalising it as a structure within Government eventually Mr. Speaker, they know that, but to stand here and say that the GCC is illegal, is incorrect. He should withdraw that statement, Sir. Another one I wanted to quickly address, Mr. Speaker, was, he talked about concern for language. What hypocrisy, Mr. Speaker! He said, “we are concerned about the people losing their language - the youth.” They were the cause of it, Mr. Speaker. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- In this Chamber, Sir, what language was spoken to until we got to Parliament? What language? HON. J. USAMATE.- What language are you speaking? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Only one language! The iTaukei language was not spoken here, nor the Hindi language. Shame on you guys! Absolute shame! So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my small contribution in that regard is, to the people of Fiji, we have said that we were going to make changes in this country for the new Fiji and it is happening. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Absolute shame!</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>1980 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, my small contribution in that regard is, to the people of Fiji, we have said that we were going to make changes in this country for the new Fiji and it is happening. Sir, with confining the rest of my contribution, I would just like to very quickly talk about the iTaukei Trust Fund and particularly some of the great programmes it is undertaking, and the commitment from my Ministry particularly to continue working with them in terms of the area of promoting entrepreneurial spirit to communities and the vanua. Both the Ministry for Trade and the iTaukei Trust Fund Board have been working very closely in this regard. Through the MSME Fiji Unit and the Department of Co-operative Business, we are conducting business training across Fiji and I have to say that there is a heightened level of interest in the formation of co-operatives across our great land. That is something that we are really pushing hard in terms of trying to empower everyone in our country.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Microwave:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Some of the examples as one was mentioned in the Report was the Tikina of Matailobau Women’s Co-operative which is based in Nairukuruku, Naitasiri. The training there was aimed at entrepreneurial skills with the women Tikina of Matailobau in Naitasiri and with these newfound skills, they have been able to open their business hub which houses a grocery store, a hair salon, a sewing room and an area for screen printing. Services that used to be very difficult for the women of Matailobau to access, they could only access in urban areas are now accessible in Matailobau. These types of platforms are now available and will also enable artistic and innovative thinkers in Matailobau to continue to flourish. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that the iTaukei Trust Fund Board too has also been an advocate for s olesolevaki or the idea of co-operation which we are well aware of. The co-operative model, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know sits well within that particular solesolevaki model and my Ministry will continue to support the iTaukei Trust Fund Board and also the Ministry for iTaukei Affairs in order to ensure that we encourage this training across the country. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all honourable Members who contributed to the motion before Parliament. I have no further comments, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
