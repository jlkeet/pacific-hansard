TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Fijian Competition and Consumer</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2002 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 Commission 2018 -2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 4 th April, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Mr Speaker Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Committee tabled its Report of the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) 2018–2019 earlier this year in April. While deliberating, the Committee agreed that FCCC plays a significant role in ensuring that consumers in Fiji are protected from unfair and unethical market practices. It works with a vision to create a dynamic and competitive market in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was pleased to note the array of information that was available in the 2018– 019 Annual Report which helped during our deliberations. The FCCC had submitted a written submission which provided the Committee with a better understanding of the operations during the period under review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while reading through the analysis that was provided by FCCC, the Committee noted that the number of rentals complaints increased by 58 percent and recommended that further consultations are held with all stakeholders. It further noted that the three worst industries in terms of complaints received included automotive, construction and white goods with automotive comprising of 57 percent and made recommendations of the same. The 2018-2019 period was when FCCC had launched its 5-year strategic plan which was from the 2018–2023, given the important roles played by FCCC. The Committee looks forward to future reporting against its yearly business plan. MR. SPEAKER:- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Before offering the floor, I would like to inform you honourable Members that we have a list of speakers identified by the Whips that are here: (1) Hon. P. D. Kumar; (2) Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; and (3) Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic Development, National Planning &amp; Statistics. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak on this motion before Parliament. We all know the importance of FCCC in the marketplace. The crucial role of FCCC is promoting a fair and efficient market by addressing the imbalance that exists between businesses and also between consumers and businesses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCCC was established by folding up three institutions which were: Fair Trading Department, Prices &amp; Incomes Board and Commerce Commission. Over several years, FCCC has become a multi sectorial regulator, and if one analyses FCCC into detail, it is a very modern institution that deals with issues which is faced by businesses and consumers, and it tries to create that fair marketplace. That is really the intent of FCCC. The Committee made several recommendations to further protect unsuspecting consumers in the marketplace, and to improve the performance of FCCC when market practices and dynamics keep changing. During the period under review, FCCC received maximum complaints, as we have heard from the Chair of the Committee, and the complaints were on rental properties, automobiles, construction and white goods. It is disappointing to note that the hard work done by FCCC in coming up with a self-regulating Guideline for Landlord and Tenants in 2010 did not actually reduce the number of complaints.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 2003 We have just heard from the Chair again that the number of complaints increased in that particular year by 58 percent. The nature of complaints are such that sometimes it is very hard for the institutions to find solutions, for example, there is no law that governs how the bonds or deposits should be treated and how it should be refunded. Often the landlords will come up with the unjustified quotations and they will expect the tenants to pay for the wear and tear. We have also come across situations where landlords disconnect water and electricity supply, creating more problems, and on the other hand we have tenants who do not comply with the 30- day eviction notice. There are many other issues surrounding rental premises. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCCC, with its line Ministry has developed a draft Landlord and Tenants Bill, and the Committee was very well briefed on this particular Bill, which they are still trying to finalise. We do understand that from 2020 to early 2022, it was not possible to conduct public consultation because of COVID-19, and we just hope that FCCC will speed up finalising the Bill. We all know that the honourable Minister of Finance is not in favour of Rent Freeze Order. He announced in January 2023, the changes will be made by FCCC on rent increase restriction on Residential and Ground Rent Order 2021. We look forward to his further announcements now that December is around the corner and when the current Rent Freeze Order will expire. There are obvious reasons as to why he is not in support of using the Rent Freeze Order, however, we are waiting for the changes he will announce that will, depending upon what the content of the changes would be, it will allow landlords to change rent based on market rate. We do not know how consumers will manage an increase in rent at a time when VAT has gone up by 15 percent, and the promise to increase the minimum wage is yet to be realised. It is a catch-22 situation. What will happen to the inflation rate which is on the rise? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also commend FCCC for undertaking the investigation into Lagilagi Housing Project that assisted the Ministry of Economy at that time in refunding hundreds of Fijians who paid money to PCN with the hope of getting a flat. We also commend FCC for coming up with fixed penalty regulation which will streamline FCCC’s enforcement and provide a very quick solution to the consumers or small businesses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I hope the Government now realises that FCCC does its work independently without fear or favour. When they were in Opposition, they were never tired of complaining about the CEO and the work he does with his team to make the marketplace competitive, informed, fair and efficient. I hope all their conspiracy theories regarding FCCC have been put to rest, now that they are in Government, they are working closely with the CEO of FCCC and realise that, that is their job, it is not an easy one, it is a very difficult job. The CEO of FCCC has always lived up to it and he is still delivering at a time when the cost of living has risen and we often see him trying to educate the public through various press releases, through various other work that he does behind the scene to ensure that the marketplace is fair to the consumers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion that is before Parliament. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute as well to the FCCC Report for 2018-2019 and basically since coming into office, I have actually seen how tirelessly the FCCC works to monitor and regulate pricing in Fiji and protect our consumers from price gauging and unfair and dishonest practise. Let me assure Parliament that as you have probably worked out that currently we are noticing an escalation in scams around the country. I will be answering a question in that regard but let me assure Parliament that through this process, there will be a strengthening of laws regarding FCCC to ensure that such scams are not able to take foot in our country.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2004 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023 Before I delve into the Report, I would also like to congratulate the board of FCCC and the hardworking team for the Report. We do notice that they have tabled a strategic plan and as the Chair of the Committee has mentioned, they are looking forward to reports relative to the plan and it is encouraging to see a regulator that is strategic and forward looking in its endeavours. As mentioned as well by honourable Kumar which I quite agree, the increase in landlord and tenancy issues is still an on-going concern. I receive monthly reports from the Consumer Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and they are increasing. I agree that something needs to done about it. There was a technical working group established to look into it and there is a draft Bill already making its rounds. We will ensure that, that Bill makes its way into Parliament to try and ensure that both the landlord and the interest of the tenants are protected and maintained. Also, in terms of FCCC enforcement, like I mentioned, the 2010 FCCC Act is also under review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the aim to explore avenues to deter non-compliance amongst traders and businesses. I have heard some suggestions that perhaps in the past some businesses were given leeway, that we will ensure that we clamp down on to ensure that the regulation is adjudicated fairly and justly. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the introduction of increased VAT, the FCCC has been very actively monitoring pricing. The Report which was produced today by the honourable Minister for Finance is part of the active monitoring that is taking place and that is why, as the honourable Minister for Finance has alluded to, this side of the House has more calmer or sort of less panicky view of the price increases based particularly on the regular surveys that are being carried out by the FCCC which suggested there is also a lot of benefits accruing to the consumers through the price reductions. The biggest one that we saw lately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the reduction in butter prices. One of the other areas I think that FCCC is working on is to look at an alternate dispute resolution mechanism that tries to resolve consumer disputes or disputes generally. So that is another area that the FCCC will work upon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from my dealings with the FCCC they continue to uphold the Government’s commitment to ensuring consumer rights are protected. Where there is abuse that necessary action is taken to discourage unethical market practices and ensure that services are delivered at a high standard and with quality. With those comments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion on Report for the Review of the Standing Committee on the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission Annual Report of 2018 and 2019 on 4 th April, 2023. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I thank the honourable Members who have spoken before me. All I want to say in my introduction is, this is an important and an independent institution. Since 2016 a total budget of about $32 million has been provided to the organisation this year and the budget includes $4.8 million. I think both the honourable Premila Kumar and Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica have raised a number of issues answered some of the concerns. The couple of points, Mr. Speaker, that I want to make in relation to the issues raised by honourable Premila Kumar. I think she talked about the independence of FCCC. I agree with her. We once in the Opposition we know there were things being done. People were being forced to Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC). Officials were being forced to say things</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 2005 that they would not say otherwise. We are a Government that respects those independents do and what they do. The points she raised about the rent freeze. Mr. Speaker, I think she is right that a lot of things have happened. The rent freeze was put in place in 2007. You look at the economics of rent freeze anywhere in the world. It is an emergency. It is a one-off response. It has a time limit to address a spike or something unintended that happens. We have had this rent freeze for almost 15 years. In economics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand what we call perverse incentive. The unintended consequences of a particular policy if it is not reviewed. What has happened in the market is not only the quality of rental properties has gone down, but people have used all kinds of unscrupulous waste to increase the rent. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, what has happened is, all those new flats that have come into the market, because the rule is that, if you have a base rent, for example, if your rent was $400 in 2007, you cannot increase your rent, so what is happening is that, a lot of landlords have done all sorts of things. But what is also happening, the new ones that have come on the market, the landlords would raise the rent above the normal market rent that would normally be there. What happens is, the intention of the rent freeze was to help the tenants, in fact it has worked the opposite. The rents have just increased. So I think, what we were saying at the beginning of this year, Mr. Speaker is that it needs to be reviewed and FCCC of course will do its due diligence and look at the market, what is happening there and the Landlords and Tenants Agreement, that honourable Kamikamica talked about, of course that started in 2017 and that is something we need to look at. The contribution, Mr. Speaker, from honourable Sharma – I am thoroughly disappointed and saddened by the fact that they keep saying that we are trying to stop young people from saying things, that does not mean Mr. Speaker, that when you are young, you have the licence to say and lie about the facts that are there. He started by saying, there is no job, the economy is not doing well, investment is not taking place, but the data Mr. Speaker, hard data, official data shows otherwise. The Reserve Bank of Fiji has actually revised the initial forecast, Mr. Speaker, from 6 percent to 8 percent. All international organisations looking at our budget, appraised the budget, have looked at the growth forecast and all of them agree – the Internal Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank have all agreed that growth is on the right trajectory. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD - Other figures Mr. Speaker, ANZ also agrees with the growth figures, except they got it wrong with the inflation forecast. Mr. Speaker, the other point that he made, this is FNPF data. Formal sector wages in 2023, between January to August increased by 14 percent relative to 2020, Mr. Speaker. It increased! The other formal sector wages increased by 14 percent, relative to the same period in 2019. What it shows, Mr. Speaker, is that there are a lot of jobs, there are a lot of vacancies – some arising out of people leaving, but also there is job growth. The President of the Suva Retailers Association called out publicly and said if you are at home and you are looking for a job, please come because we need people. The Tourism Industry, the numbers have increased beyond 2019. The wages and salaries there have increased, Mr. Speaker.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2006 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 20 th Nov., 2023</p></body>
