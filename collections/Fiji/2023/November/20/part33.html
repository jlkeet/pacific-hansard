<body><h3>(HON. L.D. TABUYA)</h3><h4>(HON. L.D. TABUYA)</h4><p>Response to the question by honourable H. Chand is as follows: The Social Pension Scheme or in short SPS is meant for senior citizens in Fiji who have attained the age of 65 years and above, with no source of income, are not recipients of any other Government Pension, Ex Serviceman Funds, FNPF or any other superannuation. Some significant changes have been made to the Programme in this fiscal year, which are: • • Recipients who are above 70 years received a 25 percent increase to their allowance which equates to $125 per month. Recipients between the ages 65-69 years received a 15 percent increase to their allowance which equates to $115 per month. Inclusion of 1,500 FNPF pensioners who were deprived of their financial benefits by the former administration 2011. We have so far onboarded 314 members and they receive $115 or $125 per month depending on their age. To accommodate the above changes, Government has allocated budget of $78.2 million which is an increase of $23.2 million from last Fiscal Year. I would like to inform this August house that currently there 31,250 individuals receiving $115 per month while 21,700 are receiving $125 per month.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 157/2023 Tabled on Monday, 20 th November, 2023 by the Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport, honourable Ro F.
