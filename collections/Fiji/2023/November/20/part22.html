<body><h3>HON. R.R. SHARMA - $5.00.</h3><h4>HON. R.R. SHARMA - $5.00.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> He comes here and completely lies, lies overboard, says there are no jobs. These are FNPF figures, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- No confidence:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Now he is talking about confidence, when every business sector, when we have meetings, you see the number of people who come, who say that they are now free, even the FijiFirst supporters say they are free now. They are free, they want to invest, they want to work with the Government. It is actually quite shameful that somebody who can contribute more positively, come up with some facts, do some research, comes in this august Parliament and lies just like he is talking to people on the street. This is a Parliament, Mr. Speaker, when you come here and say there is no job growth, for God’s sake, use some figures because this is the kind of lies and misinformation that they are spreading out there in the community. They are going there and lying.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You are lying:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Shameful! I urge the honourable Member, I urge him, he has got a bright future in politics. He can have a bright future, he has got potential, I can see that, but he is just being carried away into the politics of the past of what they are saying. HON. J. USAMATE.- Stick to the report … MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I want to say to the people of this country, yes, we understand. This morning, I pointed out a list of items. The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica talked about the prices. Yes, some prices have gone up and I explained the inflation rate and how it is calculated, what is happening. I also explained what is happening, what is the transmission mechanism of what is happening to imports.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Time’s up.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The people are suffering:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Please, come into this Parliament with some dignity and respect on facts and what you say because we are telling the people of this country and the people of this country are watching and saying - what, there is no jobs when employers are desperate to get people to come and work for them? MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution towards the debate. I am sure that a lot of these issues that they have raised will be an added value to how the Government is going to improve the performance of the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission. I have no further comments to make.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>20 th Nov., 2023 Review Report – FCCC 2018-2019 Annual Report 2007 Question put. Motion agreed to. MR.
