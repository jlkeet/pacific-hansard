<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p>Empowering Youth for a Prosperous Future in Fiji HON. K. K. LAL.- Honourable Members, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our nation, known for its vibrant culture and warm-hearted people, has always been blessed with an abundance of youthful energy and potential. It is these very youths that represent the future of our nation; a future we all cherish and work tirelessly to build. For this week Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have gathered here to deliberate, discuss and make decisions that will shape our beloved nation. The issues we have grappled with have been many and</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2323 the debates have been fierce, but today as we draw this parliamentary week to a close, I want to focus on a subject that I believe should be at the forefront of our political discourse - the empowerment of our youth for a prosperous future in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we discuss this critical issue, I have to draw our attention to the challenges that impede the realisation of this mission, challenges that demand our immediate attention and collective efforts. One of the most glaring issues is the state of education in our country. The promise of free education is a big Election promise of the Coalition Government’s agenda seems to have vanished into thin air. It is disheartening Mr. Speaker, Sir, to note that students are being burdened with the weight of fees required to pay before they can even sit for their exams in certain tertiary programmes. This not only contradicts the commitment made by the Coalition Government but also places an unjust barrier to their educational pursuits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, equally concerning is the decline in youth-focused policies by the Coalition Government. It appears that the ship of our nation the Government is sailing without a compass lacking a clear direction for Fiji’s youths. The lack for new initiatives and projects means a less employment opportunities for our young people further adding to the challenges they face in building a prosperous future including trying to overcome the high cost of living due to the increase in VAT. Moreover, the recent Government reshuffle and decisions taken therein have left the nation in a state of confusion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Only you are confused:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.- Such actions including the lack of transparency surrounding them erode the trust and faith that our young people place in the Government:</span> We cannot afford to have a generation unsure about the government’s decisions shaping their future.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, another cause for concern is the regular breach of the Constitution by the Coalition Government. The very foundation that guarantees the rights of our citizens is being questioned leaving our youth wondering about transparency, democracy that was promised to them before Elections Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is crucial that the Coalition Government must uphold the principles enshrined in our 2013 Constitution to protect the rights of the younger generation and preserve the democratic values we hold dear. I also want to put on record Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Grace Road workers especially the female workers who were harassed by the police, there are videos that were viral on social media. None of the Coalition Government Ministers, even the Home Affairs Minister did not even make a comment about how the Grace Road workers were harassed. I also note that in today’s Order Paper, honourable Ratu Rakuita (my OB from Savusavu) is also making a Statement on the Adherence of Rule of Law. It is quite surprising when you talk about rule of law and something else is happening on the other side as well. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, the Koreans were youth as well? You mentioned the Koreans or something.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> They are Grace Road workers, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Are they youth?</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2324 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 HON. K. K. LAL.- Yes Sir, some of our youth workers are working in that company, they were concerned how the Grace Road workers were treated. MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we continue to breach the 2013 Constitution, it is setting a bad example to our younger Fijians. As a saying goes in iTaukei “ni sa vuvu na vuna sa na vuvu kece mai na uciwai ”. MR. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat that again. HON. K. K. LAL.- Sorry, Sir? MR. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat that again. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Time is up:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, “ ni sa vuvu na vuna sa na vuvu kece mai na uciwai ”.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is disheartening to note that during times of crisis such as cyclone affecting our nation, some Ministers was seemingly preoccupied with activities that are not aligned with their responsibilities, Like drinking grog while our Fijian police officers and our fellow Fijians... (Chorus of interjections) HON. K. K. LAL.-... were grappling with the cyclone and the …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Nonsense:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.-... aftermath and during the gust winds of TC Mal that was affecting Fiji:</span> Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the absence of the Prime Minister during critical moments raises questions about this Government’s priorities and commitment to the wellbeing of our nation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The Minister is there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.:</span> While youths and SMEs hold immense promise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that some may overlook or underestimate their contributions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Monday the honourable Minister for Finance &amp; Deputy Prime Minister stood up in this same august Parliament and responded to a honourable Member, and I quote: “I do not do the BBQ from the roadside like you.” Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir,... (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- ... he has withdrawn that statement:</span></p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2325 MR. SPEAKER.- He has withdrawn that. They have withdrawn it, honourable Member. No need to bring it back.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LA.:</span> Noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What he quoted is already resolved. He should not quote it again. He should clearly state that I have withdrawn. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- What is your Point of Order? MR. SPEAKER.- I have already... HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- … already explained. Are your deaf or what? MR. SPEAKER.- It has been taken care of. So, they have withdrawn those remarks and please do not reignite the fire again. HON. K. K. LAL.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that comment was withdrawn by the Minister for Finance and Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Minister for Finance that he should recognise and promote the invaluable role that these BBQ stalls played during night life in urban areas and in our economy. Some of them are young people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I normally go and buy BBQs from them as well. These are people trying to make best living, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and create better life for them and their families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that we are at a crossroad, faced with challenges that demand our attention and resolute action. The promises made to our youth, especially in the realm of education, must not be hollow words but tangible commitments that uplift the aspirations of every Fijian. It is time for the Government to reflect on its course and re-evaluate its priorities for the collective wellbeing of our young generation. To reignite the flame, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of hope for our young people, the Coalition Government must reaffirm its commitment to free education ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder the academic pursuits of students and the young people. To the honourable Minister for Finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a stagnant economy leads to a stagnant future, and we cannot afford to let our young minds remain idle and please Minister for Employment, Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Minister of Finance, reduce your overseas travels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the Government I say this “FijiFirst has left you with a modern Fiji” Our young people deserve a Government like FijiFirst that they can trust and believe in. One that stands firm on the principles of democracy and transparency as enshrined in our 2013 Constitution just how FijiFirst followed it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we navigate the challenges before us, the Coalition Government must remember that the true measure of a nation’s strength lies in the wellbeing and the aspirations of the young people. I demand that the Coalition Government gets back on its track to work tirelessly for the future of our young people and to craft policies and initiatives that pave the way for a prosperous and promising tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a future that irrespective if I am an Indo-Fijian or not, I am considered a Fijian under the 2013 Constitution. That is the modern Fiji that the Bainimarama Government and</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2326 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 the FijiFirst Government has definitely. In the same verse of honourable Tabuya - ciqoma, tiloma qai mokota ena marau. MR. SPEAKER.- I now invite honourable Lynda Tabuya. She is standing in for the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports who is being displaced at this point in time. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to respond to the End of Week Statement by my colleague, honourable Ketan Lal. As the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection in Fiji, I do stand before you today to address this critical issue that resonates deeply within the fabric of our nation’s future - the empowerment of our youth for a prosperous tomorrow. The youth of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, represent the lifeblood of our nation - holding the promise and potential to drive our economy, innovate industries and shape the social landscape of our country. However, Mr. Speaker, their journey towards success is often impeded by various challenges, hindering their ability to fully realise their potential. The need to empower youth is a critical issue for the Coalition Government. In the last 10 months, Mr. Speaker, since we have come into Government, youth focussed policies have been implemented in various Ministries, mostly focussed on youth economic empowerment. The Ministry of Youth, through the reopening of our Youth Training Centres in rural and maritime areas which were closed by the previous Government, is a welcome initiative, as well as the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs stepping up their training opportunities in Nadave, and education and training Initiatives by the Ministry of Education through the Fiji National University. Mr. Speaker, as you have heard in the Parliament previously, the offer made to our young people living in informal and squatter settlements and those who are unemployed or are on the streets received training opportunities through the Fiji National University and they continue to upskill in their stages of training. Just this morning, Mr. Speaker, Pacific Polytech commenced its free courses in their location in Nabua - courses in Carpentry, Joinery, Plumbing, Auto Penal, Mechanics, Engineering, Tourism and Hospitality. Mr. Speaker, I visited Pacific Polytech and met with Dr. Ganesh Chand and his team, as well as the students currently enrolled there. It was an atmosphere of smiles, joy, enthusiasm and hope. As young people, they are mostly from informal and squatter settlements in the Suva-Nausori corridor. Young single mums and dads included with an eagerness to learn and eagerness to be productive and eagerness to be empowered, and the eagerness and hope for the future. Mr. Speaker, a dignity in their life, learning the value of work. This is what this Government is committed to. Mr. Speaker, we all know the previous Government that stopped Pacific Polytech from opening, did not give them the funding to open. For a number of years, building the complexes that were never used around the country. They closed the vocational colleges, they closed the Youth Centres without our youth being empowered. That was the legacy of the previous Government, Mr. Speaker. So, honourable Ketan Lal, who has disappeared and has left the Chambers, and is talking about youth focussed policies … HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Call him, call him!</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2327 HON. L. D. TABUYA.- …he is obviously new in Parliament. He is new to this Chambers, but he should just look left and right, ask his leader, ask his colleagues, what did they do to bring youth focussed policies? What did they do to empower our youth? This is their legacy, Mr. Speaker, this is their legacy, and I will remind them of this. We have about 800 to 3,000 young people on the social welfare system who should not be on it. They have been there for years. Social welfare is supposed to be for temporary shocks, not for years. We are talking about three years, four years or five years of young people in the system. What has their government done to graduate them out of the system? What happened to the Welfare Graduate Programme that is a mandate for the Ministry of Women and Social Protection, that they should be graduated out of? Nothing done, Mr. Speaker, no programmes. Yes, they had the Jobs for Nature, but it was a half attempt, just to buffer the big loans that they were getting from the World Bank. It was just sort of a concessional or consolation prize, they call it, just to make it look like they are engaging young people and women. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these were not sustainable projects. We need to get into sustainable projects for our young people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have the legacy of wrecking up the largest burden for youth in the history of Fiji. They were prepared to give $650 million to our youth in terms of Tertiary Scholarship Loans. What did this Government do – the Coalition Government? We have removed and forgiven this debt. That is empowering. We have removed this debt, we are empowering our youth to move forward without a debt. So, when they start working, they can actually afford to buy a house, they can afford to sustain and support their families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to address what honourable Ketan Lal said. I want to congratulate him for being a youth MP in Parliament. I want to congratulate honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Rinesh Sharma for making it into Parliament as youth Members And, of course, honourable Aliki Bia, from our area of New Town. Congratulations as new MPs</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- That side no youth:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- But, Mr. Speaker, I fail to see how grogging, and he has mentioned “grogging” of honourable Members on this side has to do with this topic of youth empowerment. In fact, the kava industry is thriving because of youth, so there is no connection there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he really do his homework and ask his leaders and colleagues, what did they do? The youth were not a priority for the FijiFirst Government in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker. They have created a welfare state for our young people. We want to graduate our youth from welfare to well-being, from poverty to productivity, and that is the commitment of this Coalition Government, we are doing it and we will continue to do it. MR. SPEAKER.- No running commentary and no debate. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this relevant topic. Standing Order 62(4)(a) – Prohibited references: “Offensive words against a Parliament or another Member.” The newly appointed Leader of the Government in Business looked at me and referred to me and said, “Are you deaf, or what?” I request you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow him to withdraw the statement because we follow the rules you set in this Parliament, and when we raise a Point of Order, we quote the number</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2328 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 and reference, then we raise the matter.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> It’s too late.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R. R. SHARMA.:</span> It’s not too late, we are still on the matter. Please, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he can withdraw his statement. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, would you like to withdraw those comments? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it was supposed to be raised immediately after that, but in respect of the youth, I withdraw that and I know that he is not deaf. (Laughter) Maintaining Safety on Public Transport HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a comment to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, whenever we were in Government…. MR. SPEAKER.- Is that part of your End of Week Statement?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me move on.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this morning as I drove into Parliament from Nakasi and as I approached the Laqere Bridge, my mind thought back to 22 nd January, 1973. I was then 11 years old, attending what was then called the Kalabu Fijian School. It was a Sunday after midday, if I recall correctly, and there was a loud noise from the King’s Road. Soon after this there was an intense commotion filtering through our settlement in Wakanisila and people started running down the gravel road to the then two-lane Laqere Bridge and it was the most traumatic site; a collision of two buses just before the old Laqere Bridge from the Nausori end, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Tui Davuilevu bus, this bus company is no longer with us, an old wooden bus was coming down from Nausori. It was full of women and children who had been celebrating a wedding, in a celebratory mode, they were singing, playing instruments in the bus. They were on their way to Suva Point to put flowers into the seas as part of the wedding rituals that they have just been to. It was an old wooden bus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it was a time of joy for everyone on that bus. Coming in the opposite direction was a Chieftain bus that was used by the tourists. There were no passengers on board, only the driver was on board, and it was a steel structured bus. It was a huge tragedy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 15 people on that wooden Tui Davuilevu bus lost their lives there and one more passed away the next day; 16 lives were lost. The impact of this on the families was intense, catastrophic and immense. The driver of the Chieftain bus could be later taken to task for this disaster and to my mind, as I reflect back, two major things contributed to that disaster. First of all, driver carelessness, the way that driver drove the bus; and secondly, the condition in which the other bus was. That traffic accident is forever etched in my memory. It is a graphic reminder and when I think of safety on public transport, those are the memories that come back and for a long time in our</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2329 area there in Wakanisila and Laqere, we were always haunted. People said that that end of the bridge used to be haunted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, public transport includes buses, taxis, minibuses, carriers and rental cars and already this year we have had 73 fatalities on the roads, 12 of these were from public service vehicles. Some of the data shared by honourable Tuinaceva last night was quite shocking and I think, for us, demonstrates another crisis that we are in. He told us last night that until last week, there had been 72 deaths compared to 38 the same period last year - a 90 percent increase, almost doubled. I think that is a crisis for us, something that we really have to address. The other data that he shared, 80 percent of accidents are caused by overspeeding, 70 percent of deaths are caused by overspeeding, and in November alone of this year, within two weeks, there have been 161 accidents and eight fatalities. For the buses, in October of this year (2023), there have been four accidents involving buses and three of these were fatal where people passed away and all of these happened just within 10 days. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be speaking a lot more for the rest of my speech and using the bus industry as a proxy for the whole of the public transport sector. But there are a number of factors that are affecting this reduction in safety on public transport, and one is the condition of buses. The conditions of buses that we have and you can use that for condition of the minibuses, condition of rental cars and taxis, et cetera. Already, we have had four cases of burning of buses where buses stopped, people have to jump out because it starts burning. Obviously, there are some defects with the buses themselves that would have been the cause of burning. Everyday around Fiji, there must be, at least, 10 bus breakdowns, where buses have to stop, people have to get out, they have to call another bus to put people on board. Obviously, there is something wrong with those buses that led to those bus breakdowns. That is hinting at the state of some buses, not all buses. We can see a lot of good buses around Fiji. When I was a Minister, I used to ride around in the black car that you are now enjoying, but this year, I have had the luxury and the time to be able to every now and then ride buses back to Nakasi, or from Nakasi to here. I can tell you that riding on these public buses, there is a lot of extreme discomfort. I once sat on a bus, there was place for two people, one person was sitting there and for me when I sat on the seat only one quarter of me could fit, so I had to turn this way and sit. It is extremely discomforting riding in our buses today. Something happened, even the buses have gone smaller, or our people have gone much bigger or both, but it is extremely uncomfortable. I have been riding buses this year and I can tell you, there is a lot of overcrowding. The condition of these buses are such, the way people are crammed together, if there was an accident, there would be a lot of injuries and even possibly fatalities. Land Transport Authority (LTA) has quality assurance processes for buses, and this is designed to ensure that the quality of buses are maintained after they have received their fitness certificate. They normally do this twice a year, so it is very important for us to make sure that the soundness of the buses, that these quality assurance mechanisms are being implemented well. These mechanisms look into fleet management, they have daily checks. A big question for us is, how sure are we that it is being done well because all those indicators of buses breaking down and about 30 percent of buses in Fiji are more than 20 years old. When you have very old buses, you cannot get the replacement parts, what they do, they modify parts to put that in and the quality of those modified parts – we do not know. Maybe that is part of the issue too.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2330 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the reasons that we introduced e-ticketing was to get rid of the leakage that was happening in the bus industry so that the companies could increase their income and perhaps, buy new buses. I think we have seen that over the past few years, we have seen quite a number of new buses that are on the roads; much safer and better for the people who travel on them. So, the whole idea of putting the e-ticketing is to allow the buses to save 30 percent of their income that used to be leakage and use this for re-fleeting of the buses in Fiji. The Government also is trying to help bus companies introduce fuel rebates and reduction in duty. All of these, trying to encourage bus companies to get new buses. The whole idea of buses running on our roads, need to be in good condition so we can maintain the safety of the people who travel in these buses all over Fiji. The second major criteria that I think is an issue here is driving skills and driving standards. As I have said in the past, most of the fatalities are because of overspeeding and it seems we have put in some good measures. We have got the defensive driving training programme. You can get training, you can get certification, but it seems this is not working so well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last major accident that we had at Lomawai, I attended the funeral and some of the people working in the industry were saying that the bus was travelling at around 90 kilometres per hour when public service vehicles are supposed to be travelling at 60 kilometres per hour. So that is one issue, driver standards and how they drive and how they do their business. Third might be the road conditions, there is a bumper sticker going around - as you see me weaving, do not think I am drunk, no I am just avoiding the potholes. The current Minister and I know that it is not easy to address potholes, but it is now his responsibility to be able to fix those potholes. They can be a major consideration. One of the other things that we need to do well is the road safety audits. We know where the black spots are, these black spots need to be audited, to see what can be done to fix those areas so that accidents can be reduced. I just have a number of suggestions. I will not talk about policing, that was discussed at length last night, but I think I still have a number of suggestions that we should consider. First, is to strengthen the quality assurance of buses, especially the old ones. The new ones are much better. How can we strengthen that quality assurance with the system that we currently have? Sometimes when you have a very old bus and when they come for fitness, they take out the old tyres and all the old stuff and they put on the new stuff. It goes in for fitness, comes back and maybe they take out the new tyres and fit the old things back on. How do we control that much better? We have systems and processes in place. MR. SPEAKER.- You are very good with your body language, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> It is just the meke, Sir.</p><p>(Laughter) And how also can we introduce this quality assurance mechanisms in other forms of public transport - carriers, taxis, rental cars so we can assure the public that when you travel in these public vessels that you are safe. Addressing the certification and monitoring of all PSV drivers, introduction of mobile</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2331 camera, strengthen the road safety audits and consider whether a reallocation of roads might be necessary to address this crisis. Last point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should LTA release some power to other agencies …. MR. SPEAKER.- You have reached your end of time, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you for the opportunity:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the End of Week Statement which definitely is an issue:</span> There is no doubt that maintaining the safety of all those on our roads is a critical concern, as I have already alluded to. Safety is everyone’s responsibility. Sir, to put things in perspective, Fiji has a population of over 900,000 and the vehicle population is 144,000 with more than 14,000 PSV registered vehicles, and public transport make up 99.83 percent. There are more than 320,000 registered drivers, with 9 classifications of driver licensing categories. Of these 320,000, approximately 50,000 are registered PSV drivers, including taxis, carriers, mini-buses and omni-buses. There are only 95 enforcement officers in LTA nationwide that assist the Police. Let me repeat that, there are only 95 enforcement officers and the Coalition Government understands this, and we have been working to address this in the financial year. Land Transport Authority is working to recruit more officers. Unfortunately, in the last Government, 104 positions and 33 of which were for public transport officers, and enforcement officers were shelved by LTA. We are working on rebuilding this as a priority. With regard to road safety and the LTA and police working together, we can only do so much and the onus is on the creation of a safety conscious environment. So if we look at the ratio, currently, it is one LTA enforcement officer to 3,400 drivers and 1,500 vehicles. Yes, there has been a spike in road deaths, and LTA is pleading with members of the public to slow down and adhere to road rules. That is just the simple message which LTA is emphasising now, and working with our stakeholders. The honourable Member had raised speed cameras and other devices to assist us. We are working with our development partners right now, in terms of having speed cameras and better equipment for LTA and our traffic officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst PSV represents a small fraction of the overall vehicle population, it is true that a lot of the accidents involve PSVs. Addressing this is a critical component of what the LTA is doing now. We have commenced rigorous, for example, for rentals, some of these vehicles involved in accidents have written-off, rigorous audits, and we have audited 163 rental companies out of a total of 412. The honourable Member had mentioned the Quality Assurance Systems (QAMs) and over the last four months, 18 out of 61 bus companies underwent rigorous QAMs. These are some of the measures, which we are currently undertaking. I would like to also raise a few points regarding the freeze on the Public Service Vehicle permits, which we feel has led to sub-standard services given the rise of monopolistic behaviour. In terms of the sale of PSV permits, that is something also, which is an issue because the sale or the transfer of those permits have not undergone the rigorous assessments which we normally do for those who are applying for new permits. So, the reduction of the minimum age of PSV drivers, this was done, I think to curb the outward movement of bus drivers. In 2017 again, a lot of those who have been involved in bus accidents have been our young bus drivers. So, we are relooking at that criteria.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2332 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 The Coalition Government has started to address the above anomalies and we will continue to do so. We are working closely in conjunction with other stakeholders including the police in terms of having nationwide campaign throughout this holiday period which you will notice in terms of addressing the situation as highlighted by honourable Usamate. With those words, Sir, I note, and with these issues raised, we will be working rigorously on addressing those. Best Practices for Cattle Farming in Fiji HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to present to this august Parliament my End of the Week Statement which will be focusing on Best Practices for Cattle Farming here in Fiji. Cattle is a source of high-quality protein, both from milk and meat. It is of very high demand here in Fiji, and also around the world. Even non-beef-consuming nations, like India are amongst the top producers vying for export markets, due to the increasing worldwide demand on cattle. Cattle provides us with: • Beef and milk; • Hides and Leather; • Bi-products (livestock feed and fertiliser); • Employment and source of revenue; • Labour for control of weeds under tree cropping system; • Power for animal drawn implements; • Energy from methane digestion; and • Meeting our traditional and religious obligations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, cattle farming in Fiji is widely believed to have been introduced by Christian missionaries in the early 1830s. Cattle were only owned by early missionaries and the European estate owners, which at that time, were very limited to ownership of Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, cattle farming then progressed from estates, from rearing under coconut plantations to bigger private farms. Later, it expanded to other geographical locations, especially Taveuni, Vanua Levu and Viti Levu. After a few decades, cattle farming expanded to other farming communities in the sugarcane, copra and rice plantations, where sufficient grazing land were available, especially in rural settlements. Records show that, we at one time exported processed beef and milk products to Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand. Fiji had also in the past, exported live cattle to other Pacific countries. By the 1930s, a notable American had a 100,000 acres ranch operating in Tova in the Ra Province which maintained 31,478 heads of cattle. This was considered the biggest cattle farm at that time. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, Fiji is still heavily reliant on imported dairy products and beef prime cuts to meet our local demand and the tourist market. In 2022, Fiji imported $29.9 million worth of beef and $16.3 million worth of milk which signifies greater local demand and opportunities to invest in the cattle industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also address the concern raised by honourable Sachida Nand in his response to the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways’ Ministerial Statement on Wednesday with regards to milk production in Fiji. I confirm that Fiji’s total milk production in 2022 was around 12 million litres. Of these, 6.07 million litres of milk was produced for the Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL), which accounts for the formal market and around 6 million litres of milk was produced by the informal sector, those that did not go through the processing facility in Nabua.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2333 Mr. Speaker, Sir, cattle production had been limited by a number factors, including: (1) Lack of available improved cattle breeds; (2) Animal health issues; (3) Poor plant and animal nutrition; (4) Changing climatic condition; (5) Reducing grazing land areas; (6) High input costs; and (7) Global requirement and policies, for example, a reduction in methane emission. Efforts to increase the productivity of the Fijian cattle industry such as importing and distributing breeding stock to farmers had been in place with the Ministry for a few decades. The success of these strategies is, however, low as evidenced by the persisting low off-take and market gap. Considering the status of cattle genetics in Fiji, the Ministry is committed to improving genetics through embryo transfer technology and artificial insemination. Therefore, Fiji envisions producing its own semen straws and embryos from Sigatoka Research Station, which will support the mass dissemination of improved genetics. This ensures the supply of quality breeding cattle for farms, for the improvement of genetics which will contribute to the improvement of quality and increase the volume of beef and dairy in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address the losses through diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, the Ministry is committed to its national testing and removal of infected cattle from farms. This is a government funded project that will be coordinated with other stakeholders. Poor plant and animal nutrition affects animal production by reducing productivity. The Government, through its farmers support programmes, will pay more emphasis in improving animal nutrition. The Ministry had identified a land for the production of planting material that will provide planting material for farmers. The unavailability of land had been identified as another major livestock restriction. The competition for land amongst other infrastructural development, alongside population pressure puts the limiting cap on expanding the livestock development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, high input cost and reducing land area of production had been addressed through the Government support on funded programmes to improve infrastructure, construction of farm roads, provision of drinking water and introduction of technologies that will help assist improve animal production. The Government is committed through its programmes, will address methane emission through appropriate technologies of methane digestion for home use and for soil improvement purposes. Research and development will continue in terms of alternative livestock feed sources that will yield with the reduced of methane emission rate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry prioritises the importance of animal welfare and, therefore, always promote good husbandry management practices. The best practices includes selection of best breeds with sound breeding plans, maintain healthy stock in good stockmanship, proper fencing and drinking practices, maintaining good grazing system with stock proof fences, sustainable and management practices and proper land care, maintenance and management of farm infrastructure, maintain proper hygiene practices and good waste management system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said the above, farmers are required to be in close contact with the</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2334 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 livestock officers. Capacity building will be conducted regularly, and farm visit will be done by livestock officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to support the livestock industry in Fiji as it plays a significant role with developing the other agriculture sector and it is contributing to the national economy. Importance of Protecting our Borders HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a statement on the importance of protecting our borders and the adherence to the rule of law. At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all Fijians for their confidence in the Coalition administration and their dedication to advancing and maintaining Fiji’s transformation into a more secure, tranquil country that maintain strict adherence to the law and its security measures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, protecting our boarders from the illicit movement of weapons, drugs, contraband and people while promoting lawful entry and exit and lawful trade is essential to Fiji’s security, economic prosperity and national sovereignty. The problem of protecting our country’s borders is without question one of the most highly debated issues we face today in the rise of trans- -national boarder crimes. The complexity of protecting our boarders while not infringing on individual rights or negatively impacting global trade should not be underestimated. Of equal importance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is our ability to move quickly, to reinforce the current security measures with enhanced measures properly supported by our regulations and our policies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the attacks on the twin towers in New York the emphasis of boarder security has been put on an access control and identification. Positive identification is more critical now than ever before. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Immigration Officers must stay up to date with changes in policy, legislation, internal procedures and ICT systems such as integrated boarder management system as well as the shifting migration trends in the region. Immigration plays a critical role in travel facilitation, border protection and revenue generation for the nation. Thus, training plays a crucial role in the immigration offices. As a result, the Department is working hard to strengthen the capacity building for developing policies and laws including areas that the capacity needs assessment highlighted and analysis in reporting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, securing our boarders is imperative and this must be done without disrupting the movement of people and goods. The fundamental change to the approach that the Fiji Immigration Department has taken is a model based on information, intelligence and integration which will address the issue of border security far more holistically than ever before. This has been achievable Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the help and coordination from our neighbours namely Australia through the Vuvale Partnership and New Zealand through the Hakil Matai Accord and also through the United Nations International Organisation of Migration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving and modernising Fiji’s boarders is a top priority and in light of the lesson learned from the Coronavirus pandemic and the emerging Variola virus there is an immediate need for a more efficient and well-coordinated border approach management. Since health risk has virtually replaced border risk, it will be considered for any border upgrades. We recognise the significance of striking a balance between boarder security and facilitation to promote our industry such as tourism. A strategy has already been put in place to improve the border to efficiently facilitate passenger flow and guarantee smooth travel for every individual visiting our shores. Mr. Speaker, at present Fiji Immigration Department is facing a surge in the number of applications of investor permits due to the frequent renewals by major holding corporations and the influx of new interested investors who have showed interest in investing in Fiji. This is because Fiji’s</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023 End of Week Statements 2335 current legal work framework Mr. Speaker, the Investment Fiji Act 2022 protects investors rights and interests as they do business within the country. Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, in light of this, some investment firms have abused these rights and privileges and have a tendency to find ways around the law that are already in place. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I wish make it clear that Fiji’s doors are open to all who wish to visit or intend to invest in Fiji but make no mistake, when they come to Fiji they must follow our laws and the Fiji Immigration Department and all law enforcement agencies will stay vigilant to protect our borders but most importantly, the adherence to the rule of law of our country and a good example of this Mr. Speaker, is the Grace Road Group in Fiji and to enlighten honourable Ketan Lal, this is the adherence of the rule of law. We will not be tolerating criminals in our country or harbouring them in our country. On that latter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to inform this august House about …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Police brutality:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU. R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.:</span> … Fiji’s stance for digitization solution based on trends and emerging security threats, identified from the increasing influx of people into the country as in transnational border activities are now centred in Fiji which has become the hub of the region. Therefore, enhancements to improve early detection work at the borders will focus on technology innovation and digitization to allow better co-ordination between our border agencies, including the Police and the Ministry of Health and with prompt assistance from our partners, Fiji Immigration Department will undoubtedly modernize Fiji’s border. Regarding our global responsibilities Fiji has succeeded to our international treaties and this is reflected in the Immigration Act 2003, in particular the enhancement of Part 6, determination of refugee status and the Immigration Regulation 2007 which together Mr. Speaker, established a clear legal framework to assess claims of asylum. The department works hard to complete its standard operating procedure in order to support and maintain a balance between available resources, security and facilitation. These circumstances Mr. Speaker, of the standing operating procedure determine how we handle mass migrations and displacements like those of refugees and asylum seekers. To be able to map our responses we must assess the quality of the data, create an insightful analysis and comprehend the changing migratory trends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a budget of $8.6 million in the 2023/2024 fiscal year, Fiji Immigration Department is mindful of the mammoth task that it bears and wishes to inform the House that our borders are very important and more so the adherence of the rule of law and needs the support of this august Parliament. In addition, Fiji Immigration Department is committed to working with businesses and investor to ensure we are striking the right balance between security and facilitation. To conclude Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the hardworking men and women of the Fiji Immigration Department who are here with us this afternoon and law enforcement agencies who also play a major role in the protection of our borders and wish them well as they continue to deliver in the midst of high demand for immigration and border services domestically and globally. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you may have been wondering why I did not offer the floor to the honourable Minister for Agriculture. He did highlight in his Statement yesterday that his Assistant Minister would be delivering in the End of Week Statement issues regarding their</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2336 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023 particular field in terms of cattle. The two honourable Members are well known and are popular in the Pacific as they have indicated. Cattle has been traded from Fiji everywhere, sheep, goats, they even bring bulls from Australia to here. So that is why I did not give the opportunity for the honourable Minister to reply or make a response to the Statement made by his Assistant Minister. Both are highly qualified in the field of agriculture. As for this one, let me put it this way. The End of the Week Statement is usually given to the Opposition but the past government changed all that and they were even making End of the Week Statements as well. So, this is another avenue available to the Opposition to be providing that. But to go that way again, I leave that to the government of the day to decide whether they allow to use that opportunity for the Opposition only or is it to be continued as done by the previous government. But for the reply or the response, it is up the honourable Minister for Home Affairs whether he wants to make a response to his Assistant Minister’s End of the Week Statement or not.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, you never refuse a good offer.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> (Inaudible) HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- First of all, I would like to thank the honourable Assistant Minister in my Office, Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure for the sentiments that he has echoed on the subject on which he has already spoken on the End of the Week Statement on the Rule of Law particularly protecting our borders. I also would like to acknowledge the presence of members of the Department that are here and I thank them for the work that they do. The Department of Immigration interchange of portfolios of this Government has now come under the Ministry of Home Affairs as you know, Sir. It is the Home Affairs and Immigration, something that was either independent or under the portfolio of another Minister in the past. We cannot emphasise any more the importance and the criticalness of the work that the Department does, and that is keeping our borders safe particularly controlling the people that we allow into Fiji and also controlling the people that get out of Fiji. Also, they provide an essential part of our development through the issuing of work permit and passports and all other services related to that but it has not been easy, Mr. Speaker. This year the Department of Immigration is moving into our new headquarters here in Suva. We also need to look at other facilities that are available particularly in the West in terms of those officers too. An issue that came up with the National Security Council Meeting is actually the functions of immigration at the border. I know that the honourable Naupoto when he was Director and Member of Parliament later on had argued many cases about this where Customs under FRCS performed the functions of an Immigration Officer. This has its benefits as well as risks. This is something that Government is reconsidering, Mr. Speaker. The whole intention is actually to strengthen the capability of the Department in order to keep our borders safe particularly when they man our gates when people come into Fiji and otherwise. I also take this opportunity for all the other departments that perform the functions of the Immigration Officers in the Navy and in the Police at times when it is required. From where you are sitting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will see that majority of the people who work in the Immigration Office are actually youth. So, we do take cognizance of the fact that the youth are important to our development but I</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>2337 would just like to say perhaps (I see the honourable Ketan Lal is laughing), this is not against you but I think the youth have actually lost faith in FijiFirst, honourable Ketan Lal, because you did not support the reduction of travel allowances earlier on. Mr. Speaker, I cannot re-emphasize further the safety of border, we talked about drugs earlier on and keeping Fiji safe and keeping Fijians safe is the function of our Office particularly the Office of the Immigration to make sure that only good people come here and to keep away those who are not supposed to come here and threaten our livelihood.</p></body>
