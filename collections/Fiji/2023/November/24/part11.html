<body><h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3><h4>SPEAKER’S RULING</h4><p>Point of Order – Hon. Prof. B. C. Prasad and Hon. S. Nand Honourable Members, at this juncture, I now wish to address the Point of Order that was raised on 21 st November, 2023. I can confirm that I have reviewed the relevant excerpts of the Uncorrected Daily Hansard of that sitting day. The honourable Sachida Nand was reporting to the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. The excerpts read as follows: “HON. S. NAND.- I would highly recommend our Minister of Finance to get off from his four wheel drive, get out of his overseas trips and go to the farm and talk to the farmers. It is no good sitting here and saying, ‘we give subsidy, we give fertiliser subsidy, seed subsidy’ - no, talk to the farmers. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. NAND.- Go and talk to the farmers and then you will understand the plight of the farmers.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not do BBQ from the road like you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> That statement is uncalled for and I must remind the honourable Minister of Finance, I do not do that.” Honourable Members, there were exchanges during the day and I now refer to the earlier exchange from the Uncorrected Daily Hansard of the same day which reads as follows: “HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just this morning the honourable Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister stated, “go and do roadside BBQ”. I do not do roadside BBQ.” The response from honourable Professor Biman Prasad, I quote: “HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD. – I did not say that. HON. S. NAND. – Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is a usual trend of the honourable Member to backtrack what he is saying. This is an insult to the hundreds of people who sell roadside BBQs to make ends meet. These are the people who do hard work to feed the people. These are not the people who go around texting other people’s wives, inviting them over; these are not the people. It is important that these people should be, we are talking about poverty alleviation. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD – Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is imputing improper motive. He knows what happened and he knows how that matter was disposed of. I think he is totally going down to gutter level and insulting, hurling insults using this</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>2304 Speaker’s Ruling 24 th Nov., 2023 parliamentary Chamber.” Honourable Members, having reviewed the Uncorrected Daily Hansard for that particular day, I confirm that there were exchanges from both honourable Members that were unbecoming and disorderly. I am satisfied that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister used offensive words against the honourable Sachida Nand in contravention of Standing Order 62(4)(a). I am also satisfied that the honourable Sachida Nand had indeed imputed improper motives to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister in contravention of Standing Order 62(1). In a previous Ruling, I had stated that friendly banter is always welcomed but stooping low and playing gutter level attack on each other does not augur well in maintaining the decorum, honour and dignity of our Parliament. On that note, I hereby rule that the two honourable Members must withdraw their disorderly statements. I will ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to withdraw his statement on, “I do not do BBQ from the road like you.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I withdraw that statement.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I will ask honourable Sachida Nand to withdraw his statement on, “These are not the people who go around texting other people’s wives, inviting them over.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I withdraw that statement.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Thank you, honourable Members. Point of Order – Hon. Leader of the Opposition Honourable Members, we will now move on and, that is, on the second Point of Order that was raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition on 22 nd November, 2023. Honourable Members, a Point of Order was raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition whereby he called the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, Professor Biman Prasad, to bring proof to Parliament about the allegations that he had made. Again, I have duly perused the Uncorrected Daily Hansard of Wednesday, 22nd November, 2023, specifically on pages 2171 and 2172, the honourable Professor Biman Prasad said and I quote: “The use of Section 127(8) of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked about that. It is in the Constitution, there is nothing we can do about it, but this Government moved the Ministry of Public Service under the Prime Minister, under whom the Public Service Commission is also based. The Public Service Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is only responsible for appointing the Permanent Secretaries, but under the Constitution, the Permanent Secretaries have absolute power but with the agreement of the Ministers. What was happening in the past, the Ministers were making appointments and it happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir in many cases.” Honourable Members, the honourable Leader of the Opposition then raised a Point of Order pursuant to Standing Order 74 asking that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister bring</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents</h4><p>2305 proof about appointments being made that were made by Ministers and not according to the processes. Honourable Members, I am satisfied that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was referring to the provisions of the Constitution and therefore I hereby rule that there was no misrepresentation of information nor breach of the Standing Orders. On that Point of Order by the honourable Leader of the Opposition yesterday on the issue of “loot”, I will deliver my ruling at a later date.</p></body>
