<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Forum Fisheries Committee Members – Distribution of Funds (Question No. 195/2023) HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament if the distribution of the US$60 million among Forum Fisheries Committee members has been agreed upon? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. For better understanding of the question, please, allow me to provide some background information on the Foreign Fisheries Committee setup at the US Treaty Agreement for which the $60 million funding is attached to.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Just answer the question:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- $60 million? I think he is getting there. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Carry on! HON. K. V. RAVU.- Fiji along with the 16 Pacific Island nations is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA). MR. SPEAKER.- He is in charge of fisheries. They bait the thing, and then they throw it right out and then they pull it in slowly. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Yes, Sir. I want you to understand where it comes from and the utilisation of this $60 million. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I am still talking. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Alright, you may continue. HON. K. V. RAVU.- The Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC) Ministerial is the decision- making body for the membership, and that being the governing body of the FFA. The FFC Official meeting... HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order! MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Standing Order 60 on relevance. The question is ….</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2307 (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- When there is a Point of Order, honourable Minister, you take your seat and we will listen to the Order being raised. HON. J. USAMATE.- Standing Order 60 on relevance, the question is very simple. All we want to know, what is the distribution of the US$60 million. We do not want to hear the big story about these agencies, we know what it is. Just answer the question. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thought I added my statement on how the honourable Minister looks at answering his questions, because by profession he is a fisherman. They just do not go and bait the hook and throw it in the water and pull the fish out. They will have to drag it for quite some distance. But I hope, you will not be dragging it too long; that is the concern. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC) Ministerial is the decision-making body for the membership, and that being the governing body of the FFA. The FFC official meeting is where the senior officials discuss the technical matters which are then referred to the FFC Ministers for a decision. What is the purpose of the US Treaty Agreement? Whilst this Treaty acknowledges the sovereignty of the coastal states under international law for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing fisheries resources in their EEZs. This Treaty pursues the maximisation of benefits to coastal states, via the provision of fishing access to the United States purse seiner vessels to waters under the Pacific Island nations jurisdiction and areas beyond their national jurisdictions, and therein provides a platform of corporation between the parties. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this point, I would like to make mention that Fiji was Chair to the FFC during 2021-2022. I, therefore, pay tribute to my predecessor, honourable Koroilavesau who was the FFC Chairman for the period for his stern and visionary leadership in the FFC Ministers negotiation process along with other Fisheries Ministers in the Pacific. Their collective effort saw the tripling of the USD funds from US$21 million to US$60 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the 20 th FFC Ministerial Meeting in the Republic of the Marshall Islands early this year, the issue of distribution of the US$60 million funding was not resolved. Two special FFC meetings were called by FFA, here in Fiji and Papua New Guinea in August and September 2023 respectively. In the spirit of regional solidarity, the Pacific Fisheries Ministers finally resolved the USD funding distribution in October after the PNG meeting. The distribution have given recognition to all issues that were debated on - fishing access agreement versus geopolitical positioning, financial risks and burdens carried out by the Pacific nations under the Vessel Day Scheme/PNA Pool, even to the extent of Australia and Papua New Guinea giving their full shares to the five Pacific nations under the Exploratory Pool (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Niue and Vanuatu) to close up the great disparity in the distribution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three categories for the distribution formula: (1) Payment for upfront days - this is determined by the members who have US vessels fishing in their waters; (2) Project Development Fund - this is given to each member to supplement their national budget provisions to fund fisheries related projects; and</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>2308</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 (3) Equal Share - this is the portion of funds that is equally shared to all members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the formula above, the funds distributed this year is US$31 million (that is the US$21 million plus US$10 million) funds for climate change, $60 million will be distributed from 2024 to 2033. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the distribution formula is very technical in nature, it took the Fisheries Ministers four negotiation meetings to come to a solution. So, in the interest of time and with your concurrence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the detail can be provided at a later date, if still required. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Minister and before I offer the floor to the honourable Rinesh Sharma, honourable Members it pays to be patient, especially with the Fisheries Minister. Otherwise, we would not have heard that very positive compliment made to the former Minister, honourable Semi Koroilavesau for the great work he had undertaken. So, thank you very much honourable Minister. In future, can we ask that you just shorten your answers, please?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I do agree with you, less of a reply and more of a Ministerial Statement. Question to the honourable Minister for Fisheries in terms of ownership of marine commodity. Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries inform Parliament and the people of this country, can a Minister be the owner of a company that deals with the buying and selling of beche-de-mer and is this legal? MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, I will allow that supplementary question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, it is a new question and I cannot answer it now.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> You heard me saying, I will allow that question to be raised with you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> So you do not have any answer to that? Will you be coming back to Parliament with a reply?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, what honourable Minister? Vakamacalataka nomui sau ni taro, o na lesu tale mai ke? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question, I will come back at a later date. MR. SPEAKER.- No, it is not a new question, I have allowed it to proceed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> I will come back, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka:</span> (Question No. 196/2023 withdrawn) MR. SPEAKER.- I want to make a comment, this is the second time you have done this honourable Assistant Minister, on just the approach you have taken as the Assistant Minister and</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2309 then the kind of questions you are raising here, to ensure that we are consistent in the role we play and who is the leader of your side of the Government and what he plays and where do we take our queue from. I hope it could be a learning item for you. Trafficking and Usage of Hard Drugs in Fiji (Question No. 197/2023) HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: Given the major increase in the trafficking and use of hard drugs in Fiji in recent months, can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament what steps the Government is taking to address this issue? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Fiji is encountering a serious drug problem. This has not only evolved over the last month perhaps as the question seems to suggest, it has come like for a very long time now. I just want to share some statistics with Parliament, Mr. Speaker, to highlight for us the significance of this issue and the problem that it is causing our society. This is not something that we must deny because this is in the midst of our community and the responsibility here is national, Mr. Speaker. The Coalition Government will do their bit under what is allowed but we must take cognizance of this as a nation and work together in all facets of society and I think that has been the sentiments echoed throughout in terms of addressing this issue. So, over the past 12 months, Mr. Speaker, police have recorded a total of 1,564 drug-related cases, averaging 130 cases per month. Within this total, 128 cases involving methamphetamine, 1 case involving cocaine, 141 were related to marijuana cultivation and the majority of 1,294 cases involving the unlawful possession of marijuana. This is very unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, because it is a reflection of our society and what we do, and as I have said, this is something that has been ongoing and this is a familiar issue from this Parliament. We have been talking about this forever which requires a dedicated effort and a national solution but as on the part of government, Mr. Speaker, we have ratified the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, in 1971 the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and this demonstrates our national commitment to dealing with the drug issues under national arrangement or international arrangement. As far as the government is concerned and for our perspective because this is not only police work, we only do a very small part of it in terms of prevention and also prosecution and investigation, that is part of our work. So we deal with the community in every facet, we talk to faith-based organisations, to the vanua, to communities, to schools which are presently under threat and through the Fiji Police - Narcotics Bureau talking to our community about the effects of drugs and what it does to us, and the police through its operations are just trying very hard to control this. We all understand in the past about police going out, up-rooting marijuana plants, raiding places where drug has been trafficked. But we are also partnering with major nations of the world to try and look after this, so we have signed an agreement with the United States Narcotics Bureau in terms of the provision of funds, perhaps similar to what the US is giving to the region. We signed this agreement about two months ago here. Fiji will benefit from this in terms of intelligence gathering, collation of intelligence, receiving of funds particularly for prevention and also in other areas where Fiji could benefit. So, this is not something that we are doing alone. We are working with stakeholders and our</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2310</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 partners because this is something that affects everyone, not only Fiji but Fiji, in our position, is the centre in which people try to push drugs. This is something that we have been trying to do for a very long time, not only this Government over the last nine months, but previously everyone has been trying. But what I am trying to say here, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to maybe suggest this again, I had raised this in 2019 in this House, this problem needs a national solution that starts with this House. I will raise it again because this is what we have been raising with Government as the Opposition for a very, very long time. Now we have the political will to do it, we want to do it and we would like to bring the House together for something that should benefit our community. I am not denying this at all because it is a reality on the ground that needs to be done, but we need to do it together because not Government alone or the Police can do it, we all have to do it as a nation. We need to look after our children. This has been ongoing for a long, long time, Mr. Speaker. To deny it means the diminishing of our values. This is something that this House must take into cognisance together and work together and get a solution so that is perhaps the challenge that I am putting to the House today whilst we ask ourselves, we should be part of the solution too. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wanted to ask the honourable Minister, are we at a national crisis point or bordering or nearing a national crisis point on this issue? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Again, Mr. Speaker, as far as I am concerned we reached a national crisis in 2019. I raised it here on the day and my good friend the honourable Leader of the Opposition understood this. I raised it in this House. I sought a bilateral solution. Drugs, I said is overwhelming in this country, it is well before. Only the tip of the iceberg is becoming bigger and bigger. In this very House, I understood when we did this debate and my good friend understood this. He gave a solution in terms of using manoeuvre warfare theory and I said in Parliament, the problem is no longer in the deep battle, it is not even in the close, it is in our rear, I used it here, but this House did not have the motivation, the courage to deal with this. So, in answer to the honourable Member’s question, it culminated a long time ago. We are only feeling the effects now. I am not denying it has happened during my term but what I am saying, this is the overload of what we are getting. So, I am no trying to point a finger at anyone, I am just trying to share the reality with everyone and I am warning that problem and I am asking the House, let us rise up to this. I am going to propose to Cabinet that it moves into Parliament in the next sitting a bilateral Committee of this House that deals with this and cause the resource in the Budget to deal with it because otherwise, our children, we do not know what is going to become of them. That is the point I am trying to say, Mr. Speaker, but this has been long coming, it is not culminated now. It is a crisis on our hands, and we need a solution beginning with this House. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Naupoto, may I just add a few lines here regarding the problem that has been described. We have these kinds of drugs in my province. It is not the marijuana that we are talking about, no these are the hard drugs. We even have it in my village in Somosomo and honourable Members, the honourable Minister had raised this way back in 2019. What have we done to try and ensure that we take care to eradicate this? It would be difficult to eradicate it, maybe to try and alleviate it. That is why I was describing it last night on the way forward for parliamentarians if it is possible because we had just discussed it this morning with the Executive of the Legislature as to how best we can continue and not wait for the trip to Australia to have a look see at what they are doing to enhance the role of Members of Parliament.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2311 Instead of just looking at the annual reports that was attacked very strongly by their honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs yesterday, what can we do? Parliament is already looking at this. Standing Order 110 allows sub-committees of the Standing Committees to be formed, but it is the terms of reference that is given and all that, that will need to come from the support of the Government and through the Business Committee, we will try and raise that and hopefully we can sit in between now and the recess period so as to enable us to prepare ourselves on this particular role that we need to play. This would be an additional role of MPs. These are the roles that they are undertaking in Australia and New Zealand. They have an oversight role into the policies. To look into the government policies is not easy because you are kind of unruffling feathers here, you are interfering with government work but hopefully if it is all taken in a good sense, yes, we will be answering the honourable Minister for Home Affairs’ problem on what are we doing. I am concerned with that comment because so far I have also been raising this, but this morning, we have decided to go ahead, get the Standing Orders Committee and see how best we can address this whilst garnishing the support of the government of the day. Honourable Naupoto, you have a supplementary question? HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is more operational or technical. It has to do with Vanua Levu, especially Taveuni, Sir, with regards to drug trafficking. The Committee visited Vanua Levu and Taveuni and we were briefed that the drug problem is really increasing. As we were sitting at Matei Airport (you see people going out of Matei and people coming in) there is a dog kennel, but you have two tracker dogs. Taveuni offers that very weak link in terms of trafficking when it comes to the airport because when you come in, if you are moving from Taveuni to Suva, your luggage is not screened. There is no sniffer dog, you just come in, they take it and put it into the carousel and then it goes into the aircraft, and from Nausori that bag is from the aircraft straight to the baggage carousel outside. So if someone is wanting to traffic, you can fly in from Suva, pick up a bag in Taveuni, there are a lot of yachts that come to Taveuni, pick it over there, it would not be checked at the airport, you will arrive in Nausori and it would not be checked again because it goes straight to the carousel. In Taveuni, you have those two tracker dogs, maybe an idea if you would consider having a sniffer dog instead of two tracker dogs that can work at the airport. In Labasa, Sir, we were told by the Police that there used to be a Canine Unit there, no longer now and perhaps for Labasa Airport the same. Maybe a comment as to whether you would consider a sniffer dog instead of the tracker dog. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Canine capability is actually quite good, a very effective way not only to track down but also to sniff out drugs. Given this suggestion, I am going to raise this with the Commissioner of Police in terms of how they redeploy these assets. We have very limited dogs, we have got some new dogs, both sniffers and also trackers - if they could take this matter into account and then maybe send one extra sniffer dog to Taveuni or Labasa also for that matter, I will look at that too. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Supplementary question, Sir. Thank you, honourable Minister for your response and the explanation, I totally agree with you. It is big work there and a challenge for everyone in this House. Sir, the only concern I have is the use of our children for drug trafficking right now. Going back to a report that came in some months ago, it is happening in schools, it is happening everywhere. While waiting for all these committees and whatever the next process that we are going to take to try</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2312</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 and curb this problem, do we have measures in place right now to look after our children from being used as drug traffickers? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. This is something that the Ministry of Education is working very hard at with the Police in particular, and also Social Welfare to deal with that. But I think at the end of the day, this really goes back to parenting and I cannot deny that anymore. I allude to the same things that I had raised earlier, the whole of our society needs to help parents look after their children. These children do come from home, at some point they pick up these things and then they take them to school. The Ministry of Education will do their bit and also through Social Welfare, we are also looking at strengthening the laws to be able to look at that. Our schools are pretty much free for our children - a free environment for education. We do not want to do in our schools what they do in America or in other nations to try and control drugs especially in public schools but I think it calls at the end of the day all of our responsibility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, I would just like to share with Parliament some of my observations. I am sure for all of us that were, particularly the iTaukei and I am sure also our Indo- Fijian brothers and sisters also experience this, when we were raised in a village environment, not only were our parents responsible for our upbringing but everyone else was concerned about our upbringing - tamada levu, nana levu, uncle or our grandparents also vata kei na lotu; they played a big part in trying to build our character. It is very unfortunate that has now gone. Actually, it is really, really sad. This is dwelling into other areas so when we have people who assist the parent to make the child become a better child, there is going to be less of this happening. I mean I am just throwing that in again here because that is a very good point you raised there, honourable Member, but then it goes back to the same old thing which I can only think of one solution, and it needs to start from here. If we set the policies, Parliament work with government, get out the resources, get out there and reach out to the community, come up with the right solutions as I have said, this has culminated a long time. We have to do something now. MR. SPEAKER.- I will allow two more supplementary questions. The first one is from honourable Matasawalevu before the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and then honourable Niudamu. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his statement on drugs. It is not only the marijuana that is here in Fiji, we have different types of drugs now in Fiji. My question is, does the Force know about cybercrime or cybersecurity because most of the drugs coming to our shores now is from the use of apps when dealing with drugs with people from overseas. They are using WhatsApp now but Viber before. They are now using different types of apps, like video games when talking and dealing with drugs. Has the Force learnt more about cybercrime or cybersecurity to track down drugs coming to our shores? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Absolutely. We are building capacity and cybercrime is probably one of our biggest threats. I was with the NYPD a couple of months ago and we talked about the complexities of how they get drugs from South America through Fiji because the electromagnetic spectrum is so big and wide. They use the internet and every other means of communication through satellite, well beyond our capacity to be able to even monitor.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2313 We only have so many patrol boats, we share intelligence with DEA, Interpol and other agencies of security throughout the world, even through ustate.com, et cetera. We try to track drugs down and we are dealing with people who have a lot of money. The Police, unfortunately, right now, Mr. Speaker, needs the capacity to be able to fight that. Anything on the electromagnetic spectrum is very hard to detect with the kind of resources that we have. We need partners to do this. We have partners that are helping us right now to do that as well, but it is a major challenge, I understand. We are working with our partners trying to keep our border safe. I mean, we are an archipelagic state. Honourable Naupoto has just referred to a case from Taveuni. It comes from the Lau Group, then it comes all that way undetected to here, then it goes to New Zealand. Sometimes we catch it, sometimes we do not, but many of the times we do not, but these are capacity building - we will build over time. Mr. Speaker, the Government is talking to the Ministry of Home Affairs of Australia and of the United States of America, people who have the capacity to give us information and to build our cybersecurity to endure the current threats that are passing through it, that comes to affect our society. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, a very important issue and no one denies the seriousness of the drug problem in Fiji. But I am a bit reluctant on the national crisis term that we are using because of the implications as well to us, not that I am denying this, but how we define the national crisis and how it is going to affect us in terms of, particularly, people coming into the country, tourism, et cetera. But the critical point that I want to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because of the question raised by honourable Tuinaceva on children being used and how we are dealing with it. If I may alert the honourable Attorney-General and the honourable Minister as well, one of the biggest delays in this whole work is the Juveniles Act because they are being used as mules to take the drugs but the Juveniles Act is where there is a lot of complications. I would kindly ask the honourable Attorney-General if we could seriously look into this. The question to the honourable Minister is, while we are doing a lot of work, he mentioned about the lack of capability that we have, how are we again pursing our efforts with our partners to make use of, particularly, the technology that they have because of the porous border, particularly the maritime border that we have and how are we utilising them throughout the machinery that we have just to help us? How is it being pursued further because that will be of great assistance to us? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, from a ministerial perspective, I can share this with the honourable Leader of the Opposition. He will understand during his time that we had built the capacity in the Ministry to be able to coordinate with, particularly, our intelligence, not only through defence, but also in law enforcement. They have these people who are stationed in our Embassies and High Commissions who help to do that - coordinate this assistance. At our own level, we talked to New Zealand, Australia and USA - the government departments that help us to coordinate, particularly, information sharing. This is one capacity that we are dealing with under this internal security review, to rebuild that centre. I know you used it particularly a lot during your term, but it has been officially incapacitated in many ways, and I want to rebuild that. You will understand what I am talking about here. This is the centre where we share information with everyone else, and we are rebuilding that, we are inviting the French Government. I can say, we have got the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), DEA and international partners</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>2314</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 that have capability. We have been talking to the Australians, the Minister for Home Affairs at the Ministerial level and at every level, because we understand the magnitude because they also understand that what is coming from here is going to them. I would like to assure the honourable Minister and thank you for raising the issue of juveniles. There was this person who came to see me the other day and he told me, “You need to get the Juveniles Act reviewed”, so I am actually on it because this is one neglected part of the work that Police really has to look at also - dealing with young people. However, if we can get our partners, we get them back into the room that we are familiar with, honourable Leader of the Opposition, I am sure there is a lot of coordination tying up we can do to seal the gaps that we have, particularly in dealing with drugs. Not only drugs, but arms and all other contrabands that come through our country. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister in relation to hard drugs, particularly, methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine, including cocaine, to name a few, in addition to marijuana. How safe are these drugs when kept at our Police Exhibit Rooms because we have seen in the past that it has gone missing from the Police Exhibit Rooms? What is the Police doing about this issue, particularly, in the safe keeping of these drugs before it reaches the trial? I understand that there are provisions in the Illicit Drugs Act where we can dispose of those drugs before the trials, but what about those accused persons who dispute the drugs and they are kept at the Police Exhibit Rooms, how safe are those?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.</p><p>I know I had alluded to this earlier because this is talking about the handling of exhibits. Yes, you are right. Over the years, I think that has been the joke going around. If you leave the exhibits around for too long unsecured, it is not going to be there. I am sure the former Commissioner of Police will attest to that. It happened, it is not new. But the responsibility is here, and I have talked about these new police stations with better and more secure drug facilities. That is where we are going, Mr. Speaker. Much of the drugs, particularly hard drugs, we have counter safes. Within these big, controlled rooms, we have big safes also for things like methamphetamine and components of which that they use to make these drugs. If you go to Nadi, I can take the honourable Member for a tour, I can show you how we have brought all these exhibits where it is kept and then we can bring them to court when they are needed. Obviously, Police are now talking to DPP, Judiciary, Office of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General on how we can review our laws, on how we can destroy the drugs on site and still being able to use the evidence as if the drugs were still there and were produced in court on the day. So, this is something we are working on too. This is something that the Police are struggling with, particularly, if they go up to Saqani in Vanua Levu, particularly in Natewa, I understand. It is very hard to carry them, this bulk of drugs from the bush. So, somehow, they are trying to find the legal framework to destroy the evidence but to be able to continue to keep whatever it is. I do not know what the legal term is. We cannot say, “admissible in court”, so we are looking after that too. Empowerment of Co-operatives and Business Sustainability (Question No. 198/2023) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2315 Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on how the Ministry is empowering co-operatives and promoting business sustainability? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vocea for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, may I be allowed to respond very politely to two issues that were raised yesterday in Parliament. The first one was to do with the regulation of mobile companies, and I did state that the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) actually regulates them. So, I asked for a confirmation from the RBF and there are only two mobile wallets in Fiji operating currently, which is M-PAiSA and MyCash. They are regulated under the National Payment System Act 2021 and the National Payment System Regulations 2022. They were passed by the FijiFirst Government in 2021 and the Regulations came into effect in 2022. That is why Telecom is not under regulation because it does not have a mobile wallet. The second issue that I just thought I would clarify, there is much talk about Fiji Water, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I just thought to clarify once and for all in terms of Parliament. We understand how this arrangement with Fiji Water came about. Let me state categorically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and I who were heavily involved, there is zero loss of revenue to the Government of Fiji in terms of the arrangements. So, whilst there is a tax-free arrangement, what has happened is, if you look at the actual Act, for suppliers that supply over 10 million litres per month, you have to pay a higher price at $19.05 and that covers for the income tax. In fact, it covers for more than just, it is about $2 million extra. I just thought, Sir, that I would clarify that to the Members of the Parliament. We, on this side of Parliament are very careful with Government revenue. It is an arrangement that has done some better things for Fiji Water in terms of its overall global business but in terms of Fiji, there is absolutely no loss of revenue in Fiji. I just thought I would clarify that. What it does do though, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, it creates a better working relationship with Fiji Water and, hopefully, we can collaborate in other areas of the economy going forward. In terms of the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is quite an important one and I guess from this side of Parliament, the reason we placed a lot of importance on co-operatives, it is now part of the Ministry officially which I look after. Currently, there is about 554 Co-operatives in Fiji, operating across 15 various sectors. I have to say here, Sir, I was just looking at some of the infographics, it covers the whole of Fiji. That augurs well for what the Government will try and do, which is to try and push economic activity into the rural areas where most of these co-operatives are based. In terms of how we are going about trying to empower businesses, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are various forms of assistance that we have developed over the years. This include what we call as handholding services. Our Ministry, in terms of setting up a co-operative, it takes time and then there is a need for a lot of awareness and a lot of handholding with those who are interested with co- operatives. So, that is a major service and we have officers that cover Suva, Lami, Sigatoka and basically the whole of Fiji and their prime job is to try and drive for co-operatives to be formed and developed. Basically, over the last 12 months, we have added about 76 new co-operatives, Sir, into the books. I suspect that numbers will increase more rapidly. The honourable Minister for Youth and</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2316</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 Sports who is not here is actually trying to encourage the youth clubs to form co-operatives, like a commercial arm, so I suspect that the number will increase which augurs well, again, for the way we are trying to drive the economy. A lot of training the Ministry undertakes and this is financial training and governance training, bookkeeping as well to try and assist the co-operatives in starting up and moving forward. We are trying to do the best we can in terms of both access to finance, that has always been a challenge with co-operatives or small businesses in general. I think one of the big solutions is something that the honourable Premila Kumar alluded to, which is the National ID card. That is something that we will try and introduce next year as a project because if that comes through, it hastens all the identification process, et cetera. Also, access to markets. We are also, where we can, try and connect businesses to markets. Those are some of the things that we are currently involved in, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have pages and pages of notes here, but I just thought that I would highlight that. We are very committed to developing very sustainable co-operatives. We have had a rich history of co-operatives in this country, going a long way back, and I think in terms of how we intend to develop the rural economy, the co-operatives would certainly be a significant vehicle that would be used to try and generate economic activity, particularly, in the rural setting. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question. Before that, I also would like to declare my interest under section 59 of the Standing Orders. I am a farmer and president of the Riverside Farmers’ Co-operative in Ba - one of the biggest sugarcane farmers co-operative. We were also assisted with the $90,000 grant by the FijiFirst Government to purchase harvesters, similar to all other co-operatives. That is really assisting the farmers on flat land. There is a provision whereby if we remove the two back tyres and if it is replaced by rubber tracks, then we can harvest on a slope of 30 degrees to 40 degrees. My question is, is there are any sort of assistance, because the rubber tracks comes at a cost of about $40,000 to $50,000. Is there any assistance from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister or in coordination with the Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Sugar? If that assistance is given, it will further assist in regard to the shortages of labour and the harvesters can harvest on a slope of 30 degrees to 45 degrees. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my suggestion would be to either channel that question directly through our Ministry and we can certainly pick that up. Generally some of the agricultural assistance is either done through us or done through the Ministry of Agriculture. We normally then have a conversation as to who picks it up. Sir, I am quite happy to look at that and any other agricultural interest that are out there. Progress – Savusavu, Levuka and Nakasi Markets (Question No. 199/2023) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the progress of the Savusavu, Levuka and Nakasi Markets that were initiated by the previous government? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question posed</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2317 before this august Parliament this morning. First, let me thank and commend the initiatives by the previous government for the commencement of these three markets namely Savusavu, Levuka and Nakasi Markets. However, it took the previous government eight years to finally construct the three markets apart from other markets that we have. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government continues to prioritise the development and refurbishment of municipal markets. It is worth nothing, the present Government has allocated funding in this fiscal year (2023-2024) to excel business growth in the marketplaces. With this funding, my Ministry and the respective Councils aim to complete the three most anticipated markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Coalition Government believes that for any infrastructure development in the municipalities, we will require feasibility studies and business cases to comprehend the need for any capital projects to be undertaken. This will ensure the upgrading or construction of municipal markets which will benefit the Councils and the market vendors in the long run and such feasibility studies are imperative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the projects will strengthen the revenue streams of the Councils which will ensure their financial sustainability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $6.3 million, to be exact $6,305, 664 in total has been allocated for the completion of the three markets. The Savusavu Market would be the first ever market to replicate the Bluetown Mall in Fiji. This will not only benefit the farmers, but it will also benefit market vendors, tourists and the public at large. The new Savusavu Market is co-funded by the Government and United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women which is UN Women. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Savusavu Market has been allocated a sum of $3.8 million in this financial year which is for the completion of the market. The market will consist of 141 vendor stalls, some handicrafts kiosks, five SME kiosks which are located on the ground. The top floor will have provisions for one conference and meeting room, one kitchen, washroom facility, if there are MSME vendors, stalls, three food outlets, open spaces for future demands with exotic balcony fronting sea- view. The total project cost is $3.63 million, out of which, $2.5 million has been paid to date or 35 percent of the initial project cost. As alluded earlier, the project is co-funded by the Government and UN Women at a cost of $6.3 million and $340,000 respectively. The Council engaged lead consultant China Engineering and market contractor Jenn’s Construction for the Savusavu Market Project. On the progress of construction to-date, the structure is about 30 percent completed and the building is around 35 percent completed. Mr, Speaker, Sir, it is also very interesting to note that the project was expected to complete within 52 weeks, since October 2022. However, due to the delay in the release of funds by the previous government and unfavourable weather conditions, the further has delayed by 167 days. As such, the project is expected to be completed by March 2024, subject to better weather conditions. On the Nakasi Market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this market has been long overdue. For hose market vendors who sell illegally on the roadside, especially in Makoi, behind Hansons Supermarket, and Nakasi to Nausori areas. The new market has been allocated a sum of $979,930 in this new financial year. And designed to be a modern structure with proper washing facilities. It will also accommodate 70 carpark spaces, 130 general vendor stalls, 40 fish vendor stalls, a general office space, and public</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2318</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 convenience facilities with some provisions for the disabled. The total project cost is $1.9 million, out of which $759,000 or 39 percent of the national funding has been paid to-date. This project is under the administration of my Ministry, and Jenn’s Construction has been engaged as the main contractor for the Nakasi Market. The market construction was expected to be completed within 40 weeks since October 2022, however, due to the delay in the release of funds and unfavourable weather conditions, it is expected to be completed by March 2024. To-date the market has progressed with 50 percent of the work being completed. In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these two markets, Savusavu and Nakasi also incorporates some of the greener energy concepts, where solar energy panels have been installed, and also Bluetown concept where the solar panel will also be installed to promote Green Economy as well as rainwater harvesting. On Levuka Market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be a two-storey building that will accommodate spaces for more than 300 stalls for the market vendors, and approximately 310 market vendors are currently selling from the roadside under temporary tents, provided by UN Women under its Market for Change Project. The new Levuka Market will not only support the Municipal Council of Levuka, but it will accommodate those market vendors who endure the adverse weather conditions in their current, temporary market shelters. The market is funded by Government and UN Women, the total project cost is around $2.7 million out of which $400,000 is supported by UN Women. The project commenced in April 2022. Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to some adverse, also delays of funds, as well as adverse weather conditions, the project is expected to be, it is near completion, but we are proposing for commissioning and opening around January 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I took over the office, in the first six months, the Coalition Government that is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. There were new initiatives to assist some of our stations that really need assistance to have better and proper market facilities. The Dreketi Rural Centre which is a place where we have, in my first to Vanua Levu, I have noted the need to upgrade the existing market structure at Dreketi. For the information of Parliament, my Ministry in collaboration with Labasa Town Council decided to construct a temporary market to provide a secure and safe market with proper public convenience, because Dreketi is like a stopover for commuters who travel from Nabouwalu to Labasa to Savusavu. They normally stopover at Dreketi for a bite moved to Savusavu and even to Labasa. This year, the Government has allocated a sum of $100,000 for temporary works in the market at the new site. The temporary market structure is worth $72,000, out of which the Government funded $52,000 and the Labasa Town Council funded $20,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is interesting to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that when we commissioned, it only took us four months to complete the project and it was commissioned on 20 th September, 2023. We were amazed with the smiling faces that we put on the people of Dreketi, especially, the market vendors who used to sell at Dreketi Market. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst being a progressive government focused on economic development, provided spaces for vendors to sell. In the last eight years, FijiFirst government made Laqere Market, extended Ba Market, made Namaka Market, Rakiraki Market and</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2319 provided accommodation for women. I would like to ask the honourable Minister, what is he doing about the Navua Market where the money was withdrawn and diverted somewhere else? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Navua Market was not well planned. There was no good feasibility study for Navua Town. That is what we are trying to do at the moment. We are looking for the best place to relocate the Navua Market; that is something that we are doing right now. That is part of our vision, part of our mission is to also make Navua to become a town. So, there are few services, few facilities and infrastructure that we want to ensure we are doing it right before we declare Navua a town. Education (Establishment and Registration of Schools) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (Question No. 200/2023) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the Education (Establishment and Registration of Schools) (Amendment) Regulations 2023? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Just a quick update, the subject regulation was approved by Cabinet on 8 th September, 2023, which was to reverse the provision under the 1996 Regulation, which stipulates that the requirement for children who turn six years old by 30 th June of the same year of admission will now be enrolled as Year 1 students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the Cabinet Decision, this was gazetted on 28th September, 2023 and has now become law unlike the previous regulation that was yet to be gazetted and the decision to revert was based on the projected increase in enrolment in 2024 which was the basis of the earlier Cabinet Paper. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were limitations in terms of the feasibility study, in terms of readiness of the infrastructure and in terms of the readiness of additional teachers that will require this initial regulation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I would like to address the question that was also raised yesterday in terms of the enrolment. We see a lot more concerns being raised by parents and stakeholders regarding schools being levying some sort of a fee for an enrolment form. I would like to state here for the information of the honourable Members of Parliament and also the general public, the parents and guardians that the Ministry of Education does not condone such exercise and does not have a policy that requires parents that wishes to enrol their children into schools to pay a fee to access those enrolment forms. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for his response. Just a clarification on that matter, it is not really a question but the point that I want to raise is that we need to move forward. The problem is, it is really unfair for those children who turn six years old in June are denied enrolment for the whole year. So, if they are born in July, August, September of that admission year, they are sitting at home. Technologies have come in, these little children have been in Early Childhood Education (ECE) for two years but they are denied enrolment and the provision within that discussion, the provision was there that any parent who wants to enrol their children, they need to do a provisional enrolment and we want to focus more on provisional enrolments and I can see the problems that can be created when you do not know the number and how you are going to accommodate. We allowed for provisional enrolment whereby we can analyse the needs at different schools,</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2320</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th Nov., 2023 and we would have provided the infrastructure. The teachers starting from Year 1 and it just moves on. Because we also did our analysis and we found the…. MR. SPEAKER.- What is your supplementary question? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Yes, my question is actually a comment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Good comment:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I know:</span> What Deputy Prime Minister? (Hon. Prof. B. C. Prasad interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- No, she has made that comment. Honourable Members, in the past have also had the opportunity, when it arises you go for it and then when they are stopped to ask the question then they say, “no, this is just a comment.” Free Education Grant and Boarding Grant (Question No. 201/2023) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Prices of most items have increased due to increase in VAT and corporate tax. Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament whether the Ministry is considering increasing the Free Education Grant and Boarding Grant to meet the increase in the cost of items? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, saving the best for the last in terms of Question No. 5 by the honourable Member. Before I answer the question, I would just like to take this time to maybe remind the honourable Member that I think he knows very well the amount of assistance this government has given to 227,000 students who access the $200 back-to-school assistance at the beginning of this year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- That is different. I am asking on this:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.:</span> That culminates to your question regarding increase in VAT and also we are about to give another $200 again for back-to-school in 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for those in the tertiary level we have written off TELS loans that they have for them not to pay back so that is about 53,000 families that again will benefit from those initiatives and also …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.:</span> … we have also reviewed the payment of “location allowance” to teachers that were not eligible during your time. We are now trying to make them be eligible to pay for those that are truly in need of the location allowance.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question:</span></p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>24 th Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2321 HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Most of the teachers are now back teaching when we revised the retirement age from 55 to 60. So, most of the teachers are now back in school Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) Maybe, that is something that you should have also taken into consideration, honourable Member, before you ask the question but, anyway, in terms of the question, the Ministry will, first of all, review the school policies and procedures regarding financial management of the school as it is now due for review. In that management handbook, as you know, there are six allocations that the grant will need to be allocated to and used accordingly by the respective schools. These are government-funded schools, not private schools which is something that this government will also need to look at to accommodate those students that are eligible for this assistance to also be part of this free education grant. In short, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total budget for free education grant this year which includes the increase in VAT, it is $68.9 million as of 24 th November, 2023, the total utilization for ECE is about 20 percent, primary schools is about 44 percent and secondary schools is about 51 percent; in terms of dollar value primary schools is $35.1 million and secondary schools is $30.8 million and ECE is $2.9 million. Sir, the review of this handbook will be done through consultations with relevant stakeholders and we also will accommodate the assessment and see whether and how other free education grants have been used by respective schools. What we see is that most of the classrooms in the rural and remote areas have limited number of students or less number of students and they are affected by the amount of the free education grant that is usually given to them as compared to those schools in the city and town areas. For the boarding grant, in 2023-2024 the boarding per capita grant for Non-Government schools, for secondary schools has increased this year: from $50 per year to $150 per student. The boarding per capita is budgeted at secondary school level of $301,800 and primary $459,600 for the current financial year. The rate remains the same for Non-Government Primary Schools of $50 per child with total utilisation for boarding grant for primary schools, it is 18 percent and boarding grant for secondary schools is 2 percent. The Free Education Grant and Boarding per capita grant for Non- Government Schools as per budget under SEG 6 of the Budget Book which are also VAT inclusive. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to Honourable Rinesh Ritesh Sharma who raised a supplementary question I just want to acknowledge, honourable Members, those in the gallery. These are the staff of the Department of Immigration led by one Rasieli Rabukawaqa. They are here to familiarise themselves with the Parliamentary Process and it is indeed and honour to receive you, ladies and gentlemen. We hardly get visits from civil servants so this is quite encouraging because you have here some that have already served their time as civil servants. They are interested in Parliament, they have graduated to Parliament but the engine room is with you all. Civil Service is the engine room of any government that comes in. So, we acknowledge your presence and the honourable Members have already made known their acknowledgement and we wish you well in your journey here and also in your careers, vinaka vakalevu. I now offer the floor to honourable Rinesh Sharma. They are pointing at each other as to which one to go first.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2322 End of Week Statements 24 th Nov., 2023</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I will let him go first:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> After this, then we will jump straight to the next item which is the End of the Week Statements.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> I will allow him, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. One of the main reason for the introduction of Free Education Grant was to ensure that schools provide good teaching resources to students and teachers and also provide good teaching/learning environment. The other reason was to stop levying students and parents. Now it is noted with great concern that students/parents are heavily levied by some schools. Parents are raising serious concerns regarding levy. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. H. CHAND.- We have received some concerns from parents that the schools are levying the students and parents. We have got evidence. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Which school? HON. H. CHAND.- My question is, what is the Ministry doing about this? HON. K. K. LAL.- Shame on you! HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- This goes back to the preparation of teachers from the Ministry of Education. They need to be trained. The honourable Member was a Director - Human Resources, Head of Human Resources. The teachers were not properly trained in terms of financial management of Free Education Grant and therefore these are some of the things that this current Ministry is trying to address in terms of providing proper training to those that are responsible in terms of the management of the grant. For the levying of the fees to parents, I have just addressed earlier that the Ministry usually gives due consideration to the respective Heads of School. We do not have a standardised policy and this is something that we are working on to ensure that there are enrolment policies for all schools, given the respective ownerships of the schools, some are government-owned, some are faith-based owned, some are community/management-owned, so these are some things that we will have to take into consideration in terms of formulating the policy for enrolment for the respective schools.</p></body>
