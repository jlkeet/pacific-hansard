<body><h3>ADJOURNMENT</h3><h4>ADJOURNMENT</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I move: That Parliament adjourns until Monday, 4 th March, 2024 at 10.00 a.m.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that concludes the end of our sitting for this week and this session and I thank you all for all your contributions throughout the week and also this first session of Parliament. We have completed one year of sitting. Honourable Members, at this juncture, I wish to advise that Parliament will stand prorogued from Monday, 4 th December, 2023. By convention, this is not a sitting day, prorogation signifies the formal end of a parliamentary session or year during the parliamentary term which is four years. The Speaker will inform his Excellency the President of the prorogation as well as the State Opening of Parliament and the Session on Monday, 4 th March, 2024. The State Opening will be officiated by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji. We will ensure that we will be communicating and listening to the decision of the honourable Prime Minister and the Government. Once Parliament is prorogued, parliamentary business including parliamentary sittings and parliamentary standing committeesâ€™ proceedings on Bills, motions and reports are suspended or ceased until the opening of a new parliamentary session, with the exception of matters that will be deemed urgent and necessary such as the standing committee work on Bills, but this will be at the discretion of the Speaker. Since this will be our last sitting for this session of Parliament, I would like to wish all honourable Members and for each and everyone sitting in the gallery and those watching the live proceedings and everyone in Fiji a very Merry Christmas and a prosperous 2024. I also would like to wish the honourable Prime Minister and his entourage, including this Office well on the journey to attend the COP28 meeting in Dubai. Once again, thank you so much, and I now declare Parliament adjourned until Monday, 4 th March, 2024 at 10.00 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.20 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38</p></body>
