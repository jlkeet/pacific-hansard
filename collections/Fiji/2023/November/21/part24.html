<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK 2020-2021 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK 2020-2021 ANNUAL REPORT HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Report on the Fiji Development Bank 2020-2021 Report in July early this year. The Committee noted the Fiji Development Bank achieved a net profit of $0.99 million, in comparison to $1.14 million in the 2020 Financial Year. Furthermore, the lending portfolio recorded profits for both years: $541.88 million in 2020 and it grew to $618 million in 2021, despite COVID-19. The Fiji Development Bank witnessed the impacts of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, tropical cyclones and subsequent floods. The Bank then implemented the strategies that prioritised business continuity and resilience. The Committee received submissions from the Chief Executive Officer of Fiji Development Bank (FDB); government ministries and other relevant institutions such as the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council and Business Assistance Fiji to understand the assistance they provide to FDB customers. The Committee identified the gaps and duplications amongst stakeholders and recognised the need for collaborative efforts between the government ministries and other stakeholders to assist the applicants and customers of FDB to succeed in their business venture. The Committee was updated on the Agro-Photovoltaic project in Levuka. It was noted that there were delays in its implementations and request for urgent action to be taken by Government to expedite the commencement of the project. The Committee commends the bank in assisting several customers with working capital loans during the pandemic by borrowing from the Reserve Bank of Fiji through its Disaster Recovery and Contentment Facility. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate. Before I offer the floor, I have a list from the honourable Whips and the speakers are: (1) honourable Semi Koroilavesau; (2) honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; and (3) honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before going into the FDB Report, let me just highlight a correction on the issue on PAFCO. I wanted to talk to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica and highlight the issue, but I could not get the honourable Minister for Fisheries to be there so that I can double check that the facts that I was going to state are correct, that is why I am highlighting it. Firstly, licences: Licences are restricted to 60 and they are all local companies that fish within Fiji’s EEZ. If any other foreign vessel that is licensed in Fiji, it is licensed to unload and load, establish their business here but they fish outside the open waters or in other territorial EEZ of other neighbouring countries. Secondly, is the unloading of catches. For PAFCO, this is driven by price so most of the fishing vessels that come here are attracted to more better pricing overseas and they prefer to be loaded into containers and sent out especially for raw tuna.</p><p>2082 Consolidated Review Report – FDB 2020-2021 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 Thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report of FDB for 2020 to 2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will comment on the findings and recommendation by the Economic Affairs Committee. The Committee noted the increase in not performing loan portfolio during the period under review. The Committee recommends the strong collaboration of FDB, government ministries and other stakeholders to assist the clients of FDB in improving operations of their business. I will highlight this later in my contribution because it is one of the issues that is affecting the operation of FDB. There seems to be some disconnections with the sporting ministries, live agencies especially with Ministry of Fisheries and Ministry of Agriculture, Small Enterprises. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted a good opportunity that is provided by government agency called Business Assistance Fiji (BAF). That small agency actually can help especially for iTaukei landowners that would like to go into business. The BAF has a small office (I think in Victoria Parade) it is only consists of three and they have Government fundings. What they do is, they take in the project, they work it and then they allocate a consultant to help the small businesses to go to the various bank agency in Fiji to assist them to obtain their loan. I will highly recommend to small businesses to go through BAF if they want to improve their opportunity to get loans from loaning agencies. The Committee noted after thorough discussions with FDB as I have alluded to that Government Ministries really need to coordinate their activities in conjunction with the loan portfolios that have been given out by FDB. It is a development bank, and we appreciate the fact that they actually have a lot of threats that can damage their loan portfolio. It is very important for Government agencies and Government Ministries to assist them to work through the repayment and schedules that have been set with our local population especially our resource owners in our communities. The Committee was pleased to note that the Fiji Development Bank dedicated a section of its report to include the progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that was relevant to them. In 2020 the bank has its financial solution such as the Agriculture Family Loan facility that ensures women are actively involved in business as well as promotes the use of renewable energy projects within farms as solar irrigations. Further the bank exports credit facility, imports substitution and export finance facility and other financial available for the agriculture sector which contribute towards achieving various targets in the National Development Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly one of the highlights of our review was the Northern Development Programme (NDP) and we highly recommended that the other Divisions in Fiji follow that pattern because it has materialised and uplifted the lives of our people in the Northern Division. We have suggested that the other Division in Fiji follow suit and do the similar investment through NDP and I would urge Government to imitate that to the other Divisions to assist our local people to invest in our economy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute towards the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Development Bank 2020-2021 Annual Report. Before I commence, I would like to thank the Standing Committee for doing a marvellous job in assessing the Report as well as come up with very practical observations as well as considerations. The Fiji Development Bank, Mr. Speaker, Sir, plays a pivotal role in the promotion of development in the rural areas and most importantly in the agriculture sector. This is one of the key mandate of the Fiji Development Bank that is clearly stipulated in the Fiji Development Act 1966. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with agriculture as a key sector which benefits the most, the 2020-2021</p><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – FDB 2020-2021 Annual Report 2083 Annual Report has highlighted that FDB has closed to 51 percent of the total market share in Fiji. In the agriculture sector of its 91 percent of these loans are in the category of sugarcane farming. Therefore, it is very encouraging to witness such expensive assistance to our sugarcane farmers. However, I also urge FDB management to also fund innovative solutions and packages for other sub- sectors of agri-business. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, echoing the sentiments shared by the Standing Committee to venture out to other non-sugar sectors and unconventional farming projects, such as, agricultural value chain, financing which was piloted with a baby ginger industry. Despite there is a decline in the loan portfolio from 2019 to 2022, in 2019 it was $110 million, by the end of 2022, it has gone down to $91 million, even though there is a decline, there is room for improvement. The FDB management to encourage a review of the products that are currently on hand as well as the promotion and participation of our people in the agricultural sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as also alluded to earlier by honourable Koroilavesau, I think there is a need for the Bank to actually review the import substitution facility as well as the export financial facility with the Reserve Bank of Fiji to ensure that there is a promotion of activities. We are still importing more rice and lamb chops from overseas, so there is opportunity there to venture into sheep farming. I believe we are working with the Ministry of Agriculture, we should be able to venture into some of these industries which is going to impact the economy greatly. We urge the FDB management to consider increasing sector portfolio, market share to reserve related ventures, business process, outsourcing projects and sustainable renewal energy projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FDB is accredited to the Green Climate Fund being the first development bank in the South Pacific to achieve this amazing achievement. Through the Green Climate Fund, the Bank undertook the first agrophotovoltaic project in Fiji and the region. It is a great initiative for Levuka, however, due to unfortunate delays, this project has to be realised. I urge those involved in the project to work towards setting realistic targets and achieving results for our old capital. Another issue that was raised was the large number of portfolios because of the effects of COVID-19. It is very important for the Board and the management to device immediate plans in the recovery of payment of those loans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as aptly highlighted by the Standing Committee, FDB as well as the Business Assistance Fiji to work closely in assisting the loan applications over the potential Micro Small and Medium Enterprise clients. With those few words, I once again thank the FDB Board and management for the 2020 and 2021 Annual Report and I hereby support the motion. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for their contribution, and also the Chairman of the Committee for the presentation of the Report and highlighting some of the key issues within the Bank in the period of the review. The Bank’s history is one which has been tasked to stimulate and facilitate the promotion of development of natural resources, in particular, agriculture sector, transportation and other MSMEs. My first job, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was with FDB and I remember the late Laisenia Qarase used to be the Managing Director of the Bank. Even then the focus of the Bank was Small, Medium Enterprises, unsecured loans and many of them, a good percentage of those who helped by the Bank would go on and develop further. The Bank, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has already embarked. We have a new Board, and the management are working very well. They were embarked on a new five-year strategic plan. The focus will be a value driven organisation. We expect the Bank to create a more open, less hierarchical organisation by having few layers between the staff and management. Obviously, the interaction of</p><p>2084 Consolidated Review Report – FDB 2020-2021 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 the Board with the Management in a much more inclusive and closer manner is expected to produce those results and allow the Bank to implement the strategic plan in a much better way. Just on the Report for the review period, Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously the Bank has gone through a lot of experience and learning exercises in terms of the natural disaster by providing financial assistance and supporting the business continuity and recovery of some of the businesses at that time. Obviously concerns about the Non-Performing Loans (NPL). Again, transition from COVID, we saw a lot of growth in 2022 and now in 2023 the Bank is obviously on a much better footing in terms of recovery. And because of the strong growth in the economy, strong performance of not only the tourism sector but also a very strong pick-up in business generally has allowed the Bank to improve its repayments and we expect the Non-Performing Loans to decline much faster. The Bank is also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, working very closely with the different ministries and honourable Koroilavesau is correct. I think some of the key Ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry ought to work very closely with the Fiji Development Bank. These are some of the things that we have talked about before in this Parliament where we said that the FDB’s mandate really should be to focus on supporting Small Medium Enterprises, particularly those in the natural resource-based sectors. On that, Mr. Speaker, the good news about the Bank’s future, the FDB has been producing recently very remarkable results in terms of not only the change from very low profit to increase in profit in 2022, but the most important feature that we see is the doubling of the account holders from 4,500 to around 9,300 in 2023. It looks like that the Bank is on track to hit the 10,000 mark very soon. I think it is an indication of the refocus and the close cooperation between the FDB board and the management team and I want to thank the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Darmend Gounder, CEO and the management for taking on board the Government’s vision and priority in terms of supporting the Small Medium Enterprises. The launch of the FDB Loan for Women Entrepreneurs, in the last four months, I am told that the Bank received 4,000 applications, approved about 1,000 loans totalling about $2.5 million. In terms of the overall figure, Sir, it may not sound very big but if you are looking at thousand loans individually, it proves the point that the Bank is really focusing on the small, medium enterprises and the pleasing thing is that these are women entrepreneurs who are actually engaging with the Bank. Most of it is unsecured loans so in other words they do not need any security, all they have to do is to present good proposals, the Bank will assess it and if the feasibility shows that it is going to be successful, they get that as well. The other point in relation to this, all these applications came digitally, it was launched very early this year. A lot of the women who were applying, they actually expanded the reach to outer islands such as Batiki, Cikobia, Gau, Kadavu, Koro, Lakeba, Moala, Moce, Moturiki, Ovalau, Rotuma and Vanuabalavu. All these were done digitally (online applications). Again it is a good innovation and it will allow the Bank to improve its financial literacy programme as well. In fact earlier this year they also launched a new financial literacy programme and that I think is going to bring the Bank back to one of the key original objectives and that is to support the small, medium enterprises and more particularly those which are linked with the natural resource sectors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I want to thank the Chairman, Board and the management for taking on the new approaches and making sure that the Bank is getting back on its original objectives</p><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 2085 and also on a good financial footing. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution towards the Report. As highlighted by some honourable Members, it is critical that FDB and other stakeholders forge strong partnership. The issue of access to non-sugarcane farmers has been highlighted and it is very critical and perhaps more allocation and attention to be given to the non-sugarcane sector. Sir, FDB has formulated other innovative products towards women and SMEs and we should encourage FDB to continue along this innovative path. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
