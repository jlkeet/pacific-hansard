The floor is yours, Sir. Government Policy on International Conflicts HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise under the authority of Standing Order 40 to</p><h4>make a Ministerial Statement on Government policy on international conflicts.</h4><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I, make this Statement with a background of conflict going on around the world. Some of it could affect some of our peacekeepers on duty in the Middle East at the moment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just come back from the meeting in San Fransisco, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Meeting, where we had the opening cocktails on Wednesday of last week, at the end of which there was a very lively fireworks display. The welcome reception was put on by the Mayor of San Fransisco. There was very lively fireworks, and as some of us were enjoying the fireworks, I was quietly thinking of the young people in Russia and Ukraine, and also those in Gaza and Israel. What they would be doing, particularly the children, when they saw or heard loud bangs around them. They very quickly learned to know whether it is incoming or outgoing, and they would take necessary and needed actions to stay safe. On the following morning at the Roundtable of the Leaders present at the APEC Meeting, I mentioned that at the function the previous evening, and I said, “Your Majesty (there was a king there), Excellency’s, and honourable Prime Ministers, I do not know what you were thinking about last night when we were having the firework displays. I was thinking about the young children, the young people in Gaza and Israel, and also those in Russia and Ukraine.” Then there was the other thought that perhaps, we were celebrating the four-hour long meeting held by President Biden, who was sitting opposite me, and President Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, who was sitting towards my right. I said, “I thought we were celebrating their summit. I thought we were aware that these two men, between them, can bring peace to the world. And I encouraged them to continue to talk to those who were engulfed in conflicts around the globe at this time. I also told them, “Around this table, I am the only former peacekeeper present. I, and our troops now are called to go and keep the peace in conflict that had nothing to do with us but have gravely affected us in our cost of living, cost to us and lost lives.” It attracted a lot of attention, and I am glad to say that 48 hours after that, peace negotiations had started around the world. This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak a Ministerial Statement as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to elaborate on Government policy on international conflicts. We make our views and our stance based on rules based on international order and decision-making. This morning, Sir, I received an envelope on my table from those who were trying to attract international attention towards the alleged atrocities suffered by our kinsmen - the Papuans, the Melanesians of Indonesia. I am glad that in the discussion I had with President of Indonesia, I did not mention West Papua or Papua as their concern, but my colleague, the honourable Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea mentioned it. And we have been asked by the Pacific Islands Forum of Leaders in the Melanesian Spearhead Group to spearhead the Pacific’s attempt to get attention focused on the people of West Papua. After our discussion with the President of Indonesia, he invited me to make that State visit and I hope it does not interfere with the parliamentary programme that we have. In fact, I would plan it so that we do not interfere with the sitting of Parliament next year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we may be</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2016</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 small, we may not have the power to influence the economies of the world. But we enjoy a profile in international peacekeeping, and thanks to those who serve in the Mr. Speaker, Sir, we may be small, we may not have the power to influence the economies of the world. But we enjoy a profile in international peacekeeping, and thanks to those who serve in the Military and peacekeeping efforts, thanks to those who started the idea - the late Ambassador Berenado Vunibobo, the late Colonel Paul Manueli and the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara during their time of leadership and representatives of Fiji. We, at the moment, would like to continue to make our decisions based on rules-based international order and decision-making. When we participate in global debates or consider resolutions, we prioritise the sovereignty of UN Member States, as outlined in the United Nations Conventions. Our approach is premised on the determination of whether the issue at hand affects the sovereignty of States recognised as part of the United Nations. States are signatories, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and parties to international conventions and rules set out by the United Nations. By our very membership of this world body, we hold each other accountable to that standard. How do we deal with non-State actors and proxies? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of accountability raises the question of what happens if and/or when non-State actors or proxies are involved in international conflicts? Where these entities initiate conflicts and ignore the international rules governing corresponding conducts, including the laws of wars, who will come for them, or precisely, how can they be made accountable? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in the UNDA when the group of pilgrims from Fiji were preparing to go to Israel. My wife and a girl from home were on the passenger list. I called the organisers, and I called home and said, “Please, cross off my wife’s name.” Master Mika asked, “Why, Sir?”. I said, “They will be there on 7 th October, 2023, which is a Saturday.” He asked, “What has that got to do with the trip?” I said, “That is the 50 th Anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.” I asked my wife to excuse me for that, but on the afternoon of Saturday, 7 th October, as the people of Navatu were having a meeting remembering the Republic Day of Fiji before the Fiji Day Celebrations on the following Monday, word came out that the war had broken up on Saturday, 7 th October, 2023 - 50 years exactly to the day the Yom Kippur War started. We had to work out how we were going to extract our pilgrims. We got the co-operation of Fiji Airways, we got the co-operation of our Embassies, of our Permanent Representative in the United Nations, who arranged with all the countries over which Fiji Airways would fly, to be on standby should we need refuelling coming back because we would not have had time for Fiji Airway to refuel on the ground. We got word that the Iron Dome had been activated, that no missiles would fall on Ben Gurion Airport, we had cleared the air route, Fiji Airways was on standby in Singapore with full fuel tanks, which meant they could not bring back all the passengers. They could bring back everyone who went but not the others who did not go by the charter flight. We managed to do that, Sir, because we have a very good reputation with countries around the world who are willing to cooperate with Fiji Airways should they need to refuel on the way back. The flight returned, picked up our passengers and came back. Sadly, while they were on board, they heard the news that the Mayor, who had entertained them two days before the conflict broke out, had been killed in the kibbutz he was defending as the Mayor in the very first assault into Israel.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2017 Mr. Speaker, Sir, battlelines nowadays are not drawn. All former military men know that Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) is no longer applicable. There is no longer an FEBA. The enemy is no longer in uniform and wears no rank. Things are very difficult. Definitions and identities of combatants are no longer discernible. These are the nature of conflicts that we have to think about in our role as leaders in the legislative assemblies of nations, so far remote from the conflicts yet suffer most of the effects. Such things as human shields that we used to read about are reality in the conflicts of today. The brutal atrocities we thought might be fiction in a lot of things we see and read and view on social media are real, but we must abide by the international standard that we uphold. And, that is, we respect the sovereignty of nations, and we must also continue to serve to the best of our interest and the interest of the world because I believe we are there, we believe it is for the world that we have our peacekeepers out there. Sir, we have our own faith, our own religion, and we also have our own sovereignty to protect. Our policy stance on managing international conflicts, we respect the sovereign integrity of States. We stand for non-aggression, for non-interference in domestic affairs of States and the resolution of conflicts by peaceful means in line with Chapter VI of the UN Charter. When it comes to the required action with respect to threats to peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression, Fiji is guided by Chapter VII of the UN Charter. At the same time, and as a sovereign State, Fiji does not take a position simply because it is popular, or because it is the easy way out. Instead, we will stand for truth, for what is right, even though this may not be pragmatic at times because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the very principles we stand for as expressed under Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the UN Charter, demonstrates our belief in the sacro-sanctity of life, in truthfulness and human decency, in good faith and accountability - that no meaningful and durable solution will come out from situations where a party to a conflict refuses to take responsibility for its actions. How else can a doctrine of consent be applied when it comes to an agreed third party role? Mr. Speaker, Sir, from an ethical standpoint, the embracing arms of forgiveness and acceptance can only come from admission and repentance. Therein lies the dignity of life and peace restoration, built on truth in the One in whom we live and move and have our being. This is Fiji’s hope for the world. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make his response. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his elaboration on the policy that the Government has on international conflicts and how this is consistent with the Foreign Affairs Policy of being friends to all and enemies of none. He has explained at length talking about the people that went to Israel as part of the trip earlier on and I am glad to see some of the things that he mentioned. Listening to the words I am trying to put things together to see how they gel up with what the Government has actually done and the great words that have been expressed by the honourable Prime Minister. Our Foreign Policy, Mr, Speaker, Sir, I believe must always serve our national interest: our national interest of today and our national interest of the future. This must be fundamental at all times. It is not an easy thing to do because sometimes we are at pressure to do things that others want us to</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2018</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 do. It is also very important that the Foreign Policy must reflect our values. One of these key values is humanity. The honourable Prime Minister has talked about the important role that is made in terms of peacekeeping: peacekeeping today in the Middle East there are between 15,000 to 20,000 people that have passed away. At least 6,000 children. I do not know what the figures are in places like Ukraine. What those numbers are but this morning, I just googled those numbers. I think this value of humanity must be crucial in everything that we stand for. We are a country that stands for humanity. We have stood for climate change because climate change impacts on humanity. We have stood at the forefront of this world and shouted these matters to everyone. When you are for climate change you are for humanity. So, I am saying from our part this key value of humanity we must never deviate from it if people are dying around the world. Humanity is also about the lives of our peacekeepers. If you are going to make decisions at the United Nations, we need to be very careful that they are not decisions that might impact the lives of our very own peacekeepers that are in that part of the world, and I know that the honourable Prime Minister is a former peacekeeper knows that and that is our concern that we have. When we make decisions whether we support this motion or that motion in the United Nations, we have to think about humanity around the world, humanity of our very own people. As I talked about this today, they were talking about the causes for humanitarian issues. I think humanitarian focus on humanity must be critical in all our notions that we have. Mr. Speaker, in doing this the perception of what the honourable Prime Minister had said that we need to be able to stand on our own feet and not be pushed by the powers that be whoever they are and we totally agree with this. We must not try to appease people just because they are strong. Our sense of who we are must not be bought by anyone else. So, the sentiments are there we want to see that this is implemented well. We maintain that we maintain the importance of humanity, the importance of our people, the importance of this world to make sure that it is preserved for all the future generations. The words I heard from the Government, I look forward to seeing the execution to make it really happen where the rubber hits the road, where people’s lives are saved, where children can grow up to become adults. The babies that are in incubators are not killed because they have done nothing wrong at all. That is our great concern, honourable Prime Minister, so thank you for those words. Please, maintain the interests of this country. Maintain our values and do not be torn asunder by the perceptions that people have when they want us to do what they want to do for their own benefit. We must do what is in the best interest of the world, of our people and our country. Google South Pacific Connect Initiative and Google’s Investment in Fiji HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today to make a Ministerial Statement on Google South Pacific Connect Initiative and Google’s Investment in Fiji (in short at which it will be known: the Tabua Cable Connection). Let me just say Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the history of this Government is written in years to come, the creation of the Tabua Cable is the collaboration between the tech giant, Google, and the Government of Fiji will go down as a major achievement and significant building block in rebuilding the economic architecture in the new Fiji. (Honourable Members interject)</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2019 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Let me say again, when the history of this Government is written, the creation of the Tabua Cable will go down as a major achievement and a significant building block in the rebuilding of the economic architecture of the new Fiji. HON. P. K. BALA.- Where is your dagger? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, today, I wish to share some information on this transformative investment and why, as Minister of Communications and by extensions naturally, the People’s Government is very excited about this partnership with Google and the further opportunities, we believe, this initiative will unlock for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative aligns well with the Coalition Government’s long-term goal of diversifying the economy, progressing into a more digital economy and cementing Fiji as the hub of the Pacific. We not only speak about it, but we also actually do it. We make it happen. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash … HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to start, please, allow me to share some details on Google South Pacific Connect Initiative. (Honourable Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Listen, you’ll learn something.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- We have nothing to learn:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Google will establish and lay a new sub:</span> sea cable that will link United States, Fiji, Australia and French Polynesia. Google will lay the Tabua Cable which will connect the United States, Australia and Fiji and additionally, Google will lay a second cable dubbed the “Honomoana cable”, connecting the United States to French Polynesia and onward to Australia. There is also potential to eventually link Fiji to Japan and Fiji to Chile through South America. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Google plans an interlinking subsea cable connecting Fiji and French Polynesia. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- When did you start the negotiation with Google? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, listen! (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, Google plans for the interlinking subsea cables connecting Fiji and French Polynesia will truly make Fiji the technological hub of the Pacific and continue this desire, and this is another thing that differentiates us from them. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- When we do things, we do things for other Pacific Islands, with the Pacific. This investment Mr. Speaker, Sir, will open up the technology to whole of the Pacific. HON. J. USAMATE.- Who started the discussions with Google?</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>2020</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- This ring will include pre-positioned branching units that will allow other Pacific Islands.... Let me address that question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They were mucking around with Google. (Laughter) Google approached them, they were mucking around with Google. In seven months, we got it done. (Honourable Members interject) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- When we met Google, they said, “We have been talking to these guys, they are not talking to us.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- You were talking to Fiji Water all the time:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Look at him:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> No action, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with too much talk.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Very good action:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Seven months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are bringing our transformative investment into this country. This ring that I am talking about will include pre- positioned branching units that will allow the Pacific Island countries and territories to take advantage of the reliability, diversity and resilience resulting from this initiative. The President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Australia announced their support for the Google Pacific Connect Initiative on the 25 th October this year providing funding for some of the branching units which will allow for potential future submarine cable connections to other Pacific Island countries. The South Pacific Connect Initiative is a collaborative effort with Google making a significant step in the advancement of digital infrastructure in the Pacific region. It is one of the first projects of its kind in the Pacific providing the ability to bring redundant international connectivity to a region that is susceptible to natural disasters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, listen to this - Google will also construct a diverse cable landing station and ICT facility in Fiji which will create the first Tier III data centre in the Pacific improving reliability, adding capacity and reducing latency for users in the Pacific and around the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one would ask, “why is Google Pacific Connect Investment and Googles investment in Fiji important to us? With Googles investment in the Pacific Connect Initiative their plan to construct a diverse cable landing station and ICT facility this is a game changing initiative for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The estimated investment by Google into Fiji is FJ$200 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have spoken in this august Parliament about the initiatives to turbocharge the economy. This, in itself, has the potential to turbocharge, diversify and strengthen the economy and more.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2021 HON. K. K. LAL.- Are you the new Minister of Finance? (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, even prior to becoming a politician, I have been very supportive of the BPO and outsource sector in Fiji and vocal for the need of an additional landing station and submarine cable connectivity to provide redundancy, greater connectivity, reduce risk in the case of a cable being damaged. I am pleased to say to the people of Fiji this has now come to pass.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you FijiFirst:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> I am not sure if the Members of this august Parliament are aware, but with Viti Levu having one cable station, if something goes wrong, God-forbid, we would be severely and adversely affected. The risk is there, and we saw this in Tonga two years ago. The economic impact if Fiji were to lose connectivity would be severe, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Imagine not having internet connectivity for an extended period in this day and age. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government acknowledges that developing resilient infrastructure is critical to development advancement and we have prioritised supporting initiatives such as this, initiatives that have the ability to not only strengthen the ICT infrastructure but revolutionise digital connectivity in Fiji and the region providing a robust and reliable network, vital backup, expanded capacity and minimising delay for users in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk briefly about some of the high-level benefits that the South Pacific Connect Initiative and Google’s investment will have in Fiji. Sir, we anticipate long- term economic benefit of this investment to Fiji, and it will be significant. First, the fact that a global multinational technology company like Google is investing in Fiji shows investor confidence. The fact that we did it in seven months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has placed much more confidence (Google) in Fiji as opposed to the other side that marked them around for almost two years. With the additional submarine cables, increased infrastructure investments and improved digital network infrastructure, there is an opportunity for greater international internet bandwidth capacity, faster internet speed, potential cost savings to Fiji, increased resilience and reduce latency.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Levu na vosa:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You might learn something:</span></p><p>Improved network infrastructure will support new and emerging technologies including frontier technologies such as, Artificial Intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, Quantum Computing, and will have the potential to make the greatest progress in areas such as, education, agriculture, communications, medicine, manufacturing and combating climate change. Now I have made them quiet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not forget the economic impact. The estimated impact from the new subsea cable infrastructure on Fiji’s economy and society will include a higher economic output and supporting employment directly attributed to the market effects of this new cable infrastructure. By 2030, it is estimated that the economic output over seven years will reach approximately US$295 million and has the potential to create almost 3,600 jobs economy wide.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2022</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 This is very conservative, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The above economic output and job estimates excludes the economic contribution of building and operating subsea cable infrastructure. Just as important, this new subsea cable would act as a catalyst for new digital technology-enabled opportunities. This investment will greatly support the Fiji Business Process Outsourcing sector, by not only offering greater network infrastructure, but by reducing the risks mentioned earlier. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this investment would also provide further confidence backed by this greater infrastructure for current and new BPO investors to consider investing and expanding their investments in Fiji. You can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is a major interest in Fiji right now. This will lead to increased employment and economic activity in the BPO sector. The BPO sector has the potential to provide 25,000 jobs and contribute greatly to Fiji’s GDP. This initiative further supports the business case for greater investment in the BPO and outsource sector. Improved digital connectivity and greater network infrastructure leads to technologies supporting social objectives, such as, digital technology in healthcare and education and even disaster management, to name are few. Online digital education programmes will enable people to develop new skills and open up new additional career opportunities. In Fiji, Google is collaborating with key stakeholders - FINTEL and FNPF. These partnerships will strengthen Fiji and FINTEL’s telecommunications hub status, and also provide much needed reliability, resilience and connectivity between the people of the Pacific and the rest of the world. We also believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Fiji’s institutional investors, such as FNPF, Fijian Holdings and BSP Life, may have an opportunity to invest in the Tabua Cable. This is also an excellent opportunity for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is no secret that this Government, the People’s Government is very excited about this initiative and this investment in this country. It is a big deal and will have real economic benefits for the people of Fiji. I wish to assure the people of Fiji, we are just getting warmed up, and this Government not only talks, it actually walks the walk and takes action. Remember that! Before I end, I would like to acknowledge all the collaborators who have taken part in this initiative from the team at Google, to the Office of the Prime Minister, the honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, Investment Fiji and the Trade Commissioner at the Trade Commission Office, Mr. Alika Cooper, and finally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Fiji. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We did it in seven months:</span></p><p>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for making this contribution. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate for their response. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to reply to the Ministerial Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and I thank him for his Statement. Connectivity is a must for development and modernisation. One of the biggest pillars in strategies for the FijiFirst Government was to modernise Fiji and the connectivity … HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2023 HON. K. K. LAL.- And we did it! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- … that we have right now is as a result of that strategy to modernise the nation. In the margins of the 77 th General Assembly, the honourable Prime Minister met with Google in Washington and started off this discussion on Google Investment in Fiji and for the honourable Deputy Prime Minister just to … HON. K. K. LAL.- Listen, listen! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- … whitewash it and say that this is just their own, is a lie. We started it all in October. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He is a liar:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, connectivity has both good and bad sides to it. We hear the benefits it will bring to Fiji but there is a bad side to connectivity, and it is called cybercrime. The Budapest Convention, which is the Convention on Cybercrime, was brought to Parliament, we dealt with it in the Committee and the honourable Attorney-General was supposed to come back to Parliament and move a motion that Fiji ratifies this Convention. That is the smart way of doing things. When you have connectivity, you make sure that you cover yourself from the negative aspects of connectivity and we are still waiting for that motion to come to Parliament so that Fiji can ratify the Budapest Convention so that we can partner with those countries that are at the forefront of fighting cybercrime. Yes, connectivity is good, it is good for development, it is good for modernisation, but we must not forget the downside to it. That Convention will help the nation to curb the downside of having connectivity. You open up the internet nowadays, everyone has a phone, for kids, you open it up, you open to the ideologies of extremists of the world. We have dealt with that Cybercrime Convention and we are hoping that the honourable Attorney-General can bring it to Parliament so that Fiji can ratify. I would also like to mention that yesterday, the honourable Prime Minister said that the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (BBNJ) Treaty that he signed had already come to Parliament and with the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I would like to correct it that it has not come to Parliament, he definitely got bad advice. The BBNJ was just drafted, I think, in March 2023. I am expecting the Solicitor-General or the honourable Attorney-General to bring a motion to Parliament so that Parliament can then push that across to the Committee and we can come back to Parliament for ratification of the BBNJ. Yes, that cable will help Fiji, it is good for our country, it is good for development but please do not forget the bad side to it. I certainly hope that we can ratify that Cybercrime Convention (Budapest Convention) which helps us in dealing with the downside to connectivity. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for tea. For those in the gallery, you are also invited to share some tea with the honourable Members of Parliament. The Parliament adjourned at 10.40 a.m.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 11.14 a.m. National State of Preparedness by the National Disaster Management Office HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, ni sa bula vinaka. I rise in this august Parliament today to share some ongoing initiatives that are part of the disaster preparedness works undertaken by the Ministry through the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO). Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, please, allow me to provide a brief historical background of natural disaster events that we have witnessed over the years. As we know, Fiji is situated in a region prone to various environmental hazards, including cyclones, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis. These natural calamities have, over the years, brought about devastating consequences, prompting the Government to prioritise disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts. In response, our team at the NDMO has embarked on ongoing initiatives aimed at enhancing the nation's resilience and preparedness in the face of natural disasters. To understand these initiatives, it is imperative to have a look at the historical background of natural disaster events that have plagued Fiji in the past. This historical perspective not only sheds light on the challenges faced by the country but also underscores the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of its people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) revealed that Fiji is expected to incur climate change-related losses equivalent to 4 percent of our annual GDP by the year 2100 due to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events, which will have adverse effects on agriculture and the broader economy. According to the study, Fiji is likely to experience increased droughts, floods, and temperature spikes by 2070 with a potential temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius from 1990 levels under a medium emissions scenario. Sea levels could also rise by as much as 1.41 metres by the year 2100. Contextualising reality with theory, Mr. Speaker, Sir, observed sea levels have been rising at a rate of 4 millimetres per year from 1992 to 2018. Additionally, over the past 75 years, there has been a noticeable increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events. For the Nadi River, out of 84 floods recorded since 1870, 54 flooding events alone occurred after 1980, with 26 major floods since 1991. In January 2009, major flooding resulted in tragic consequences, including at least 11 fatalities, displacement of 12,000 people and economic damages amounting to US$54 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, TC Yasa was the strongest tropical cyclone to have hit the South Pacific since TC Winston in 2016, and the fourth most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Southern Pacific Basin causing significant destruction to infrastructure, buildings and livelihoods. It was also the second severe tropical cyclone in 2020 after TC Harold, impacting Fiji during the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 24,413 people were displaced, four deaths with one missing person recorded with economic damages mounting to over US$100 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is of utmost significance to acknowledge that the heightened occurrence of flooding and cyclones cannot be attributed solely to rising sea levels, temperature increases, or extreme rainfall events. These consequences are compounded by the gradual silting and sedimentation of our river channels, primarily resulting from deforestation in the hinterland. Additionally, various forms of development have led to the depletion of a significant portion of our mangrove fringe, a critical natural barrier against flooding and coastal erosion. Therefore, the</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2025 imperative to take immediate action to prioritise resilience has never been more pressing than it is now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a significant concern for our small island nation is that 76 percent of our population resides within a 5-kilometre radius of the coast, making our homeland highly susceptible to future disasters. Forty-two vulnerable communities in Fiji have been identified for potential relocation. Our approach has transitioned towards involving disaster survivors in their own efforts to recover housing. Earlier this month, in partnership with the International Office of Migration (IOM) and Korea International Co-operation Agency (KOICA), we soft-launched the Evacuation Centre Retrofitting and Newly Built Guideline. This Guideline will undergo testing in all the evacuation centres that will be built and retrofitted through this project before it is finalised. It will also include a standard design for evacuation centres. Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster preparedness plays a critical role in the work of the NDMO due to the countries vulnerability as I have aforementioned. We recognise that being well prepared for disasters is essential to saving lives, reducing the impact of damages to infrastructure and effectively managing emergency response operations. The NMDO greatly appreciates the support received from its partners in its efforts to enhance disaster preparedness in Fiji. These partners, ranging from regional organisations to international aid agencies and donor countries have provided vital assistance in terms of financial resources, technical expertise and capacity building. With their support, the NDMO has been able to strengthen its capabilities in disaster response, early warning systems and community awareness programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture that I would like to acknowledge the New Zealand government for its investment of FJ$3.2 million towards providing support to improve disaster preparedness and response. The funding and support comprise a suite of interventions designed to increase the capacity of the NDMO to manage disaster awareness and response in Fiji. It will involve: • • • • technical assistance to the NDMO; upgrade of early warning and flood protection systems; construction of warehouses, upgrade of divisional Emergency Operation Centres; and development of information management system and preparedness and capacity building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working on upgrading the National Emergency Operations Centre for disaster preparedness and for monitoring and coordinating disaster response and relief operations. Some of our equipment that was damaged from TC Yasa will be upgraded to ensure efficiency during disaster operations. I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that in collaboration with the Korean National Disaster Management Institute, we are presently working on an ongoing project titled the “Construction of the Forecasting and Warning System for Disaster Reduction Project in Fiji.” We have installed flood early warning systems within the Ba Province Catchment, encompassing four rainfall stations, seven water level stations and six warning posts. The primary objective of this joint project is to offer early warning to vulnerable communities, facilitating timely evacuations to safeguard lives and properties during flood events. The project had commenced on 1 st May and is expected to conclude on 30 th November, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji will pilot an initiative in partnership with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Response (UNOCHA) to implement Anticipatory Action within</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2026</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 the Central Emergency Response Funds. This initiative will receive US$2 million through the Fiji Cluster System to support Government priorities during disasters. Anticipatory action aims to enhance existing Disaster Risk Reduction frameworks by enabling pro-active actions and financing to be initiated based on forecast of impending hazards rather than waiting to respond after the disaster has occurred. This approach is supported by growing evidence suggesting that taking action before a predictable shock occurs as both timely and cost effective, in addition to upholding human dignity. As an aside, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TC Mal if it had come directly towards Viti Levu, this would have kicked into anticipatory action, meaning that funds would be issued to targeted groups along the path of the cyclone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to share an update on an important development regarding Fiji’s disaster response capabilities. In March of this year, the Cabinet granted approval for the establishment of Fiji’s inaugural National Emergency Response Team (NERT). It is my pleasure to inform this esteemed Parliament that the first induction training for our dedicated first responders took place from 2 nd July to 9 th July, 2023. A total of 35 Government Officials across 19 agencies took part in the exercise. A training programme took place outdoors at the Ministry’s warehouse in Lautoka, where our participants were accommodated in the First Responders accommodation block on the premises. The training spent seven days and included a total of 85 learning hours with 24 hours dedicated to Simulation Exercise (SIMEX). The training sessions focused on disaster response scenarios, including standardised tools and methodologies for efficient disaster response, specifically the Tropical Cyclone Response scenario during the learning sessions, and Earthquake and Tsunami Response scenario during the simulation exercise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having Fiji's own National Emergency Response Team (NERT) is crucial for a swift and effective response to disasters, as it allows for local expertise, tailored strategies, community empowerment and enhanced collaboration with international partners. Together, these factors contribute to a more resilient and prepared Fiji in the face of emergencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the significance of investing in disaster preparedness, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has verified that investing just one US Dollar in risk reduction and prevention can save up to 15 US Dollars in post-disaster recovery. This reaffirms the significant impact and cost-effectiveness of prioritising risk reduction measures to mitigate the consequences of disasters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Cabinet’s approval for the National Emergency Response Team (NERT) mechanism, I am pleased to inform this Parliament that we had successfully completed a National Simulation Exercise focused on tsunami and earthquake scenarios marked as a key event in our National Disaster Awareness Week which was conducted from 12 th October to 18 th October, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Disaster Awareness Week is mandated by the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 to be conducted annually. This year’s Disaster Week was extra special, as we were graced by the attendance of Ms. Mami Mizutori, the Assistant Secretary-General and Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction at the UNDRR, marking it her first visit to the region.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2027 I would also like to thank the Office of His Excellency the President of Fiji, for His Excellency’s gracious presence on the day, supporting us in this worthy cause with his participation in the Tsunami Simulation Drill and presenting our guest, Ms. Mizutori, with our ‘thank you’ token at the closing of the Disaster Week. I would also like to thank all honourable Members of this august Parliament who had participated on that day. This year’s Disaster Awareness Week started with training conducted by the Australian Disaster Assessment Response Team for three days and the first of its kind on Urban Search and Rescue, followed by a Communication Sub Exercise, an Academic session, Tsunami Drill, Marine Search and Rescue, Oil Spill, Urban Search and Rescue, with two full days of a public exhibition in tents on Albert Park. The theme for this year's Disaster Awareness Week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was “Fighting Inequality for a Resilient Future”. It is a topic that not only underscores the challenges we face, but also the immense potential we have to create a more equitable and resilient world. In the realm of disaster risk reduction, we often discuss strategies, early warning systems and preparedness. While these are undeniably crucial, we must also recognise that disasters do not affect all individuals or communities equally. Inequality amplifies the impact of disasters and exacerbates the vulnerability of the marginalised and disadvantaged among us. Through our active engagement and the involvement of our disaster risk reduction community, we have evaluated our collective level of readiness concerning earthquake and tsunami scenarios. Organisations have also assessed their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). However, what is the most significant is the relationships building and network creation of our first responders - a worthy investment we witnessed first-hand during the TC Mal response. Mr. Speaker, allow me to provide an update on the preliminary damage assessment data analysis for TC Mal. Some districts are still conducting their assessments and we anticipate receiving more data by the end of this week. In the Ba Province, a total of four homes have sustained partial damage. Additionally, two households have reported damage to their sanitation facilities, while three households have reported damage to their kitchen. Three houses have experienced damage to their water supply systems, affecting 21 families. A team is currently deployed to the Yasawa Group of Islands to conduct an Initial Damage Assessment (IDA) and so far, majority of the damages reported are from their agriculture farms. Food rations have been deployed to alleviate suffering, while we collaborate with the Ministry of Agriculture to normalise their food security and livelihood. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023 National Disaster Awareness Week was, for the first time, where we tried out this scenario event where we attempted to simultaneously evacuate over 1,203 individuals from 16 different locations nationwide. This represents the largest scale evacuation exercise we have ever conducted at a national level. The seamless execution of this operation is a clear testament of the high level of professionalism that we now have in country. Based on these exercises, we are also comfortable that we can scale up evacuee numbers and locations nationwide, if the need arises. The evacuation encompassed a total of seven schools, one community, a hospital, the Suva Market, six businesses in the greater Suva area - all of which actively participated in the tsunami drill.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2028</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 I would like to thank them all for joining efforts with us and would like to extend a special acknowledgement to the Pacific Disability Forum for their valuable contribution to the drill. It is important to recognise that every individual’s wellbeing is of utmost importance, and we are all on this collective journey together. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my gratitude to our partners who collaborated with us in ensuring the success of the National Disaster Awareness Week - the New Zealand Government, the Australian Government, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the Pacific Community, UNDRR, UN Women, IFRC, UNICEF, UNOCHA, WFP, IOM, USAID and Walesi. Mr. Speaker, Sir, standing resolute in our commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind, we have extended invitations to our neighbouring countries. Over 10 Pacific Island Countries actively participated in the exercise, with the inclusion of their respective Red Cross Offices. Early this month, Sir, we completed our operational readiness checks for evacuation centres and emergency operation centres. These checks are crucial for assessing preparedness and effectiveness, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of individuals during emergencies and disasters. It was done just in time to coincide with TC Mal, and I suppose the results speak for themselves. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government committed to making a significant commitment towards mainstreaming of the 122 Action Items outlined in the National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy. This commitment will be executed through a coordinated effort across Government agencies and Civil Society Organisations, following a whole-of-society approach. I am pleased to update this august Parliament that we have circulated the first draft of the Western Division Disaster Risk Reduction Plan. This marks the first plan for Fiji when Disaster Risk Reduction is integrated into our planning and development. We intend to complete this plan once all disaster historical analysis are finalised and incorporated into the programme. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I express my gratitude to all the people of Fiji for their cooperation during TC Mal, despite uncertainties about the cyclone’s path. We successfully disseminated crucial lifesaving messages. The absence of casualties or injuries reflects remarkable collaboration and support from the public, businesses, the media and first responders. It is vital for all stakeholders, not just the Government, to unite during such times. Effective disaster response requires a collective effort and shared responsibility involving Government agencies, NGOs, community organisations, businesses and individuals. Collaborative preparedness activities, such as emergency planning, drills and resilient infrastructure investment, are key to minimising the impact of disasters and safeguarding lives and livelihoods. Early preparedness contributes to economic growth during emergencies when communities and households are ready with robust disaster plans and mitigation measures, the response and recovery processes become more efficient. Swift action and minimal disruption allow businesses to recover faster, saving jobs and ensuring continuity in livelihoods. This resilience not only protects the economy but also fosters confidence in investors, contributing to long-term economic growth and stability. It is essential to acknowledge that neglecting preparation is equivalent to preparing for failure. By working together and investing in early preparedness, we can bolster our resilience, protect our communities, and lay the foundation for economic growth even during times of emergency. With that, Sir, I thank this august Parliament for giving me this opportunity.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2029 MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to deliver their response. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bell was, indeed, loud enough for the honourable Minister to end his statement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, like the statement made by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications on Google, stating their excitement about the project, we are equally excited too from this side to see that they are continuing the work that we have started and it is not about the politics, it is about Fiji, Sir. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister yesterday talked about this great partnership and participation of honourable Koya and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition as part of the COP 28 delegation. We could be childish and refuse this, Sir, but we look at the big picture. This is about Fiji. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- We have served as Ministers for eight years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have a lot to offer this Government. So, I thank the honourable Minister for stating the state of preparedness, but this is nothing new. The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) is where it is today because of the leadership of FijiFirst. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, NDMO is where it is today because of the leadership of FijiFirst. No one can contest that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In 2016, as we prepared for the World Humanitarian Summit in Turkey, we came up with a statement and this was the main statement for the Pacific because we are linking the Sendai Framework, we are linking the SDG Goals, and we are also linking the Paris Agreement. The change in our paradigm - what is that change, Mr. Speaker, Sir? The way we live is changing. That is what we call the ‘new norm’. He talked about the changing rainfall pattern, the intensity and the frequency – that is the new norm, and we are the ones that suffer most. We are amongst the most vulnerable because the way we live is changing. The way we do development must also change. Let us not do development just for the sake of doing development and I will continue to urge the honourable Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, when it comes to investing in DRR, the biggest problem that we used to face in the machinery of Government is we do not see money put into DRR as investment. We always see it as expenditure, so that change the way we do development. The honourable Minister correctly stated about the need for us to shift to sustainability and resilience. We have always talked about the debt. This is linked to the debt that we had accumulated because every one dollar is going on $15 but usually the figure is around $7 saving for the country. That is good for us in the long term – for sustainability and for resilience as well because we need to prepare better come the next one. If electric cables needs to go underground like we did in Nadi, it has to go underground because of the tourism industry and how it also contributes. This is the change, the paradigm that we initiated, and I am thankful that it is continuing.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2030</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the way we live is changing, the way we do development has changed, the partnership is important. Sustainable Development Goal 17 is about partnership and, again, the honourable Minister has talked about that partnership as so critical. Within the country and, of course, regionally and the multi-lateral organisations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are well aware of the issue about forced migration and displacement and, unfortunately, the trend right now, there is no appetite multi-laterally on changing the 1951 UN Convention of Refugees and they are coming back to the regions now to look at ways. This is why partnerships are so important. We have done so much. Because of my time, Sir, just a few things that I have picked up from the honourable Minister’s speech that they probably need to look at. He had talked about the 1998 Act – that Act has been under review now for the last four years. When we went to Tonga, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tonga has come up with a new Act and I congratulated the Tongan team. I told the Director NDMO, I do not know what is still happening with the Act in Fiji because that Act has been under review now for the last four years. I hope that, that can be fast-tracked, honourable Minister. Our state of preparedness, I asked the honourable Minister about the state of our fleet because Fiji, given our layout, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are always worried about the islands. The state of the jetties or otherwise, the state of the airfields and Australia has already done some work on the state of our airfields because air, land and sea passages is something that the Government should always be critically aware of when it comes to response. Together with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is prepositioning. We have got the strategic reserve in Black Rock. We have got the warehouses in the North and in the Central Division, and hopefully we can also push forward prepositioning in the outer islands, particularly where we do not have the infrastructure. It is hard to get to Ono-i-Lau when it is low tide. These are things that they need to consider in terms of our state of preparedness. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the multi-hazard early warning system, that is a priority. We need to be proactive rather than reactive. I congratulate Government for the continuation of the early warning systems when it comes to flooding, but we have to do a lot as well on our coastal areas. We have installed the first 13 sirens for Suva, there is a plan to start and continue from Kiuva right through to Rakiraki, but I do not know where that is now, and we hope that we can continue with that. Lastly, again, I plead with the honourable Minister of Finance to invest in DRR. We have a DRR Policy. It is good for us in the long term because when it comes to sustainability and resilience, investment in DRR is the solution. So, I plead with the Government, please, invest in our DRR and, of course, let us look at how we can continue to support the work of NDMO. Again, the work of NDMO is critical and needs the support of every stakeholder, so be assured honourable Minister and Government that we will always be available to support our Government in its DRR and DRM efforts. Congratulations as well for the establishment of the National Emergency Response Team (NERT). Thank you, Sir. Plans for Self-Income Generating Agro-Based Projects HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is good to start speaking agriculture for some form of peace in Parliament.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2031 (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the plans for self-income generating agro-based projects in pursuit of agricultural diversification. Just before I do so, I would like to thank all honourable Members of this august Parliament who managed to visit the National Agriculture Show and had a look at the 1.4 tonne bull. Unfortunately, I did not see my good friend, honourable Bala, because I would have introduced you to the Bull. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Next time:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.:</span> On the same token, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just received information from the Animal Health and Production Division that we have finally succeeded in freezing cattle semen in Sigatoka Research Station. I must commend the Animal Health and Production Division Officials for a job well done. The process is quite hectic, and it requires the bulls be maintained on a formulated ratio to ensure their status as sexual athletes (forgive me for the language). The semen is extracted by an electric ejaculation and analysed and processed in the reproductive laboratory, and then loaded into straws and frozen. The semen is then stored in liquid nitrogen tanks ready for future use in artificial insemination. Not only does this allow for dissemination of genetics across Fiji, it also preserves the bull genetics that we currently have, and it is anticipated that at the current capacity of Sigatoka Research Breeding Centre, we will be able to produce in excess of 1,000 straws per week. That is quite a lot of semen, enough to sustain the cattle industry in Fiji. For your information, we will be receiving the liquid nitrogen generator, which is currently on order, and it is expected to arrive next month, and we will be expected to produce around 20 litres of liquid nitrogen per day. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen seated in the gallery and those who are listening via live telecast of this sitting; I stand before this august Parliament today to outline a vision for the future of agriculture in Fiji - a vision that goes beyond traditional market practices and embraces a future for self-income generating agro-based projects or value added agriculture. Our nation has long been blessed with fertile lands and a rich agricultural heritage, and it is time to adopt innovations that not only enhance productivity, but also create new opportunities for our farmers that contribute to greater economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need to shift from our over-dependence on fresh produce exports to value adding and agro-processing. This shift has already started and augurs well for the sector given the vast distance to these new markets with the obvious advantage in extended shelf life of processed products. There is also the advantage of reduced volume and increased value of exports. Australia and New Zealand are considered to be Fiji’s largest export market for fresh agricultural products, but Fiji has the potential to expand its export base through increased efforts on agro- processed products, targeting the huge markets like China and the USA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture production plays an important role in setting up small scale agro- processes while at the same time, channelling any surplus raw materials to large agro-processes. The value-added agriculture imports on average is around 53.6 percent of the total agricultural imports over the last five years. Fiji also imports an average of $121 million worth of wheat for production</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2032</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 of flour and other by-products. This data indicates the importance of the domestic demand for value added products and flour in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, potential commodities for value added processing to name a few, include: • Staples like cassava, plantain, sweet potato (gluten free flour, chips, starch and animal feed); • Coconut flour, desiccated coconut, virgin coconut oil; • Lemon grass, moringa powder; • Ginger (candy, powder, paste or juice); • Turmeric powder; • Pulses to substitute the amount of dhal consumption; • Tomato (tomato juice, puree and canning of peeled tomatoes); • Pineapple (juice, candy and fruit canning); • Duruka; • Mango and other local fruits for jam, pickles and juice. Various methods of preserving fruits and vegetables can be explored such as canning, refrigeration, drying, pickling, sugar preservation and others. There is a lot of traditional knowledge that could be expanded with modern technology. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my recent visit to India was an eye opener to the opportunities that small scale food processing can bring to the economy. Fiji needs to mobilise resources that are needed to exploit opportunities in the agro-processing space. Over the years agricultural production in India has consistently recorded higher output and according to World Agriculture 2019 India has been ranked first in pulses and milk production; second in vegetable, fruit, wheat and rice production and third in cereals and egg production. Their food processing sector grew at an average annual growth rate of 8.4 percent between 2016 to 2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of this august Parliament I had the opportunity to meet with the Minister for Food Processing Industries of India and key amongst matters discussed was the possibility of bringing to Fiji those small scale food processing equipment and machineries. These will be made available to those individuals and communities willing to venture into food processing enterprises. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year the Ministry was allocated a sum of $150,000 which assisted 11 exporters/agro-processors from the four Divisions on a cost sharing basis for infrastructure development, provision of equipment, machinery and I must say that more funds is needed for this activity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues to embark on modernising Fiji’s agriculture sector through agriculture entrepreneur’s mechanisation and agro-processing through value addition. This financial year the Commercial Agriculture Development Programme (CADP) received $1.177 million to establish and upgrade agro-processing facilities to facilitate the transformation of raw agriculture products into high value processed goods. This will not only address current issues with the market access of commodities like ginger, turmeric, cassava and pineapple but also achieve sustainable economic growth through consistency in supply, increased export competitiveness, value addition and diversification. The programme includes: 1. Manufacturing machines for value adding cassava, pineapple, ginger; 2. Procurement of cooler and freezer storage facilities;</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2033 3. 4. 5. Procurement of trucks, cooler and freezer trucks for transportation of harvested produce; Infrastructure development such as establishment or improvement of packhouse and processing or exporting facilities; Procurement of equipment for diversification purposes, such as cassava flour machines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the existing capital programmes including crop, livestock and research, the Ministry is seeking to fund and scale-up the following areas for diversification: 1. 2. Promotion of high value crops: The Ministry will identify and promote the cultivation of high-value crops with high market demands such as organic fruits and exotic vegetables. Creating such market linkages for these crops will ensure steady income for farmers. Investment in Post-Harvest Research and Infrastructure: The Ministry will upgrade and expand post-harvest infrastructure including storage facilities and farm access roads to minimise post-harvest losses and ensure the quality of agricultural products. 3. Capacity Building and Training: The Ministry will provide training programs and initiatives for farmers, individuals and communities on value addition techniques, quality control, and market trends. The Ministry will further collaborate with academia and research organisations to develop expertise in value-added agriculture. 4. Technology adoption: The Ministry will encourage the adoption of modern technologies in agriculture such as precision farming, smart irrigation systems and advanced processing equipment. The Ministry will facilitate the integration of information and communication technologies to improve farm management and market access. 5. Certification and standards: The Ministry will work with relevant government agencies to establish and enforce quality standards and certifications for value-added agriculture products to enhance consumer confidence and facilitate exports. 6. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): The Ministry will encourage partnerships between the public and private sectors to leverage investments and expertise in value-added agriculture. The Ministry through these partnerships especially private sector involvement will create a conducive environment for agri-business to thrive through policy support and incentives. 7. Market Diversification: The Ministry intends to reduce dependence by exploring and diversifying export markets for value-added agriculture products. The Ministry in collaboration with other key stakeholders will develop marketing strategies to promote Fijian agricultural products internationally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plans for value-added agriculture in Fiji are ambitious but necessary for the sustainable growth of the agriculture sector. As we embark on this journey, let us remember that the success of these plans depends on the collective efforts of farmers, policymakers and all stakeholders in the agricultural value chain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this sector is capable of addressing critical issues of food and nutrition security, food inflation and alleviating poverty. I call upon each one of you to join hands in realising this vision, for in doing so, we not only secure a prosperous future for our farmers and agro- processors but also contribute to the overall development and prosperity of our beloved nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for providing me the opportunity to deliver this Statement.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2034</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister for Agriculture. Those are very interesting topics of the bull and what you are able to get out from the bull, especially with your Assistant Minister there. (Laughter) I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to deliver their response. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, HON. S. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to reply to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Agriculture. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his insights on the agriculture sector and I always said it and I must reiterate again that irrespective of how many industries we have in the country, irrespective of how many factories we have in the country, Fiji is still an agro-based industry and each and every Member, each and every individual to support the industry. I must congratulate the Agriculture team for successfully freezing the AI straws. It is a good start but what I was trying to hear from the Minister was, what is happening to the dairy industry? Are we also concentrating on the dairy industry? That is the industry that needs a lot of support and unfortunately not a word has been said about the dairy industry. The animals are decreasing due to disease and the production is decreasing. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. NAND.- Now, the meat industry is good but the dairy industry should also be concentrated on value adding which the Minister has talked about is good for the country and good for export but this trust has been ongoing for ages. Last year at Koronivia Research Station there was a trial display, and we all went there to taste how the cassava flour tasted and everything else. So this has all been done. Why are we trying to reinvent the wheel again, why are we not moving forward? Timely introduction of technology: The extension services need to go out to the farmers and improve production, introduce technology, train farmers. It is no good sitting in the office or in the research station doing trials when the knowledge is not being transferred to the people that really needs to produce. What are we doing to control the cost of production in the agriculture sector? Day in and day out the cost of production on farms is increasing. The fertiliser cost is increasing, the sea cost is increasing, the labour cost is increasing, what support are we going to give to our agriculture sector to enable farmers to produce? It is good to say we will value add but value add what? We need production on the ground for the produce to come up and then we value add. (Hon. Prof. B. C. Prasad interjects) HON. S. NAND.- It is a very minute amount which the honourable Minister of Finance is talking about. You go to the farm and see how much assistance they are getting - it is negligible. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. NAND.- I would highly recommend our Minister of Finance to get off from his four wheel drive, get out of his overseas trips and go to the farm and talk to the farmers.

NAND.- Minister for Finance, are you done with your childish statement so I can continue? If you need time to do some more, I will give you time then I will continue. Grow up, please! What are we doing about our supply chain management? There is a huge disparity in the income of farmers in Bua, Nabouwalu Vanua Levu and farmers here. They do not have access to markets because of the supply chain. They cannot take their produce from their farm to the market in a quality that is palatable to the buyers. We need investment in the supply chain. These things are not being done - market accessibility and supply chain management. These are investments that the Ministry need to do, getting the farmers to increase production, train them, assist them, our farmers need support. You may see a doctor once in two months, you may see a lawyer once in six months, but you see a farmer everyday and every time you put something in your mouth, that is the produce from a farmer. So, we must appreciate their hard work and assist them in improving production and getting their produce to the market so that they can sell, survive and our consumers can get good quality products. We do not need to import all the produce that are being imported. Most of it can be grown locally and supplied in better quality. So, if we can give them an opportunity to produce in an environment where they can bring it to the markets, we are helping our farmers and our country.</p></body>
