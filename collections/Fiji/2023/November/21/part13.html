Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee on Social Affairs of the last term of Parliament was referred the Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report. In this new term of Parliament, the Annual Report was reintroduced and referred to the current Standing Committee. As per the normal process for report scrutiny, the Committee was mandated by Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings. Mr. Speaker, for the year 2018-2019, achievements that were highlighted by the Ministry were the: 1. Commissioning of the Nakasi Fire Station in the year 2018-2019 financial year which actually completed works in June 2020. 2. Redevelopment of Govind Park Phase 1 which was completed in the 2020-2021 financial year. 3. Reopening of the Suva Civic Centre which reopened after 18 months of redevelopment and that was under a partnership with the Guandong Nanyue Group in China and basically completed around September 2018. 4. Completion of mini markets around August and November 2018. These were the mini markets in Tavakubu in Lautoka and Cuvu in Sigatoka. 5. Completion and commissioning of the Rakiraki Fire Station in September 2019. 6. Reappointment of a special team of Special Administrators for all Municipal Councils. Mr. Speaker, the Committee commends the achievement of the Ministry for the fiscal year under review and pleads with the Ministry to continue its main objective in providing essential services and amenities and facilitate development at the local level. Mr. Speaker, to understand these essential services, the Committee undertook a site visit to some of the capital project sites that were implemented in the 2018-2019 fiscal year and commends the Ministry for its assistance in this review process. Though the annual review was for 2018-2019, the Committee acknowledged the current data and information provided by the stakeholders. This, however, greatly assisted the Committee in its review. Mr. Speaker, the Committee acknowledges the Permanent Secretary for Local Government, Ms. Seema Sharma, and her staff, for their assistance rendered in the Committeeâ€™s inquiry, as well as the bipartisan shown by honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for without their support and valuable input, this Report would not have been a successful one.

My deepest appreciation to honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Penioni Ravunawa for alternating on certain occasions.
