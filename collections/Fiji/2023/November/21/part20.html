<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –PACIFIC FISHING COMPANY LIMITED 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – PACIFIC FISHING COMPANY LIMITED 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Pacific Fishing Company Limited 2018–2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 4 th April, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Pacific Fishing Company Limited (PAFCO) is one of the largest fish processing companies in the Pacific region. It is the largest employer in Levuka and immensely contributes to the economic activity of the Island. The Committee, as part of its deliberations, had visited the PAFCO site earlier this year to fully understand the operations of the company. The years 2018-2019 Annual Reports were filled with its unique opportunities and challenges for the company. In 2018, PAFCO achieved a milestone when the former Prime Minister visited the factory to officially open the new cold storage facility. During the year, PAFCO continued its efforts to upgrade its infrastructure, plant and equipment. However, the company faced significant challenges during 2018-2019 due to inconsistent supply of albacore tuna. This led to the factory aligning its processing operations throughout to adjust to the incoming fish stock. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while deliberating on the Report, the Committee noted that the causes of the $3.2 million loss in 2019 was due to the low supply of tuna. Apart from the 20,000 metric tonnes of albacore supplied by Bumble Bee, the Committee recommended for PAFCO to explore engaging other suppliers under strict contractual terms to ensure consistency and supply of tuna and to ultimately optimise the plant’s productive capacity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also noted the need for the company to have a comprehensively documented Risk Management Policy for high risk areas that are not covered, given the two years of consecutive losses from 2018 to 2019. The Committee recommended an overall organisational review be conducted to assess both, the short term and long-term strategic issues, and determine future directions. The Committee agreed that PAFCO must continue their initiative of finding the right people to undertake the various roles available in the company. We were made aware of their cadets in the Quality Control and Production Department and an accountant was being recruited. We were also made aware of their successful Apprentice Programme through which five apprentices successfully completed their four-year programme and one was the runner up in the Apprentice of the Year Award given by the Fiji National University. Sir, PAFCO must continue its efforts to upgrade the skills of its workers. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor, perhaps, may I remind you, honourable Members, once more that the Business Committee has decided that there are, at least, two speakers from each side of Parliament before the right of reply is provided by the mover of the motion. The two speakers from each side will be given five minutes each. I have been given a list from the honourable Whips and is as follows:</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – PAFCO 2018-2019 Annual Reports 2063 1. Honourable S. T. Koroilavesau; 2. honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; and 3. honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications.. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the motion before the floor on the Consolidated Review Report of the Pacific Fishing Company Limited (PAFCO) for 2018 to 2019. I would like to thank the Chairman and the Management Board of PAFCO for the period under review. I must thank the late Mr. Iqbal Jannif for his commitment and dedication during those difficult years, as the company continued to face significant challenges in the supply of albacore. The company is the mainstay of the economy in the Lomaiviti Group and the largest employer in Ovalau with the workforce of over 870 people, comprising of senior management, production line supervisors, team leaders and skilled and general workers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are, at least, 100 people indirectly employed as contractors to transport and other business, as well as on a call basis with the major shipment of tuna that arrives at PAFCO in Levuka. Overall, the positive financial impact is spread across the entire populous of the Lomaiviti Group. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PAFCO has helped to diversify the source of income and employment in the seven islands of Lomaiviti. In 2018, as had been alluded by the Chairperson, PAFCO opened a new storage facility to store raw tuna for processing. This led to the factory aligning its processing operations throughout the adjustment to incoming fish stock. We deliberated on the $3.2 million loss in 2019 because of the lack of albacore. Ultimately, there has to be an avenue sought, now that the company is under FCF Company Limited of Taiwan. There could be an avenue to open a joint venture and I would encourage the honourable Minister for Fisheries to relook at that as I have opened the discussions with few companies that are involved in fishing in Kiribati, that could have a mother ship that actually collects fish, especially albacore, from Kiribati as a friendly neighbour that can provide a concession on the fishing licences. If this is done and the mother ship collects raw tuna from Kiribati and directly bring it to Levuka, it will help PAFCO during times when albacore is greatly demanded in the open market. The FCF is the second largest buyer and supplier of tuna in the world. That has provided a base where the honourable Minister can actually discuss. I have had discussions with the Shanghai Deep Sea Fishing in China and they have agreed for a joint venture but, ultimately, the process of negotiation was not completed. They will provide purse seiner vessels with the mother ship that will collect it and deliver it to PAFCO in Levuka. If that is done, it will greatly help PAFCO to survive in these challenging times and more so, provide employment opportunities for the whole the Lomaiviti Group. If PAFCO dies, Levuka dies and Lomaiviti will really get the repercussions of the non-existence of any economic activity in Ovalau and the whole of the Lomaiviti Province. Thank you for the opportunity Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for their Report. They would have had a very good look at the Annual Report from PAFCO to come up with the report that they have presented to us. I agree with the comment made by the former Minister, honourable Koroilavesau, and we note the difficulties that PAFCO had gone through because of the shortage of supplies of tuna, as</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>2064 Consolidated Review Report – PAFCO 2018-2019 Annual Reports 21 st Nov., 2023 well as the dilapidated condition of the various machinery and infrastructure supporting the industry in Levuka. I would like to go straight into the recommendations. It is a public enterprise under the Prime Minister’s portfolio so we have taken note of the recommendations. Earlier on this year, I received a dividend of $268,000 from PAFCO that has gone into Government. The PAFCO and Bumble Bee have had lengthy discussions about the tuna supply shortage, the subject of Recommendation No. 1. Furthermore, PAFCO is currently exploring new revenue- generating alternatives, in order to strengthen its financial performance and position. Earlier on, we had a bit of a tussle on the use of the wharf but that was amicably resolved when a shipping company tried to unload stores for the agriculture and photovoltaic projects on Ovalau. However, it leaves open the question on maritime transport infrastructure for Lomaiviti, particularly Levuka. The influence of climate change will continue to have a significant impact on tuna supplies. We have had La Nina, I do not know whether El Nino will balance it, but we live and learn. In the meantime, PAFCO will have to be looking at risk management. Recommendation No. 3 - The lease commitments were derived from both land and buildings. The 2019 audited accounts show the liability to be realised in the future and also the offsetting of right of use assets to be utilised in the future. The Suva Office exists for several reasons. Firstly, the annual sales of fish meal and packs of canned tuna are done from the office which is the dispatch office for all sales to Punjas and export of fish meal. Majority of the Board Members are based in Viti Levu and often travel to Levuka for meetings. Thus, the Office provides the opportunity for meetings to be held in Suva and it saves cost. It eases the movement of PAFCO sales stock, as it is more accurately controlled from the Suva Office. Recommendation No. 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial year 2020 and 2022 have been profitable and the average of return on equity is 10 percent for the three years. In addition, PAFCO has reviewed its Organisational Structure to ensure that the company has the right people in the right position, to implement the company’s strategies and achieve its vision. The Government is also appreciative of the late Iqbal Jannif’s performance in the control of PAFCO and its Board. Recommendation No. 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note the recommendation from the Committee and Government will continue to support the apprenticeship programme, as well as the graduate cadet training programme. Recommendation No. 6, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have been the liaising between the relevant Ministries and other relevant agencies to assist the company in resolving the issues that they have raised in their report. Those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are my comments on the Report and I, once again, commend the Committee for their Report and also the Company for its performance.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – PAFCO 2018-2019 Annual Reports 2065 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the Pacific Fishing Company Pte Limited 2018-2019 Annual Reports and I would like to thank the Standing Committee for their review and assessment of the Annual Reports. Let me join the sentiments raised by honourable Koroilavesau and my neighbour in Lami, the late Mr Iqbal Jannif, a well-known personality in our country, who served well on the Board of Pacific Fishing Company (PAFCO) for so many years and would like to just pay tribute to him in terms of the Report. As we all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, PAFCO has been around for some time. Actually even at one point in my life, I went and did audits on PAFCO, and that is how long PAFCO has been - 55 years actually to be exact. It has played a significant role in, not only in the economy of the country, but certainly in the economy of Lomaiviti and Levuka, as also mentioned by honourable Koroilavesau and the honourable Prime Minister. Basically, PAFCO is the anchor for Levuka, Mr. Speaker, Sir, or the economic epic centre for Levuka and that being the case, this side of Parliament certainly are committed to continuing the investment of PAFCO. I thought I would just change the angle a little bit, Sir, and talk about some of the things, from trade perspective, that we are thinking about PAFCO for. Before I do that, Mr. Speaker Sir, I need to raise something in Parliament that probably not all of us are aware of. Some years ago, the other side actually introduced a fishing levy - $450 metric tonnes, which basically meant that all supply of fish into Fiji became uneconomical. So, when we talk about the lack of supply of fish in PAFCO, that side of Parliament has a lot to do with that. They only reviewed the pricing in 2022 and I was trying to make it an issue during the Elections as well. However, if you want to talk about self-inflicted injuries on your own goals, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just like the blunder we heard about in FRA, this is a classic blunder. Sir, $453 metric tonnes, after that you have to add on the cost from Suva to Levuka, is uneconomical. So, they are all going to Solomons and Samoa right now and as we know in business, once we turn them away it takes them about 10 years to come back.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B.
