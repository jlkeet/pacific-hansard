<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Hon. V. T. T. K Rayalu) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Response to the question by honourable S. Nand is as follows: The Ministry implemented cost sharing programmes to facilitate the transition of the sector from previous level of production to a fully fledged commercial production system by improving access to means of implementation. This evolution will boost foreign exchange earnings further, promoting the expansion of commercial agriculture in the country. For the 2022-2023 financial year, the assistance provided directly to farmers will increase food production and levels of food security thus create market opportunities and improve livelihood, respectively. The support provided was divided into two categories to facilitate equal opportunities to farmers based on their level of production and progress - for individuals who have never received Ministry of Agriculture assistance before and for those who have been assisted in the past and have progressed well. In the cost sharing arrangement, each party contributes a portion of the total cost, which includes direct costs like materials, labour, agro-inputs and indirect costs such as administration and salaries. Cost sharing is an effective way to cushion financial burdens and risks among multiple stakeholders, fostering collaboration on shared responsibility for achieving the primary goal, which is production in this context. (a) During the 2022-2023 financial year, the Ministry had 16 cost-sharing programmes and have assisted more than 989 farmers, as illustrated in the table below.
