<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Leadership Training for Multi-Ethnic Groups (Question No. 160/2023) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2036</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs offers leadership training for iTaukei leaders. The training, packaged as the Sauvaki Programme, assists them in their community leadership roles. Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament if the Ministry has any plans to provide similar leadership training for other multi- ethnic groups? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question by honourable Tuinaceva. In fact, I did talk to honourable Tuinaceva during tea break to give him the programmes and plans that we have. However, for the benefit of Parliament, I would like to talk some more on his question. As per my response in the April Sitting of Parliament, I mentioned that the work of the Ministry is in progress. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, just a point of interest, is it a military strategy that you get to the person who is going to raise a question first before the time is given for him to ask his question? (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I somehow like the honourable Member. That is why I am alright about it. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- That is good - very promising. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consultation has focussed on the key issues in the ethnic-affairs space and how they address the new Ministry. The overall tenure of the consultation has been very positive and the level of expectation from the community and the new Ministry is very noteworthy. At this juncture, I would like to mention that we have brought in two consultants from New Zealand who are former Fiji residents, but at no cost to the taxpayers of Fiji. They have volunteered to do the service free of charge, to write, a report for the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs. Together with that, I would like to send my humble appreciation to the High Commission of New Zealand, in particular, the High Commissioner. The New Zealand High Commission paid for all the expenses surrounding the consultation, air fares and accommodation throughout Fiji wherever they will go. So, at least, the work is in progress now. We expect to receive a detailed report from our advisors in the next four weeks to six weeks on the framework for the Ministry, with detailed plans on the implementation. This will begin the development and the implementation of the new Ministry’s substantive work programme. While it is premature to identify the specific priorities of the Ministry at this stage, the honourable Member can be assured that the intension is to include specific programmes that will promote social cohesion amongst all ethnic groups, including our indigenous community. It will be expected that there will be a significant co-operation between the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs where learnings from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs could be beneficial to the multi-ethnic affairs that will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that the work has commenced as planned, and we have substantial progress established by the Coalition Government. It has appointed a core of 12 support staff, and it is making a good progress on the setting up of the administrative system.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2037 With the assistance of the two advisors, over 50 consultations have been undertaken with a wide range of ethnic groups representatives and leaders, State agencies, academics, political leaders and lead institutions, including Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Turaga Na Roko Tui Bau, Marama na Roko Tui Dreketi, Tui Noco, the Ministry for Education, Ministry for Women, Children and Social Protection and the two gentlemen who have also met with the honourable Prime Minister. To other Ministries, the co-operation will help leverage the experience. Our Government works on the principles of consultation, inclusiveness and commitment. I want to assure the honourable Member that suggestions and recommendations made during the consultation will be taken into consideration, with the assurance to include leadership training. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just very quickly, the honourable Minister for Agriculture highlighted about the bull, if it is not controlled, it can become very reckless, of course, a mass destruction. Speaking of reckless, honourable Minister, I just want to quickly highlight in Parliament that he has threatened farmers - … HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Question!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> … a bulldozed threat to the farmers.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, he spoke about the framework that is being established for the Multi-Ethnic Affairs and it is almost 11 months into Government. Because you said that consultations are happening, does this framework include cultural competence to address ethnic disparities that is being faced in this country? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this honourable Member should read the entire article, if not, then just the headline. What I have said to the farmers is that the variety of cane which is not approved, that has to be removed. (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Listen! We cannot waste our time and money on the sugarcane farms that do not give the right variety of cane. That is it. (Laughter) HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a supplementary question to the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, but before I do, I would like to make comment, just like honourable Rinesh Sharma. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Question! HON. K. K. LAL.- The honourable Minister conducted a consultation where honourable Bia was also present and he gifted those who were present with PAP mugs - mugs with PAP logo. I do not know what the honourable Minister was trying to implement there. HON. C. J. SINGH.- What is your question? (Laughter)</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2038</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 HON. K. K. LAL.- But Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are about to end the year and the Coalition Government is about to finish its first year in their term. The question to the honourable Minister is, has the Ministry conducted any surveys or consultations to gauge the interest and specific needs of leaders from different ethnic groups regarding leadership training? If so, what were the findings and how are they being incorporated into your planning? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is daydreaming. I just answered that a report is coming out, just wait for it and be patient. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> You watch out, we will make a statement.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Hold on, do not threaten the honourable Minister. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Section? HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- An honourable Member should not be issuing threatening language. He pointed at the honourable Member and said, “You watch out”. It is, sort of, a physical threat, he should withdraw that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Lorry awe:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, you have the floor, that will be the third supplementary question. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has just mentioned that they have engaged two consultants who are basically sponsored the New Zealand Government. In doing so, there must have been an MOU done, so I want to find out the amount that the New Zealand Government has given for this exercise?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I do not actually have the figure.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.:</span> Oh!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Hold on! But I think it is somewhere around $200,000.</p><p>(Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! They are former Fiji residents, honourable Bala. Status of Issuance of PSV Licence (Question No. 161/2023) HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on the status of issuance of a PSV licence?</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2039 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Before I respond, I would like to provide some background in the uplifting of the freeze on the four permit types. In 2011, the former Government had imposed a freeze on permit types with a justification that Land Transport Authority (LTA) undertake a comprehensive review on the demand and supply of PSV permits in Fiji, and to clearly assess and determine the future viability and sustainability of Fiji’s land transport industry. However, this comprehensive review did not materialise but instead, substantive changes to the law were made, in particular, relating to PSV permits and the sale of those, and also in terms of financial institutions being somehow accountable. It is now up to this Government to correct some of these. The Ministry and LTA had undertaken a nationwide consultation, seeking views of all stakeholders on PSV permits. The information obtained has been crucial, to enable the Ministry and LTA to address gaps in policies and processes and also in relooking at operations within. In October 2023, Cabinet had endorsed the uplifting of the freeze for the four types - Licence Hire (LH), Licence Rental (LR), Licence Carriers (LC) and Licence Minibus (LM). This has become a necessity, especially with the increase in activities, particularly in the tourism industry. There are currently more than 14,000 PSV permits issued - more than 7,000 issued in the Central Division; approximately 7,561 in the Western Division; and 1,038 in the Northern Division. Majority of these permits are taxis operating in Fiji with more than 4,000 in the Central Division; 2,883 in the Western Division; and 519 in the Northern Division. There are 57 bus companies currently in operation - 27 in the Central Division, 25 in the Western Division and five in the Northern Division, a total of 1,250 buses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to issuing applications for new PSV permits, the LTA first issues out a checklist to customers so that they acquire the necessary requirements for the application. This has been an ongoing process, for example, in the Central Division, the LTA has issued checklist for LM - 445, LR - 215, LH - 737 and LC 183. In the Western Division, 266 for LM, 123 for LR, 205 for LH. Out of the total of 615 in the Western Division, 43 have provided, for example, relevant documentation; 25 had been issued with applications which are currently under process and seen as complying, 18 did not meet the criteria, 11 appeared for applications and more than 500 of those who had been issued with a checklist have yet to submit. One of the things which we have noticed is the delay in the submission of applications due to the various compliance requirements, in particular, difficulty in acquiring base letters, obtaining consent letters for applicants wishing to operate from commercial properties, support letters for private bases and also for binding contracts. So far, LTA has not issued any licence given the issues, and for us, it is an indication of rigorous checks in place and assessments before licences are issued. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister; most of those who are waiting for the lifting of the freeze from those that have been wanting to get a licence on taxis and minibuses, however, that has not been included in the list of licences being lifted. Is there a reason for that, or when can they expect these licences to be opened up for them? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The minibuses are included but the taxis, the freeze is still to be lifted and that is currently being assessed. One of the issues is further consultations regarding the operations from the base and the open taxi rank system. The other one which we are currently looking at, which we will be presenting to Cabinet, is the review of the sale of permits. That is another contentious issue which is also urgent, and we should resolve it by the end of the year.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2040</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, special cases, special needs because we need to serve the people as well because when you do not fix the roads, taxis cannot go. This is a major problem in Seaqaqa. They prefer not to use cars, they prefer to use four-wheel drives. Where do they fit into this plan that you have? HON. V. PILLAY.- Do something honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- New question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> It is hard to fix 16 years of neglect.</p><p>(Laughter) It is very hard to fix it in 12 months. In the Northern Division, they are approached individually, including Seaqaqa. Definitely, on the village-based ones in terms of carrier, we have received applications for those and also looking at it in terms of the criteria. But there is also a concern by bus companies that whatever LTA approves should not result in undermining the operations of the buses. It has to be very balanced, and we need to proceed carefully so other PSV licences are running and we do not destroy the bus industry, as we have managed to do since, I suppose, before Independence. HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to ask a supplementary question. The last time I was in Seaqaqa was last year, the road was fixed. So, obviously, if that road is deteriorated, then it became deteriorated this year, just like we have the potholes at Nakasi. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Coming:</span></p><p>In relation to the Public Service Vehicles (PSVs), my concern, honourable Minister, is in relation to the people who drive these vehicles. This past month, I have had to tell-off bus drivers and taxi drivers about calling on the phone, loud music - personally doing that. I am just wondering, when you give these PSVs, is there a stronger process to get these PSV operating drivers to really serve the people rather than do this loud music, answering the phones and all that? It is a big concern. I hope you can come up with a solution to that. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I just give some examples of numbers in Divisions who have taken the checklist and they have tried to adhere to the checklist and after that, they are assessed. So, upto now, LTA has not issued a licence. That shows that a more vigorous assessment is being done before we issue that. In that assessment, we are envisaging that such persons will not come through - those whom you have mentioned who are not operating according to ethical standards in terms of operating a public service vehicle. Unfortunately, every supplementary question starts with the roads. This is about LTA, so let me remind honourable Members.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Those two connect and you should know better:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- A major reform was done in terms of roads management by the FijiFirst Government when they were on this side:</span></p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2041 HON. K. K. LAL.- What will PWD do? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- So, in that reform, they managed to get rid of the major entity which was dealing with the rural roads and now they are criticising, which is the Public Works Department. Before there were depots in Seaqaqa, but who closed it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- The road was alright last year:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That is something we are trying to fix. It needs multi-million- dollar support to bring back those depots and re-equip them:</span> It will take perhaps, one budget cycle and another budget cycle because it cannot be done immediately. I mean, not only did you muck up PWD, you also mucked up the budget with your huge debt and that is why he cannot give me the money. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now move on. The third Oral Question for today is now redundant, since the honourable Prime Minister has made a Ministerial Statement to that effect. (Question No. 162/2023 was withdrawn) Before I adjourn Parliament for lunch, I would like to acknowledge the presence of Reverend Kania and his colleagues sitting in the gallery, not forgetting Pundit Swami Maharaj. It has been a while since we have seen you again. On that note, honourable Members, I would like to adjourn Parliament for lunch, and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.29 p.m.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2042</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 2.28 p.m. 2023-2026 Strategic Action Plan Framework – Agriculture &amp; Fisheries Co-operation (Question No. 163/2023) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry update Parliament on the 2023–2026 Strategic Action Plan Framework on Agriculture and Fisheries Cooperation between the Government of the Republic of China and Pacific Island Countries? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question. Before I move onto my response, I wish all honourable Members of this august Parliament, all fisherfolks nationwide, all industry stakeholders, partners in development and members of the public at large, a Happy World Fisheries Day. Mr. Speaker, Sir, China continues to be an important development partner for Fiji and the Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Since the establishment of our diplomatic relations in 1975, the friendship and bilateral relations between Fiji and China have grown significantly across all fields of co-operation, but more so notably in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. It is, therefore, important that Fiji continues its pathway to strengthening its partnership and forge new pathways to developing and sustaining these sectors into the future. From the onset, the 2023-2026 Strategic Action Plan Framework on Agriculture and Fisheries Cooperation, is one of the outcomes of the second China-Pacific Island Countries Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers Meeting hosted in Nanjing, China, May 2023. This second China-PICs Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers Meeting attended by Fiji and nine other PICs resulted in China presenting two outcome documents – the Nanjing Consensus and the 2023-2026 Strategic Actions on Agriculture and Fisheries Co-operation between China and PICs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023-2026 Strategic Action Plan, aims to identify the direction and priorities for our agriculture and fisheries cooperation over the four years, leverages our complementary strengths and promotes our shared growth in agriculture and fisheries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, key strategic actions identified under this Plan are as follows: • • • • China will formulate regional or bilateral agricultural and fisheries cooperation plans with PICs in accordance with their will and aspirations to facilitate, coordinate and guide the collaboration between businesses and research institutes of the participants and follow-ups. China will organise agricultural and fisheries technology training sessions for PICs and invite agricultural professionals from the Pacific to China for exchanges on agricultural and fisheries technology or graduate programmes in universities or research institutions. Parties will strengthen South-South co-operation under the Framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Technical assistance and training will be provided to PICs through, inter alia, expert fielding, training courses and demonstration activities. In accordance with the agreements entered with the recipient countries, China will continue to support the agriculture and fisheries development in the PICs by strengthening</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2043 collaboration in juncao production, animal farming, agricultural and fisheries product processing, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet has endorsed Fiji’s participation to the Strategic Framework Action Plan through the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, in the second Ministers Meeting headed by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, Fiji and China urgently resounded the importance of strengthening cooperation in sustainable agriculture and fisheries as a critical way forward for us small island countries to help elevate living standards of our people. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his explanation on the assistance by China. What I would like to ask the honourable Minister, if he has done a comparison on the assistance provided by our friends from other countries, compared to the assistance provided by China in the last eight years? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. I think it is a new question and I will work on it and I will come back on another day of the sitting. MR. SPEAKER.- No, I will decide on that, honourable Minister. Will you come back to honourable Koroilavesau with an answer?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The honourable Minister for Agriculture, this morning, talked about the downstreaming process and the need to shift away from commodities into products because that will bring a lot of economic benefits. How is the Ministry of Fisheries approaching this as well based on this agreement that they have signed with China? Mr. Speaker, this is an area that probably needs to be looked at seriously too by the Ministry of Fisheries as it has a lot of wild harvesting going on and we need to go into technology. Where is the Ministry of Fisheries heading in this regard? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is also a new question, but I will try to elaborate. MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, it relates to the earlier question. Do you have an answer, or you do not have it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> I will answer, later.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Fiji and China… MR. SPEAKER.- What is Fiji-China? Honourable Minister, where are you taking us?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> To China, Sir.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2044</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 MR. SPEAKER.- You still have the floor. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. As I have alluded in my speech, Fiji and China have diplomatic relations since 1975 and they are coming up with questions. I think Fiji is taking it lightly to partner with China. They are looking at China as a karate kid. (Laughter) HON. K. V. RAVU.- Yes, they are scared of coming closer to China so when the Coalition Government… MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I am very confused as to where you are taking us. Do you have any other supplementary question honourable Members?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> It is alright, honourable Minister, we will take another question. HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you for the opportunity to ask a supplementary question. China has been a friend of Fiji for a long time. They stood by our side in difficult times and has continued to do so as part of our foreign affairs policy of friends of all and enemies of none. It is good to see this particular question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier on this year when we were looking at the fishing industry in Fiji, we noticed that a lot of our offshore fisheries boats are not moving. If you go now, they are parked in the harbour. One of the difficulties that they have, a lot of the companies that they compete against are subsidised by their home countries. Would that be something that you will also address in this strategic cooperation with China because our boats are being parked, they are finding it uncompetitive to compete and because of that, people that are employed in our local industry are not earning income for their families. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question. I will come back with a response on that at a later date. I can refer to Foreign Affairs. Market Employability Survey (Question No. 164/2023) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament if Market Employability Survey is conducted before Government grant is allocated to training institutions? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for this question because it is, no doubt, a very important question, especially when the honourable Member is a former Director of Human Resources in the Ministry of Education. He could have made some submissions to the relevant institution to adopt such tool. HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question! HON. H. CHAND.- Answer, answer!</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2045 MR. SPEAKER.- I do not know what has happened to our sitting down and discussing things because that earlier stance taken by the honourable Minister for Fisheries, I do not know what bait he haa been bringing in. It has gone on a tailspin, I think. (Laughter) HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Market Employability Surveys guide us on whether our graduates are competent to meet the job demands, they will have and also assist our nation identify the areas that may need certain kind of skills. Mr. Speaker, Sir, job markets in the rapid developing world pursue employees with the right kind of knowledge, skills and capacities. For a developing country like Fiji, a Market Employability Survey is crucial, to ensure that we are generating a workforce that not only meets the demand of our various job sectors, but it complements any new markets that are presenting itself in our fast-evolving global economy. The preparation for our young generation for the labour market, as we know, is a critical responsibility for universities and accordingly, the curricula of universities should continuously reflect and improve the quality of their graduates to fit into dynamic and diverse job markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the prerequisites for the Higher Education Commission Fiji (HECF) on the university grants allocation, they are regulated and disbursed through the Higher Education Commission Act 2008 and the Higher Education Commission Regulations 2009. In there, it specifically provides the requirements that the Commission must consider when determining the allocation of grants to institutions. The primary requirement for accessing these grants, Sir, is that they should be registered with the HECF. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the current Coalition Government, we have made it mandatory for the three Universities to submit Graduate Destination Surveys with grant application. This requirement came into effect on the 2023-2024 National Budget. However, due to data unavailability, the Universities could not fulfil this requirement for the 2023-2024 grant allocation. They are currently working on it and will be now required to submit these survey results for the 2024- 2025 grant allocation and beyond. Using the survey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the HECF will work with the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Scheme (TSLS) to ensure that scholarships and loan assistance are directed to qualifications that are in demand and reduce for the qualifications where students are unemployed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TVET qualifications are essential and special funding was allocated in the 2023-2024 National Budget. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have requested the HECF to analyse the audited financial statements of the Universities as part of their grant allocation. The idea is to ascertain the Universities’ financial sustainability and understand their funding requirements. I am talking about the detailed analysis of the audited financial reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government funds for the three Universities’ operation and capital budgets, while they also charge student fees, it is natural to think that if Government funds universities, should they not subsidise tuition fees for the local students as a way forward? I am thinking the HECF to benchmark to the university funding system of Australia, may be, and if a similar funding system can be adopted in Fiji universities, where local student fees are subsidised by the Government funding.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2046</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform this Parliament that a detailed review of the three Universities will be carried out in 2024, as I will be alluding to it in my Ministerial Statement tomorrow. Amongst other things, we will consider the quality and relevance of tertiary qualifications and financial sustainability of the three Universities. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament if there was a Market Employability Survey conducted before the Government grant was allocated to Pacific Polytech? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have alluded to that supplementary question earlier on, that there was none done because of unavailability of data. HON. P. K. BALA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am a bit worried. If the survey was not done for Pacific Polytech, how come before Budget, $1 million was allocated?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There was no survey done:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> See, again, he is interrupting.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He told you very clearly:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> He has to tell me, not you.</p><p>And then in the budget, $1.6 million was given. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have to re-state my answer again, that there was no survey done, as in the previous years. So, this is what we are trying to improve on, going forward. MR. SPEAKER.- We will leave it at that. Total Road Upgrading Cost - Queen Elizabeth Drive to National Stadium (Question No. 165/2023) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the total cost of upgrading the road from Queen Elizabeth Drive in Nasese to the National Stadium? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Queen Elizabeth Drive upgrade project between Ratu Sukuna Road to Laucala Bay Intersection comprise a total distance of 4.23 kilometres. It has the following features: • • • dedicated online bicycle lane for 8.5 kilometres in both 4.25 kilometres in each direction; two roundabouts at Vuya Road and Muanikau Road signalised pedestrian crossing; improved parking facilities; bus shelters, bus bays and recreational areas. The above project is currently nearing completion, and it is targeted to be completed around 31 st December.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2047 It started in March 2019. The original contract price was $61.9 million on 14 th August, 2020 when there was variation in design change - redesigned for the purpose of shifting alignments towards the sea to avoid land acquisition. This also included delayed damages to contractors as this was a design and build contract. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 12 th January, 2021, another variation of $3.3 million to meet climate resilience, lifting of whole pavement works and services relocation of WAF, EFL and TFL. So, the total variation was $3.7 million and payment to-date was $49.7 million. The estimated cost of completion is $65.7 million, so those are the costings. I suppose the Opposition will claim or say that “Yes, this is the FijiFirst project”. I am sure it was started under the previous Government but some of the fundamental questions we need to ask regarding projects such as this is, what should we be prioritising, given the extremely high cost because if you look at it with that estimated total cost at the completion of the project of $65.7 million, that will work out with 4.23 kilometres - $15.5 million per kilometre? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Wastage. Investigate it! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- This is what this Coalition Government is relooking at whether we will be repeating such projects which are too costly and reassign hard-earned funds of the country. There are other priorities, for example, double lanes from Laqere to Kinoya and Fletcher Road. That was in the original plans in terms of traffic alleviation - Fletcher Road and MGM to Laucala Bay. So, we could have looked at double lanes there. The upgrades of rural roads and bridges and community roads - these have been neglected for too long and this is an area which we need to prioritise into. (Hon. P. K. Bala interjects) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen, Listen! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, to conclude, just looking at the cost as a Coalition Government moving forward, our priorities will be different …. (Hon. K. K. Lal interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.-… rather than looking at too shorter distance and a huge amount. Also, if you look at the amount of traffic there, I think it finishes about 5.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. compared to improving the Laqere to Suva Point …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- You change it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> … to four lanes and other priorities, including some of our rural roads which definitely need improvement and which we are looking into where school children cannot even reach school …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

PRASAD.:</span> You have wasted $65.7 million.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are arguing about whether it is a waste or not, from our perspective as a Coalition, it is excessive and a waste and wrongly prioritised. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can the honourable Minister inform us as to what was supposed to be the real cost for the road? HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. If we look back into the history of the road, it sort of coincided with the approval of the development lease for Tian Lun Investments Pte Limited in 2018 where a development lease was issued in September 2018 and this project started in 2019. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- So regarding that development which is linked to the road, the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources has taken action on Tian Lun Investments that failed to obtain a subdivisional approval or scheme plan. They failed to submit approved engineering plan and all sorts of non-compliance, Sir, which resulted in the cancellation of their lease on that road. So, the question is, who approved the lease to Tian Lun Investments? (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- When we look back, this is the kind of thing this country should be avoiding - building the road for a particular investor and we ended up wasting $65 million. Going back to answering that question, I asked some of the experienced engineers, can you develop Queen Elizabeth Drive from what it was before to an acceptable state? They said, “Yes, $15 million…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. BIA.- You are on record:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> … as opposed to $65 million.” So, $65 million minus $15 million, if you ask a secondary school student, $50 million extra was used where we should have just used $15 million. Just imagine where we could have used that $50 million on rural roads, community</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2049 roads and even in informal settlements. We could have improved everything, but we are working on that. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Albert Park and look at how Albert Park is currently utilised. There was a recent article in one of the dailies, Sir, about the value of the estates (got a valuer) from within this corridor. You are looking at the cost, but you are not looking at the benefits out of the investment. We talked about resilience infrastructure this morning, that is resilience infrastructure. It is going to raise big time the value of the properties there, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I know for a fact that the former Leader of the Government in Parliament has a three-storey building just at the end, that is investment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is good. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, despite the high cost, what major projects are you going to tell the people of Fiji and, particularly, Suva, you have in place in the next four years while in Government? HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already explained our priorities and they are already there. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Think big, man!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The double lane is from Laqere to Suva Point:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Do not lower your standards:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Upgrade of roads and bridges, rural roads and bridges in Vanua Levu. You mentioned Seaqaqa and, of course, the sealing of non-sealed roads and new roads, of course. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all and we will give you the list of the new projects at the end of this financial year. MR. SPEAKER.- The next Question, I am allowing honourable Aliki Bia to raise this Question on behalf of honourable Bulitavu. Policy on Menstrual Health and Hygiene (Question No. 166/2023) HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament what the policy is with respect to the distribution of sanitary pads under the Menstrual Hygiene Management activity?

(Response handed to the Secretary-General) iTAUKEI AFFAIRS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the – (a) iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 26/2023), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committees of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd November, 2023, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise today to introduce and to table the iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 before this august Parliament. This is an important aspect of our history where we wish to give legislative recognition once again to the establishment of a fundamental institution, which is the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) or Bose Levu Vakaturaga (BLV). The GCC is a historical institution of our forefathers, whose role was recognised under the 1990 and 1997 Constitutions to be consulted on, make recommendations and take decisions in 3 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 170/2023 tabled by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry 4 is appended as Annexure III. Reply to Written Question No. 171/2023 tabled by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice is appended as Annexure IV.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>2052 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 21 st Nov., 2023 matters concerning the good governance and wellbeing of the iTaukei people. This requirement to have the GCC in place is specified under the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944, which also makes reference to the GCC in various other provisions under the Act and in other legislation relating to iTaukei affairs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2012, these important key provisions were removed entirely and also extended to the regulations or subsidiary laws that were made under the Act, and I say, without consultation or consideration of our traditional leaders’ input, when it came to the iTaukei people. In fact, the deletion of provisions under the Act was done by way of a Decree, and as you all know, there was no Parliament in 2012, therefore, no opportunity was given to debate on the changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand not to marginalise anyone, but simply to highlight that it is our Coalition Government’s priority to restore the recognition of the GCC whilst under the Act to ensure that the voice and opinion of our traditional elders are considered when matters concerning iTaukei people, their traditions and culture arises. Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, the amending legislation will come into force on a date or dates appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act by inserting the definition of “Council” to mean the Great Council of Chiefs and the definition of “Permanent Secretary” to mean the Permanent Secretary responsible for iTaukei Affairs. Clause 3 of the Bill inserts section 3 of the Act to provide for the constitution and primary function of the GCC. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section4(4) of the Act to require the iTaukei Affairs Board to refer to the GCC any question relating to the iTaukei people that the Minister may submit to the Board. Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 5 of the Act to empower the Minister to make regulations in relation to the GCC. Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 11 of the Act to require the Minister to refer the Board or the Council any proposed Bill that is intended to be introduced in Parliament and which may appear to the Minister to affect in any important matter the rights and interests of iTaukei people. The Board or the Council, as the case may be, is then required to submit the proposed Bill with a memorandum to the Permanent Secretary. This memorandum contains respective comments on the proposed Bill to be used in parliamentary debate by Members of Parliament. Clause 7 of the Bill consequentially amends the iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004, among other things, to include reference to the GCC. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is this Government’s priority and promise to institute fundamental provisions and laws to give legislative recognition to the GCC. It is only imperative that Parliament deliberates on this in an expeditious manner, as there are so many laws that have been made that have direct impact on the iTaukei people. It is without doubt that this Bill must be considered so that institutions, specifically dedicated to look into matters, are afforded the legislative authority to do so. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Attorney-General for his</p><h4>presentation on this particular Bill.

But there has not been a single legislation that this Government has brought to Parliament that has not gone through Standing Order 51; not a single one. Let me say that again, not a single one. This is from people who always talked about not using Standing Order 51. This Government has not given a Bill; a single one.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D.

SPEAKER.- There being no other comments to be made on the Bill, I now offer the floor to the honourable Attorney-General for his right of reply. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- I think if honourable Usamate was listening to the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs’ comments, he would have understood the purpose as to why this is to be brought forward. As we debate on the Bill on Thursday, the reason will be fully articulated. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on the motion. Question put.
