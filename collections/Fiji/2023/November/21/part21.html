<body><h3>PAFCO.</h3><h4>PAFCO.</h4><p>Let me just keep on going from there, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The albacore that we get from our own fishing vessels, not all of it goes to PAFCO. So, the question that this side of Parliament and certainly, the Ministry of Trade is asking is, is there a way we can encourage those of our own fishing vessels? About 7,000 metric tonnes, Mr Speaker, Sir, that are caught in Fiji Waters, but it is not all going to PAFCO. It is something that we should be discussing and we will certainly be discussing and addressing in the near future. In terms of skipjack tuna, Mr. Speaker Sir, currently it is expensive to export our skipjack tuna into the European Union because there is duty imposed on it. Now, with the new Economic Co- operation Agreement that is about to be signed, we will be taking steps to try and remove the duty and ensure that we are able to export economically into the EU market which, in itself, is one of the largest markets in the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I agree with honourable Koroilavesau on the need to look at regional co-operation when it comes to fish supply. In fact, this is a conversation I have just been having on</p><p>2066 Review Reportâ€“Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 a regional level. The question that we have to ask is, why are we getting foreign vessels from outside to come and fish in our own waters? We need to change this, it is wrong. You have oil in your country. Do you get other people to come and get your oil? Your oil is your own and so as our fish stocks, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, over the next 12 months, you will see a lot more activity. Certainly, I know that PNG is interested in having that conversation and through the honourable Minister for Fisheries, we will try and actively pursue this because ultimately, what it means is more jobs to our country, more money to Levuka and also a bit more economic activity in our country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report did mention something about insurance. I am assured by the current management that they did have some issues with insurance but is now being sorted. It is to do with the cyclone insurance and that is comforting from a risk management perspective. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would also like to congratulate PAFCO for introducing capacity building into their workforce. It is the largest employer of workers in Levuka, over 780 people with salary of about $8 million. It means a lot to Levuka and the Lomaiviti Province. As I had mentioned, certainly this side of Parliament will be trying to do things to make PAFCO more profitable and more successful in years to come. Vinaka saka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee of Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments and insights into the Annual Report and the challenges and opportunities being faced by PAFCO. It is quite important that we take note of all these challenges and, of course, Government has to address some of the pertinent issues that have been highlighted by the Report and we hope that this will ensure that we have a sustainable tuna industry in this country to be managed now by PAFCO. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed and, particularly, Members of the Standing Committee. I have no other comments to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
