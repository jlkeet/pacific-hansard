TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2018-2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 14 th July, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tables its report on the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2018-2019 Annual Report earlier this year. While reviewing the Report, the Committee noted the benefits of the CEOs forum held by Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) annually and recommended for forums of such nature to be held at least on a biannual basis to further strengthen engagements with stakeholders. The Committee agreed that because of the significant role FRCS plays, it is important to maintain a strong relationship with its stakeholders. The Committee noted the 14 Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) signed during the period under review and recommended that these stakeholders work in collaboration to ensure compliance at all levels. The Committee noted with concern the significant increase in debtors due to outstanding fees and charges as well as a significant increase in outstanding inventory funds. The Committee recommended that more practical measures be pursued to alleviate these matters. The Committee also made recommendations for continuous awareness sessions to ensure that people are able to understand the compliance requirements. Services and programmes such as Stock which appear in newspaper articles and border control, TV shows are a positive form of spreading awareness and similar initiatives must be taken on. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and before offering the floor, I have a list of speakers before me from the Whips: (1) honourable Vijay Nath; (2) honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises; (3) honourable P. D. Kumar; and the (4) honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2018-2019 Annual Report. As we delve into this comprehensive report, I would like to highlight a few key points. The CEO Forum is a resounding success and has gained the Committee’s recommendation for biannual rather than the current annual. This shift will foster deeper engagement with stakeholders and strengthen relationships with relevant parties.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 2075 The signing of 14 Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) during the review period underscores the willingness of stakeholders to collaborate with FRCS for mutual benefit. This positive attitude towards compliance is commendable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government initiative like the Gold Card Services and Authorised Economic Operators Programme has been instrumental in recognising and rewarding the compliant company with priority and privileged services. This approach not only encourages tax compliance but also contributes to reducing the black economy, a significant loss in tax revenue that is crucial for our national development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Coaling Government to recognise that running of Government is not an easy task. It demands funding for various initiatives including economic stimulation, infrastructure maintenance and upgrading quality and free education for primary and secondary levels, accessibility to healthcare and dental care and many more. It is imperative to understand that the majority of the funds required for these initiatives which the Government has yet to present to Parliament will be generated through tax revenue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in year 2018-2019, FRCS collected $2.8 billion, accounting for 66.4 percent of the overall Government revenue. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2019 dealt a severe blow to FRCS revenue collection, causing the dramatic drop to $1.692 billion. In the post- COVID fiscal year (2022-2023), FRCS managed to collect $2.285 billion. While this represents a recovery, I sincerely hope that FRCS revenue collection will return to pre-COVID level in the near future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Customer Service Survey rating of 2.55 out of 5.0 raises concern about the need for improvement. This rating indicates an approval rating of only 51 percent. As the Report aptly states, FRCS has identified areas for improvement to enhance their rating. I eagerly anticipate seeing the improvement in the approval rating in recent years and the specific measures implemented to elevate service delivery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) analysis revealed and encouraging 47.95 percent female staff representation. I applaud this achievement and hope to see an even higher percentage of female staff in the years to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to concluding, I would like to address the fact that during the period covered by this Report, the Cost of Living and debt were manageable. However, this situation drastically changed with the offset of the COVID-19 pandemic which plunged our beloved nation into a state of economic hardship. While we witnessed a low inflation rate during COVID-19 crisis, we are now facing a surge in the Cost of Living and inflation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has said yesterday that ANZ should be very careful while making such wild projections because the methodology they used is based on the gross value added of the retail sector. The Minister further explained “inflation” is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based on the representative basket of goods and services purchased by the consumer with different weights. I urge the honourable Minister of Finance to consider updating the CPI basket as it relies on the outdated data of 2008. The Coalition Government must recognise that the higher cost of living, the increase in VAT and the increase in inflation is inevitable led by reducing consumer spending constantly diminishing tax revenue. In conclusion, I commend FRCS for its comprehensive report and commend the organisation for its significant contribution to the nation’s economic development. I urge the Government to heed the recommendations present in this Report and prioritise measures to enhance FRCS’s efficiency,</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>2076 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 effectiveness and consumer service to ensure that continued success of our nation’s revenue collection effect. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Review Report of the FRCS Annual Report 2018-2019 that was published this year. I would like to congratulate the Committee for their comments. Because my contribution is brief and will focus really on MSMEs, I just thought I respond to some of the outlandish statements that were made in the last question. The first thing I would like to mention or state, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this adage, “if you cannot measure, you cannot manage.” That is the summary of the government on the other side. The honourable Minister for Women and the honourable Assistant Minister were very modest. What they have been doing over the last 12 months is trying to collect data, which will enable them to start creating a pathway out of poverty for the people who are impoverished in this country. They have gone so far as to talking to the Australian Embassy to develop a database which will then allow us to say, “how many are genuinely impoverished in our country, let us create a pathway for them.” Simple! The other side, after 16 years, did not come up with something that this side of Parliament and the two learned honourable Members have come up within less than 12 months. So going forward, you will find that there will be a concise, very clear plan to move people out of poverty and it will be measured. The other side of Parliament used to come up with outlandish statements about, “we have reduced poverty by blah, blah, blah.” No statistics. Secondly, honourable Sashi talked about interagency corporation. The other side of Parliament, I think there was only one person who used to credit himself with everything. That is the secret to how we are going to get out of poverty in this country. We have to work together as a country. Every single agency in this country needs to work together to get us out of poverty. It is not their problem, it is not our problem, it is not Kamikamica’s problem, it is our total problem. As a country with data, we will be able to get out of poverty in this country. The final point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is you may recall that in our budget speech, we talked about rebuilding Fiji. In order to realise this alleviation of poverty, this side of Parliament is saying we need to rebuild Fiji, we need to rebuild the economic architecture of Fiji, which means: (1) Google is landing a second cable into Fiji. Trust me, Sir, it will transform Fiji digitally; and (2) the honourable Minister for Agriculture talked about how he wants to transform agriculture using mechanisation at farm level to try and value add. These are the types of visionary ideas that will get us out of poverty. So, when the other side of Parliament is saying, “what are we doing?” We are doing a lot more than what you ever did in 16 years. Remember that. HON. P. K. BALA.- Where is your data? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to contribute very quickly on the Report. I would like to congratulate FRCS in terms of their Report. Firstly, Mr, Speaker, Sir, over the years, being an accountant myself, I have seen a transformation in FRCS. They have moved from what used to be a very almost vindictive way of operating into a risk-based management system. So, if you are good taxpayer, you get rewarded as was alluded to by honourable Nath. That is the way of the future, that is the way we should go,</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 2077 looking at compliance and then managing taxation based on that. The second point I would like to make, I would like to credit the FRCS is they have started focusing on MSMEs as a specific area of interest. They now have a unit that actually deals with MSMEs. We are working very closely with that Unit and again in terms of rebuilding this country, that piece of work will ensure that we continue to make the small steps in order to rebuild this country, rebuild the architecture and alleviate poverty which is something that these Members have mentioned for 16 years, all they did was take us backwards. HON. P. D KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the kind of response you get when he has nothing much to say about the subject matter. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRCS play a very important role in the revenue collection, and it also assists in the overall development of Fiji. In other words, for revenue and customs services if they do not collect the revenue the Government is crippled. They will not be able to provide the services that we often talk about, for example, the support system that we need to provide to the vulnerable group or the roads that are needed in the rural areas. We need the revenue but who are the people who are paying these revenue to FRCS and collecting all these? It is definitely the taxpayers of this country, whether you are running a business or you are an employee or sole trader, whatever you are, there are certain amount of taxes and duties levied which is collected by FRCS. In other words, FRCS’ real client are the public, Fijians, people who live in this country and, therefore, it is very important for them to be customer centric service oriented. For that, over the years FRCS underwent major reform, they continue to reform the taxation system from the customers’ point of view, they focused on simplifying tax administration system for better customer service experience. FRCS introduced the standard interpretation guideline to remove subjective decision making and for the first time automated economic operator programme was introduced for its trusted traders who are accorded benefits by the customs in the movement of international cargo. Sir, IT investments were also made by the Government to assist FRCS in designing and implementing an online new tax system. Again, all that was done so that things become easier for the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to provide a better avenue for aggrieved taxpayers, Fiji also has a tax court which further builds confidence in our taxpayers and investors. So, it is not one way, if people are aggrieved, they can take their matter to the tax court and recently the tax court had ordered FRCS to return a sum of $26 million to a foreign company; that builds confidence in the system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these reforms took place during FijiFirst Government with the intent to shift away from the authoritarian mindset to promoting a service-oriented approach where the goal is to enhance the overall experience of those receiving services. In this regard, the Committee also recommended that FRCS identify areas of improvement to enhance the customer survey rating, which was 2.55 out of 5, and suggested that they need to develop better strategies to improve this customer service. It was interesting to note when you go through the Report where the staff in terms of atmosphere within FRCS and how staff are operating within FRCS, they gave a very high rate which</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>2078 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 means it is a very conducive environment to work which is good but do the customers feel the same? Well, this rating shows the other way. Fiji Financial Intelligence Report, it identified the two top possible underlying criminal activities identified in the suspicious transaction reporting were tax evasion, frauds and scams were right there than anything else which means we still have people who are avoiding tax and FRCS is trying their best to arrest that but for the Government, it is loss of revenue. Every effort must be made to recover every cent that people owe, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, again, if you read the report during the year, FRCS paid around half a million dollar to whistleblowers which is again a very good strategy to encourage people to come up and report tax evasion. Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kamikamica mentioned that Ministry of Women are collecting data and creating a database so that correctly we can identify the vulnerable groups and we can pay them et cetera. Let me make it very clear rather than each Ministry making their own little database to give this and that, it is important to work on the national ID for each and every citizen; that is the way forward. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the honourable Members, I thank the Chairman of the Committee. I think the contributions from the honourable Members have been very good. I thank the contribution from the opposition both from honourable Nath and honourable Kumar. Mr. Speaker, FRCS as rightly pointed out is a very critical and important arm of Government because as honourable Kumar said quite rightly, if this organisation does not collect the revenue, the whole fiscal situation, revenue and expenditure for Government is dependent on how effective and efficiently we are able to implement all the tax policies, how efficiently and effectively we are able to collect revenue? If you look at the contributions that we have had so far from yesterday and the budget debate, despite the articulation of how Government should manage their budget. There is always, Mr. Speaker, Sir, demand for more expenditure, demand for more revenue from every sector of the economy and the Government has to have that fiscal space to be able to provide those services. What has happened, Mr Speaker, Sir, over the years apart from notwithstanding the impact of Covid-19 and the devastation on the economy. What we have seen over the last 10 years or 12 years is a kind of economics (what I can voodoo economics) where we have concentrated on borrowing, spending and perhaps, not looking at it carefully on how we can also mobilise resources through the appropriate tax system. In the 2023-2024 budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have carefully navigated our way, we have made sure that we provide a platform in the budget where we are able to collect reasonable amount of revenue, where we are able to than put out the appropriate expenditure into appropriate sectors, particularly health, social welfare, agriculture that all has seen an increase in the last budget. So as a government, what we are looking at, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to make sure and I take all the points that have been raised by honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica and honourable Premila Kumar about what FRCS is and how it has changed. The allocation for FRCS in the current budget is about $45.5 million. This is an increase of about 13.8 percent compared to the budget of $40 million for the last financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this increase in budget is timely for the newly unveiled strategic plan that has substantial plans, objectives and once operationalised effectively, it can produce substantial windfall gains not only for the organisation but for the government as a whole in terms of collecting revenue. Honourable Nath talked about the basket, in fact, it is not 2008 it is 2014, the base that they are using to calculate the CPI and I agree with him. The Bureau of Statistics, we have brought back the Government Statistician who was unceremoniously removed by the previous Government. The</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 2079 Bureau of Statistics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is already working on re-basing the calculation of CPI. We are going to also re-look at the basket, his is right, it is an old basket, things have changed, consumption patterns have changed, we need to look at the weights. While sessions from some of the Members, unlike a very good contribution from honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Vijay Nath on specific suggestions about how the cost of living has increased simply because of the budget or because of the new tax measures, they do not realise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are still transitioning from the impact of COVID, loss of jobs and loss of income. What the figure show, as I had pointed out yesterday, Mr. Speaker, there is job growth, in fact, as I have said, in the formal sector. This is FNPF data which shows that the salaries and wages have actually increased somewhere between 10 percent to 12 percent, which is also a factor of the demand for are tight labour market. We have lost some labour but the other side of the coin is that there are more jobs being created as well. All I am saying is that, in the FRCS, contrary to the assertions that was made by the honourable Member who is not in Parliament now that we will lose tax revenue because the disposable income has gone down and because the cost of living is so high, in fact, for October 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, net tax collection is $26 million or 10.7 percent above the forecast, compared to the same period last year. Tax revenue is higher by about $18.9 million or 43.8 percent and it comes from a number of measures that we have in the budget and if you look at the increase in revenue, we are adding about $500 million to $600 million as a permanent increase in revenue into the budget. And if you look at the expenditure that has gone out of that, increase in the social welfare Ministry’s budget, increase in the education budget, increase in the health budget. We are fixing some of the infrastructure in the health sector. I was in Nausori the other day and I met people and they were related by the fact that after so many years of neglect of the Nausori Health Centre, suddenly it is being renovated. Similar things we have done in the last 10 months throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go to Dreketi, Wainikoro and Korovou you will see Government quarters being painted now. The things are happening, and I have been told that the CWM Hospital is for the first time in many years, you know that clean that people can go there. So, these are things that are happening as a result of what we have done and all these, Mr. Speaker, can be done properly if we are able to collect enough revenue. So as a Government we have put all these measures. If we did not take some of these tax measures if we did not look at FRCS as an important institution that can collect this on the basis of the policies of the Government, we will not be able to do this. I urge honourable Members on the other side when they speak to look at the facts of what is happening. On the part of Government we will continue to support FRCS. I think we have seen what they are capable of doing. There has been a lot of efficiencies that I have seen in the last six months coming out of the organisation and I want to take this opportunity to thank the Board and all those who are at the helm at the moment for driving and making sure that Government’s policies - measures in the Budget are effectively implemented and revenue collected. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their valuable contribution on the Report. We realise the important role that FRCS placed its contribution to revenue collection. We would like to thank FRCS for the reforms that they have undertaken as we believe that it will significantly contribute to revenue collection in this country.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>2080 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 We also noted the support being provided by the Government in trying to strengthen FRCS through the Budget support and we hope that this will enhance the performance of FRCS to continue their role in revenue collection for this country. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. The motion is agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have just been informed that dinner is ready in the Big Committee Room. I intend to adjourn Parliament now. We come back after dinner to complete the two remaining motions.
