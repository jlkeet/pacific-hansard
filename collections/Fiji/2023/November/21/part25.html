<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TRADE ANDTOURISM 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TRADE AND TOURISM 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism 2018-2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 14 th July, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Report on the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism 2018-2019 Annual Report in July this year. The Ministry represents some of Fiji’s most important sectors that impacts the socio- economic development. The Tourism Industry contributes significantly to Fiji’s economy as the country’s largest foreign exchange earner. The Committee was informed of the importance of the International Visitor’s Survey to improve services. Furthermore, the Committee noted the significance of the impact of cruise tourism and the need to engage with Municipal Councils and other stakeholders to improve and market the unique cultural activities in the different centres and geographical locations in Fiji. The Committee noted the significance of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and strongly recommend that MSMEs Fiji needs to engage with all stakeholders to further develop the sector. In addition, the Committee received contributions from the Fiji Development Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture, Business Assistance Fiji and the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council. The Committee commends the Ministry on the launch of this Fiji Portal and looks forward on a positive result on future Annual Reports. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- The motion is now open for debate and before I offer the floor, there are four speakers that have been identified by the Whips. They are:</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>2086 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 (1) Honourable Jone Usamate; (2) Assistant Minister, honourable Alitia Bainivalu; (3) Honourable Premila Kumar; and (4) Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk on this Report. I congratulate the Committee for the outstanding work that it has done in the Report and the various recommendations that have been done. The Ministry, of course, as we know is a very critical one in terms of the lifeblood of our economy and I just like to talk to some of the recommendations that are there, and I congratulate the Committee for the recommendations that it has done. The first recommendation that I want to talk briefly about is the second one. It is the importance of strengthening standards for development, implementation and monitoring for trade promotion in consumer protection. The Committee has actually recommended that there should be a standard unit to become a statutory entity. I think that is a very good suggestion because the world over we note that Governments are beginning to change to take out a lot of these operational activities out of the ambit of Government proper or it maintains the policy and regulatory role and set up these bodies. I think that will be a good move. The only thing that we have to make sure is that if the standards unit is set up to be a unit on its own then it must be able to be sustainable. It should not be such that Government has to come in and then to keep funding this unit. So, I think overall that is a good policy drive, that is why we created things like Fiji Roads Authority and Water Authority of Fiji. We take out the direct operational arms into specific entities so they can be quick and nimble and get on with the lot. So that recommendation I agree with them entirely. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second one that I want to talk about briefly too in my five minutes is the first recommendation in terms of MSMEs and in terms of MSMEs, micro enterprises is something that we all need to look after and we should congratulate people who sell BBQ on the roadside, people who sell fruit drinks, people who sell kava, we should not make fun of them because these people are trying to struggle to make a living and as they graduate from Micro to Small to Medium Enterprises, that is something that we should encourage. I am glad to see that there has been quite a lot of work done in the Ministry in terms of this MSME Fiji and the BAF programme that was identified by the honourable Koroilavesau. I had noticed here is that, what this recommendation is trying to do, is a very important one. Because what you tend to find is that, Ministries try to create their own empires, so if someone is doing micro enterprise here, someone else wants to create it again. So, the idea of consolidating that altogether under one umbrella is a very good one. It eliminates duplication and allows us to be able to focus our resources much better on what needs to be done. So, I am totally in agreement with the first recommendation that we have. The third recommendation is something that I had the opportunity of participating in some of the Committees. This particular recommendation no. 3 is recommending for future repots to have their achievements against KPIs. This is very important. A lot of reports just talk about activities, we did this and we did that. What we really want to know is what you have done relative to your targets, your outputs and the outcomes. What have you achieved out of your activities? This is a good and solid recommendation, and I think this is something we should make sure that all Government Ministries should do. When they report, do not just report on the activities, but what was the output, and the outcome. What has been the trend over the past few years, you can see, the trend is improving. That is a very good recommendation.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 2087 The last one, and I think it is probably related to recommendation no. 4, which is talking about the Fiji’s trade commissions, which were not reflected in the report. Hopefully, I am sure the Ministry would be looking into that. Along the same lines, we need to know whether they are getting money out of these establishments, the trade commissions, the trade departments, and it should not be activity based. It must be output against the target, leading to outcome and showing a trend of a number of years. That will give us a good information to discuss in this Parliament and to see what needs to be improved. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge and thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for their assessment and the compilation of this Report. I would like to commend the Ministry for incorporating the alignment of its work with the UNs SDGs as well as having an unqualified audit opinion. As highlighted in the Chair’s foreword, the Ministry represented some of Fiji’s most important sectors that impact the socio-economic development of the country, with tourism being the driver of our economy, contributing close to 40 percent to our GDP. The years leading up to 2019 was a record year for tourism. In the period under review, we welcomed 895,137 visitors, a 4 percent increase from the previous financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year has been one of the books for the Fiji tourism industry. For the first nine months of this year, Fiji welcomed 689,142 visitors, which is a 2 percent increase over the same period pre-COVID-19 with visitors mostly from Australia, New Zealand. US and China. In addition to exploring the new destinations, Fiji’s efforts to enhance regional connectivity remains a priority. At the end of this month, Fiji Airways will commence its new service between Fiji and New Caledonia. There will also be direct flights from Nadi to French Polynesia by Aircalin starting in December. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka for being elected as the Chair of the International Civil Aviation Organisation Conference that is currently underway in Dubai. I would like to take this opportunity to commend some of the work done by the Department of Tourism, who are now part of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. In the 2018 to 2019 financial year, Cabinet endorsed the Fijian tourism 2021, Fiji’s tourism sectorial plan, which sets the strategic priorities of the industry. As shared in this Parliament, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation is now close to finalising a 10-year strategy that will build upon the Fijian tourism 2021 document. Mr. Speaker, two very important studies were also commissioned in an effort to create strong linkages and diverse our tourism products: (1) The assessment of the economic impact of cruise tourism in Fiji. The assessment identified seven investment opportunities that if pursued would lead to an added USD $43.98 million to the Fijian economy in the next 10 years. (2) From the farm to the tourist table study which shows hotels and resorts in Fiji’s main tourism areas spent over $75 million buying fresh produce in 2017, with 48 percent of that spent on locally items. It also identifies barriers to increasing local production such as poor networking between hotel chefs, purchasing managers, suppliers and farmers and outline recommendations to increase local food sourcing by Fiji’s tourism sector. Mr. Speaker, implementation of the recommendations of these reports also commence such as the chef training undertaken in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture in the Coral Coast and</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>2088 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 in Rakiraki. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share that the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation will in this financial year continue this so that we see more of local produce and cuisine been used in the industry. Another commendable achievement of the Department was the successful rollout of the modernise online international visitors survey. The IVS is available tool not just for the Department but for other Government stakeholders and industry from April to December of 2022 587, 406 visitors arrived and contributed $3 billion to the economy. Approximately, 47 percent of spending occurred prior to arrival and approximately 54 percent of spending occurred after arrival. The average visitors spend was around FJD $3,572 per trip and around FJD $376 per night. The average spending per trip has increased by six percent. Mr. Speaker, such insights are possible when we prioritise robust data collection and reporting. I would also like to commend the Ministry and the Tourism Fiji’s efforts in promoting Fiji as a top sporting destination by hosting events like super rugby and earlier this month I am pleased to share that we successfully hosted the Fiji’s Spartan Event. This event brought over 3,000 participants from 25 countries to Sabeto over four days. To conclude, I commend the achievements of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism and their contribution to the economy. Thank you for giving me the floor Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you and I now offer the floor to the honourable Premila Kumar to make her contribution. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. Ministry of Industry Trade and Tourism (MITT) is responsible for developing and implementing policies and strategies to shape Fiji’s economic landscape. The Ministry’s policies and initiatives have a direct impact on job creation and overall economic prosperity. We have seen the effort made the hard-working staff of MITT to come up with strategies to create supportive environment for the growth and success of businesses at different stages of development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years MITT has introduced innovative programmes and policies such as start-up incubators, skilled development programmes, market access and support programmes regulatory simplification in e-gov services example base Fiji. Incentives for innovation research and development, access to finance by collaborating with RBF, FDB and Ministry of Finance by setting up this credit guarantee scheme. Also, MITT came up with community engagement initiatives that have been organising networking events and workshops including recognition and awards and that is where we have the Prime Minister’s International Business Awards. They are also involved in international collaboration for exports, and they continue to provide business advisory services to the clients. So, they do all these works and Recommendation (7) clearly states that this institution must be well resourced. If they are well-resourced then they will be able to deliver better. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the committee had the opportunity to hold a round table meeting with varies Government agencies and entities involved in MSME’s space. From this meeting it was crystal clear that there was lack of coordination and cooperation amongst them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, MITT set up the SME Unit by consolidating varies programmes and funding within the Ministry with the intention of reducing the bureaucratic hurdles and creating a more accessible and efficient ecosystem for MSMEs.</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 2089 There is a lot of merit in Recommendation No. 1, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We suggest that SME Fiji should be able to respond to the dynamic needs of the private sector and particularly, NSME small business, small and micro businesses and MSME Fiji can then think like a private sector and operate like a private sector, and not like a government entity - involved too much in bureaucracy and this and that. It will allow better collaboration between different parties, and it will be able to address the unique challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a statutory body, MSME Fiji will have a greater visibility both, domestically and internationally, and that is when it can tap into donor funding. They can also tap into human resources, and it will be able to coordinate with other MSME programmes dished out by other agencies. So, it will give better value for money by consolidating all these under one roof. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also recommended the replication of the Northern Development Programme to other Divisions in Fiji. Sir, NDP as we call it, was initially established in 2007 to address the severe impact of the expiry of sugarcane leases on the economy of the North. The NDP actually comes under the ‘Look North Policy’ and under that when this programme was introduced, it became highly successful and the recipe for success was that anyone that was entrusted to tap into NDP had to get commercial loan and if they get the loan, then the Ministry will provide the grant. There was a lot of handholding, making sure that when they started off with the business at every step they were guided, they were mentored and that produced the results because they knew their money is also involved in the project. So, it was extremely successful in 2019. The success rate was about 84 percent which is very high and even this grant was not given just like that, it was disbursed based on what their needs are. If it needs to be paid to the supplier, then it is paid to the supplier, it was not given cash on hand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I just want to go back in 2019, when the MITT report was being discussed in this Parliament the honourable Prime Minister then the leader of the Opposition and later SODELPA Leader, honourable Gavoka raised their concerns on PACER Plus. The question was Fiji had not signed the agreement while other pacific Island countries has signed PACER Plus in 2017. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request honourable Kamikamica to provide the position of the Coalition Government on this matter, so that we are clear on that. Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Premila Kumar. I now offer the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister honourable Kamikamica. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know it is getting on late in the evening so I will be as quick as I possibly can. As I rise to contribute to the Report into the Ministry of Industry Trade and Tourism 2018-2019 Annual Report, I thank the Committee for their contributions and recommendations. We all agree, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (MITT) as it was back then called and now it is somehow different because tourism has peeled away from the Ministry, but they have a pivotal role to play as a key driver, enabler, facilitator in creating a friendly business environment and creating investment opportunities in our country, stimulating SME growth co-operatives in Fiji which are very important to the People’s Coalition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations which have been discussed by the preceding speakers are helpful and instructive, and some of them, I would like to sort of touch on today. So my discussion today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will touch briefly on the report but try and provide a bit of a feel to the Members of the august Parliament, on where the Trade Ministry and the Communication Ministry is headed, going forward. In terms of the MSMEs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, right</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>2090 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 now, as the Committee had recommended that a statutory body be considered. I think that is probably a journey that we will take as a Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Right now, from what we can see, there is a very good ecosystem already being developed in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir and some of the key entities have been mentioned by respective parties here today; Business Assistance Fiji, by honourable Koroilavesau. The FDB, of course, MSME Fiji and there is also a tremendous level of accelerator programmes already evolving through private sector participation and that is one of the fundamental key things that we are trying to develop in this MSME ecosystem to try and encourage private sector to provide their support to the MSME sector. You would have seen recently that Tappoos announced, and I was honoured to be at the ceremony that they were announcing that they support their own MSMEs in their business. That is quite a significant added contribution by the Tappoo Group. We thank them for that. And that, in itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be an impetus for more activity and more opportunity for the MSMEs that are in that sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, BSP Life now has a training for entrepreneurs. There are about 25 women and men that they train every six months, and they are committed to do this over a period of five years. So, in a period of five years, 250 potential entrepreneurs and existing entrepreneurs will get expertise in that kind of training. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the MSME sector, yes, it is fundamental. At the moment, it is only 18 percent of GDP according to statistics. We would like it to sit around 30 or 40 percent of GDP, but to do that, it requires building a comprehensive ecosystem that we are currently in the process of doing. In terms of the co-operatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are seeing good growth in co-operatives. In 2018-2019, there were about 371 co-operatives in existence. Now there is about 545, and it is growing. We will continue to use that as a means to stimulate the economic growth in our country and it is a fundamental part as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the MSME ecosystem that is currently developing, and we hope to bring more direction to the Parliament next year. In terms of the trade needed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the most important units in our Ministry and just very briefly, they have been involved in some very significant negotiations, the most recent of which was the IPAF negotiations which has been substantively concluded in San Francisco. The honourable Prime Minister was also in San Francisco to attend the first High Level Meeting in San Francisco. It was initiated by the Fiji First Government, it will be a significant economic agreement for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It represents 40 percent of the GDP in the world and there are 14 countries, and Fiji is there as the Small Island Developing State representative, and we expect to benefit quite significantly from that initiative. Just very briefly, we talked about standards, and I agree with the sentiments raised about standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, I have convened a taskforce that is just looking at standards in the country. It is an inter-agency collaboration, and it is interesting that it came up through the recommendations of the Committee. And we are looking very closely at the creation of improved standards for Fiji, and it is something that we can work on going forward. Finally, the question around the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus. I am happy to report that one of the reasons why we have been, if you like, slow on PACER Plus is basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Trade Team which is only about four people who are totally immersed in the Inter Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) negotiations but we have very clearly</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report – MITT 2018-2019 Annual Report 2091 articulated to colleagues in New Zealand and Australia that now that the substantive negotiations are over that we will begin the engagement on PACER Plus with the view to coming up with the position next year. In terms of PACER Plus, we all know that there are genuine concerns on the Fiji side and those will be looked at very carefully in terms of the overall position that we finally take PACER Plus. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final comment I want to pick up from honourable Usamate was that he did mention - the need for KPIs, and that is something that we have been discussing in the Ministry as well. It will be worthwhile, for instance, to have good data on investment in Fiji. We do not even have a hand on how much foreign direct investment or local direct investment we have in Fiji, depending on who you talk to we do not know what the number is. So that is an area that we are looking at. Those are some of the things that we can use to really measure how our economy is doing, how well it is doing and also the Ministry is also committing some resources into that endeavour. With that short contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank this opportunity to contribute very briefly. I have not spoken at length about the historical report but try to sprinkle the appetite with a little bit of forward thinking and I support the Report of the Committee. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution on the Report. The comments were very valuable and, of course, very insightful. I hope that the comments would assist in improving the performance of the Ministry as they forge ahead in trying to deliver services to the people of this country. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the agenda for the sitting today. I thank you all for your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 7.54 p.m.</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>Reply to Written Question No. 168/2023 tabled on Tuesday, 21 st November, 2023 by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Ref.
