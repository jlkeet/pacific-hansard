A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation Annual Report for the reporting period from 1 st August, 2018 to 31 st July, 2019 which was tabled on 5 th April, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 2067 HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation oversees three departments - the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Women and the Department of Poverty Monitoring Unit. The Department of Social Welfare administers Fiji’s Social Welfare Programmes which include the: (1) Poverty Benefits Scheme; (2) Child Protection Allowance; (3) Food Voucher Programme; and (4) Social Pension Scheme. In managing these Programmes, the Department is responsible for ensuring that assistance target those most in need and eliminating corruption and fraud in the process. Mr. Speaker, the Department’s statutory responsibilities to ensure the protection and wellbeing of children which includes managing Juvenile Centres. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the Department also manages three State-owned homes for senior citizens and plays a leading role in the National Council for Older Persons and the National Coordinating Committee for Children. The Department of Women and Children is responsible for mainstreaming gender in the Public Service through the National Gender Policy and does so by promoting and protecting the Rights of Women and Girls through the implementation of the National Women’s Plan of Action. Mr. Speaker, the National Women’s Plan of Action is aimed at boosting women’s employment opportunities, increasing women’s participation in decision making, eliminating violence against women and girls, improving Women’s Access to Basic Services and Addressing Women’s issues in new legislations. The Department works with other Ministries to promote gender equality, to ensure gender perspective are addressed in all Government policies and initiatives. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Poverty Monitoring Unit evaluates Government’s poverty related programmes and makes policy recommendations to the Ministry and Cabinet. The Department is committed to ensuring that all such programmes deliver tangible outcomes that improved livelihoods and reduce poverty. Mr. Speaker, in the 2018-2019 financial year, the Ministry received its highest budget over the years. This had enabled the Ministry to provide better for the welfare of the neediest Fijians by sustaining all existing social and protections programmes administered by the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry continues to work in collaboration with its stakeholders and partners from Government and civil society to ensure the best possible results were obtained from its work and reviewed areas that needed improvement for better service delivery. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry continued the implementation of its plan in place for policy changes, projects, programmes and better adherence to international governing instruments of the United Nations and other international and regional organisations that Fiji has ratified in relation to the benefits of its clientele. Mr. Speaker, the Committee is yet to receive the substantive response on the Standing Committee Report as according to Standing Order 121(6)(b) which requires the agency to provide</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>2068 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 its response within 21 days of receiving the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate, honourable Members. I have a list of speakers before me supplied by the Whips. There are two each from both the Government and the Opposition. Honourable Tuinaceva will lead the batting followed by the Minister for Women, honourable Tabuya and then followed by honourable Sachida Nand and then it should be rounded of by the honourable Assistant Minister Sashi Kiran. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution on the motion before Parliament. At the outset I just want to thank the Committee for the work done in putting the Report together. On Recommendation, Item 4.2 of the Report the call to the Ministry to work in collaboration with other relevant Government agencies and NGOs to address and reduce the number of street dwellers. The simple term most people understand is ‘homeless’, the modern term they use nowadays in many countries is “streetism.” In fact, to be honest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am disappointed that we have decided to settle for second best which is to reduce and not to eradicate street dwelling problems in our country. There are countries that do not have homeless problems or the lowest rate. They have successfully battled homelessness by focusing on prevention, early intervention and a comprehensive support system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about a special case of extreme concern, and that is the increase in the number of children who are below the age of 16, who are dwellers, especially in Suva. I always want to believe that with the kind of family values and network, religion and vanua systems in our community, on which it is founded on, no one should be homeless in this country. I do not think that we have reached a crisis point. I believe that we better work, or deal with this problem and we still can do that. The figures released in 2018 and 2019 Report says that 37 minors roamed or lived in towns but have been returned home. A survey conducted by a prominent media agency in 2022 stated that close to 20 children, the youngest being nine, live and sleep under Stinson Parade Bridge every night and they do not want to return home. However, in June this year, it was confirmed by mthe Police through a media report that there were more than 30 adults and children living on our streets, namely Suva. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through talanoa with the children themselves, we found out that there were more than 20 children alone who were homeless in Suva. They get shelters to sleep at Thurston Garden, Suva Market and under Stinson Parade Bridge. When you talk to these kids, we can easily put them into three groups: street living, street working or street family. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is: why children leave home and come to live on the streets? Every single child we talked to has their own unique story. Economic poverty plays a major role, although other factors are of equal importance. Some have been pushed into the streets because, they have been forced into criminal activities, or being rejected from the family for so call moral reasons, some have mental issues or substance abuse while some are through peer pressure. The big question is, how can we help these children go back home or move away from the street life? They do want to go back home. They will even share the views on what needs to be addressed to make them go back home. The assistance like, provide them with food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare, love, protection and basic rights. Assistance like, to provide them with an opportunity for a career outside</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 2069 of begging. Assistance like, prevent conflict with their family, if we can do that, or to reduce poverty in the community and homes. Enforce law systems to protect them, promote their integration into the society and also encourage more programmes that support them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Ministry, NGOs and other institutions and agencies are trying to take children away from the streets, we all need to ask the question: how through parenting can Fiji control children coming down to the streets? Tackle the problem at home! For a child to decide to come down to the streets, it does not happen overnight. So, why wait for the problem to happen? Why cannot education and awareness on this “streetism” be taken down to parents through agencies and some kind of preventative measures? We need to create detection and early intervention measures, we need a support system that involves everyone, including government, communities, regional organisations, vanua NGOs and the people! Everyone to work together to save our generation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of these children went through a normal life in the beginning of their journey. Something not normal happened along the way which drove them to the streets. I am sure if that not normal is addressed, most of the children will willingly go back home. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the Parliament. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to commend the Committee for their great work in reviewing the Annual Report from 2018 to 2019 which is four years later now. I thank the honourable Tuinaceva for raising that issue about our street children and as you know, my Assistant Minister honourable Sashi Kiran has been spearheading the work in this regard from the Ministry so I will let her address the issue. It is an issue that speaks to all of our hearts and something that we all agree on, is the need to take better care of our children. In the report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee does talk about the need to have legislation as well as the need to strengthen the new Department of Children. Currently, the budget that has been allocated, $100,000 for this budget year is really to set up the Department of Children with skeletal staff including the Director of Children which we are finalising the interviews. As s we prepare for the new budget year, we are to put together our programmes that will then justify the budget to have it up and running fully. We still have the Child Services Unit, but it will become a fully-fledged Department in the next financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to work towards that, we have been working with UNICEF, so thank UNICEF as our development partner to partner with us on coming up with an overarching vision of the Department of Children and to strengthen any existing programmes targeted at the care and protection of children which does include what honourable Kiran will cover. The other recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Report is the need to fill the vacant positions in the Ministry. When we came into Government, there were 76 vacancies, we have advertised for 50 which is provided for in this budget and we hope to cover the balance in the next budget. We have interviewed and we are finalising in the last three months 38 positions so far. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to strengthen the Department of Children, we currently are looking within the Ministry to reach out to any welfare officers who will want to become full time child welfare officers, so we are now going to demarcate those roles so that you have those that work in social protection and those at work in child welfare. So hopefully it will contribute to improving the services for our children, otherwise our welfare officers are dealing with adults and children 24/7 and it is a really tough job. I commend our welfare officers for the great work they do.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>2070 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of working closely with the Turaga ni Koro and advisory councillors on our Poverty Alleviation Programmes, Poverty Monitoring Unit as I had stated yesterday has been reviewing programmes across Ministries and have come up with recommendations which include the need for greater engagement with the Turaga ni Koro and advisory councillors to be aware and to also monitor and report back on our Poverty Alleviation Programmes on all the ministries across the board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point about the timely manner to determine our recipients. Yes, we have a way to go but as I had stated earlier, we are digitising our database in the hope to make our systems more efficient. I apologise to the public, there are sometimes cases that falls through the cracks, we ask you to please visit your nearest office and raise that issue so we can attend to it. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to wrap up, the honourable Leader of the Opposition had asked yesterday about programmes that have been underutilised. One of the issues raised in the Report is the Welfare Graduate Programme, which is one of those programmes that has been underutilised in the past, where money was given, for example, there was allocation from the World Bank of $2 million but by the time it came into Government, only $400,000 was utilised. So, it was underutilisation for Jobs4Nature Programme. However, we are now stepping it up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we digitise the database, we now have identified close to 3,000 recipients who potentially should not be in the database or should not be receiving welfare. We will not just kick them off because really welfare is for temporary shocks, you should not be on the programme for many years. It is really to buffer and so we are looking at these recipients to graduate them out of the programme and with that assistance from TVET, the Ministry of Education as well as the Ministry for Youth in reviving some of our Youth Centres around the country, it assists us to be able to transition them out of the welfare into training programmes and then as the honourable Prime Minister had mentioned, Apprenticeship Programmes and then finally to meaningful employment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for their work, and I commend the Report before Parliament. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to commend the Ministry for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation Annual Report. I must start by thanking the Government for increasing the allocation to the Ministry for Women and Social Protection. It is a commendable job, however, there is a question which I ask, “Is the Ministry or the Government serious about our poverty alleviation and bringing people out of social issues?” Passing belittling comments on people and discouraging them is not a way forward in dealing with the issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just this morning the honourable Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister stated, “go and do roadside BBQ”. I do not do roadside BBQ.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I did not say that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- This is a direct insult on hundreds of roadside BBQ sellers who work hard to make ends meet. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. First of all, irrelevance and also the honourable Member is misleading. He said …. HON. S. NAND.- What is the Point of Order?</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 2071 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- He said that I was taking too many trips and I said, “you want me to do roadside BBQ instead of doing this job.... (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 44, so I think he should not mislead that. MR. SPEAKER.- Continue honourable Sachida. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is a usual trend of the honourable Member to back track what he is saying. This is an insult to the hundreds of people who sell roadside BBQs to makes ends meet. These are the people who do hard work to feed the people. These are not the people who go around texting other people’s wives, inviting them over; these are not the people It is important that these people should be, we are talking about poverty alleviation. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is imputing improper motive. He knows what happened and he knows how that matter was disposed off. I think his totally going down to gutter level and insulting, hurling insults using this parliamentary Chamber. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Sachida, could you just continue with your speech rather than….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I must stress, I did not state any names.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Withdraw that statement:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> I am not going to withdraw, I did not state any names. There are no names stated. But if the shoe fits, wear it, please. It is important that we need to work towards alleviating poverty. It is important that people who are doing hard work, who are trying to make ends meet are desperately working, we should assist them and encourage them. People need assistance on time. There is one of the recommendations in the Report … MR. SPEAKER.- I have not ruled, honourable Sachida. We have gone overboard here into a very sticky situation. It is for and against. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics said something to the effect of BBQ, and then you have come up with another one to counter that one, on texting some women. So, I strongly suggest and implore upon each and every one of us here, just to debate in a proper way rather than stooping low and doing gutter level attack on each other because it does not augur well. You will end up breaching some privileges, and then we will be loaded with the task of trying to come up with another way of rectifying all these problems when the milk has already been spilt. That is what I try and implore upon each and every one of you. Honourable Sachida, you continue with the way you are addressing this motion and that is good and stay there, please. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the poverty in the country, as we see it on the ground,</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>2072 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 is increasing. People are struggling to make ends meet. If people are denying it, go to a supermarket on a Saturday or Friday and see parents with children trying to pick things from the shelves, and many a times, the children are left crying because the parent cannot afford to pick that stuff out of the shelf. Things have gone beyond the reach of ordinary people, and this is a social issue that we need to address. How can we decrease the cost of living for our people? The economy may be booming, may be in the tourism sector, but the other sectors are struggling. People are struggling to put food on the table. This is a social issue. This Report recommends that assistance needs to be given on time, and that is what we are asking for. The assistance should be given on time and people’s cost of living needs to be brought down. People need to be able to put decent meal on the table. Are we working towards that? Are we talking about that? I do not see anyone doing that. Why are we putting other policies in front of the normal citizens issues, the normal issues that our citizens are dealing with? We need to ensure that people are able to feed themselves. Food on the table is the primary course for people, the primary objective is food on the table, and secondary is everything else. I highly recommend the Ministry together with the Government, to look into these issues. Social problem arises when people cannot live comfortably. Street children arise when people cannot feed their children and they run away from home. We need to look into all these things. It is one of the causes of social problems. Poverty is one of the causes of social issues, so let us look at poverty seriously, and I hope this Government and the Ministry will deal with this issue. With that, I support the motion in Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Sachida Nand for your contribution and I now offer the floor to the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection for her contribution. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the former Minister, Permanent Secretary and the Ministry Team for their work in serving our people. The Ministry has a huge responsibility to serve our people, there is no two ways about it. I would like to remind the honourable Member that this Report is four years old and since the honourable Member has discussed about other recommendations, I will just discuss the issue of street kids, Recommendation 4.2. Mr. Speaker, until this year while there was a taskforce for street dwellers and there were profiled over the years there did not exist a programme to help them lived out of their situation. Wherever possible they were taken to their families and most children landed back on the streets. There is a very strong commitment to the most vulnerable by the Coalition Government which is not only indicated by the increase in social protection alarms for the vulnerable with an allocation of $200.2 million overall by far the biggest ever allocation to this Ministry but also visible by the high level of commitment to the work on assisting our people on the streets. I wish to thank the honourable Attorney-General, the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, the honourable Minister for Youths, the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs for their high level of commitment towards the support of our efforts to help us work with the street dwellers. Over the past few months, we have had very strong partnerships between different Government Ministries and Civil Society sector including the churches in trying to find solutions for people living on the streets. This year, we have profiled 144 people in the Suva-Nausori corridor, 14 were found to be below the ages of 14, 66 between 15 to 35, 47 between 36 and 59 and 17 above the age of 60.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Review Report–Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation August 2018-July 2019 Annual Report 2073 Mr. Speaker, 31people were profiled in the West; 26 below the age of 14. There were 68 new persons identified in the last few weeks rather and are currently being profiled. Mr. Speaker, 157 of those profiled have been placed in either a State home, Faith Based Shelter or reunited with the family. Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, 12 street kids are in a Home undergoing rehabilitation and will be joining the Ministry of Youth Seeds of Success Programme to be held later this month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, seven others have been enrolled in a yearlong rehabilitation programme, 12 from Lautoka have been trained under the Ministry of Youth Programme Seeds of Success and another batch is ready to start. Mr. Speaker, Sir, six joined TVET: 15 were trained by Red Cross and once trained there are pathways identified for job placements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 35 street dwellers have been placed in various Aged Care Homes or to seek treatment from St. Giles. There are 23 street dwellers we are working within Suva who keep returning. There have been efforts made to support beggars with income generation, social protection however some of them struggled with being integrated with their families and land back on the streets. Where needed some of these people are referred to social support. In order to be able to reach out to street dwellers and build trust, we have worked with different organisations who have been feeding street dwellers and Faith Based Organisations to reach out and help start rehabilitation. I wish to acknowledge Faith Based Groups for opening up shelters for these youths and different Government Ministries for opening up the training facilities, in particular Salvation Army that has opened up a shelter in Lautoka and Suva for their rehabilitation. There are some very committed volunteers within Salvation Army who have been actively supporting the work. I also wish to thank the Methodist Church for availing their facilities in Serua that be used for rehabilitation. The Ministry of Youth has also been very supportive with not only availing their motivational programmes for the young but also the training facilities. Mr. Speaker, increasing number of dysfunctional families, drug abuse and neglect are seeing some increasing numbers on our streets. However, Mr. Speaker, we are committed, and I thank all partners on the taskforce who have been working tirelessly to provide support to those on our streets. With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in Reply. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their comments and contributions on the Motion before Parliament. Also, I would like to wish the honourable Minister and honourable Assistant Minister the very best in implementing the various programmes within the Ministry to better serve our women and our children. I thank you. Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>2074 Review Report–FRCS 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st Nov., 2023 Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
