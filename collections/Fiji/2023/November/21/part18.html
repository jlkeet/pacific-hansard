<body><h3>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023</h3><h4>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the – (a) Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 29/2023), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd November, 2023, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 and why Parliament must consider it without delay. The Local Government Act 1972 is the primary legislation that regulates, amongst other things, the governance of local government. In its practical note on the topic, decentralised governance for development, a combined practice note on decentralisation, local governance and urban-rural development, the United Nation’s programme has articulated that to quote: “For development and governance to be fully responsive and representational people and institutions must be empowered at every level of society; national, provincial, district, city, town and village.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government currently oversees 13 Municipal Councils - two City Councils and 11 Town Councils. However, the last Local Government Elections was held in 2005 and since then, Municipal Councils have been governed by appointed Administrators. For over 17 years, the Local Government Elections have not taken place. That is a history. We have a collective responsibility to provide our people with a chance to elect councillors that will safeguard the interest in various municipalities. Local Government elections serve as the most accessible means for the public to engage with the authorities and State institutions, and for these institutions to be held accountable for their decisions.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>2060 Local Government (Amd’t) (No. 2) Bill 2023 21 st Nov., 2023 The holding of Local Government Elections is a manifestation of democracy at the grassroot level, which will offer an avenue for heightened civic participation. This, in turn, fosters a stronger civic culture and empowers our citizens to engage in governance and decision-making. In alignment with the Coalition Government’s commitment to conduct Local Government Elections in 2024, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to allow for the execution of Local Government Elections to address related matters. Consultations were held on the Bill, and based on the outcome of these consultations, the Bill is now being introduced in Parliament. From 11 th September this year, consultations were held within internal stakeholders, which included the Electoral Commission, Fijian Elections Office, Chief Executive Officers of Municipal Councils, Special Administrators, political parties, members of the media, Civil Society Organisations and diplomatic and development partners. From 15 th September to 14 th October this year, face to face public consultations were held in 13 Municipalities. In addition to these face-to-face consultations, the Bill was also made available on the Ministry’s website, to collect input from those who could not be physically present during the consultations. Lastly, the consultations were held with the following key stakeholders: 1. Office of the Prime Minister; 2. Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning; 3. National Development and Statistics; 4. Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts; and 5. The Office of the Solicitor-General. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are only 16 Clauses of the Bill. As alluded to earlier, the Local Government Elections are of great importance and given its significant public interest and the need to hold the elections at the earliest and most feasible opportunity, I recommend that Parliament considers this Bill without delay and that it be debated upon on Thursday. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, our reason remains the same as to why we are objecting to this Bill, that this Bill has come under Standing Order 51. I have previously listened to what other honourable Members said, that we had done consultation and, therefore, we have brought it here under Standing Order 51. Anyone who has worked previously in Government which I did and I am sure most of you sitting in this Chamber have worked previously under different Ministries and we know the process, even your good self, you had worked under the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. There are two processes involved, first is consultation with the public and second is, once the legislation is drafted, it comes to Parliament and it is the work of the legislature to scrutinise the Bill, take it to the public and then bring it back to Parliament. That is generally the process. However, for the honourable Attorney-General to read out a long list of consultations that he has done, we have not done any consultations on the Bill collectively in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason I am raising this is simply because it was the Opposition then who objected the use of Standing Order 51. They objected, even during election time, they were talking about that, but what do we see? They are using Standing Order 51. What they are saying and what they are doing are two different things. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to do what they told the public that they will be doing and we are here to ensure that these legislations that we want to introduce and pass in this Parliament is done collectively and without the use of Standing Order 51. That is the point we are making, Mr. Speaker,</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2061 Sir, nothing else. Just that particular point that we never said that we will not use it, they said that they will not use Standing Order 51.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- We did not say it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Of course, you have said it so many times. So based on that, we are objecting, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- There being no other speakers, I now offer the floor to the honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mission and vision of the Coalition Government is quite clear. We said it from the beginning that we are going to hold elections and that is what we have done. Subsequent to this, there will be further changes. There is really nothing else to say in relation to Standing Order 51, as you had rightly advised Members of the Opposition, it is a parliamentary process and as Government, we are doing it for good reasons. Question put. Votes cast: - 28 Ayes - 22 Noes Not voted - 4 Motion agreed to.</p></body>
