<body><h3>2024 PARLIAMENT SITTINGS CALENDAR</h3><h4>2024 PARLIAMENT SITTINGS CALENDAR</h4><p>Official Opening of Parliament March April May June July Monday 4 th Monday 11 th – Friday 15 th Parliament Sitting Monday 15 th – Friday 19 th Parliament Sitting Monday 20 th – Friday 24 th Parliament Sitting Monday 28 th Budget Address Monday 8 th – Friday 12 th Budget Debate Monday 15 th – Friday 19 th Monday 5 th – Friday 9 th August September/October Monday 2 nd – Friday 6 th Monday 30 th – Friday 4 th Monday 18 th – Friday 22 nd Parliament Sitting Parliament Sitting Parliament Sitting November Sir, we need to endorse the Sitting Calendar. It will allow all the six Standing Committees to continue with Committee work on the Annual Reports that are currently pending with the Committees and Bills that may be moved in Parliament for consideration. Honourable Members, I request you to support this proposed Sitting Calendar as it is envisaged that there will be more time for debate on matters before Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also pertinent to note that Committees are essential mechanisms which Parliament can reach out to members of the public. Committees are essential in terms of accountability and scrutiny and, therefore, it is vital to allow them time to undertake their work as we had done when we were in the Opposition. With the proposed calendar, the Government will continue to be able to execute and implement its plans and policies and programmes whilst Parliamentary Standing Committees undertake and discharge their functions as mandated in the Standing Orders. In that respect, Sir, the proposed Sitting Calendar before Parliament needs all our support as it would greatly ensure that the Fijian Parliament will continue to undertake its legislative representative and oversight functions. Sir, I do commend this motion to Parliament, and I hereby seek the support of Parliament and all honourable Members to approve the proposed Sitting Calendar for the year 2024. Sir, I thank you for your indulgence. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity. I take this opportunity to also convey our best wishes to our athletes who are in the 17 th Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands. We wish the management and all the athletes the very best and we hope that they will bring in more golds to add to the past achievements of our athletes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the motion by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, I thank him for all the good words that he has used in order to gain the confidence and the trust of this side of Parliament. Let me assure the honourable Leader of the Government and the honourable Prime Minister and Government that we have no objections to the Sitting Calendar before us for 2024. But again, as we have raised in the Business Committee, Sir, let us hope that the Government will commit to this Sitting Calendar. We have flexibility as well and we understand the engagements</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>2010 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 21 st Nov., 2023 that Government need to undertake but let us not forget the fact that we also have a responsibility to our people and that is something that we need to continually highlight. Sir, 2023, I think in the record of Fiji Parliament, is the worst year in terms of Parliament Sitting. HON. K. K. LAL.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, 2023, on record is the worst for Parliament in terms of the number of sittings… HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER. - Order! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- If we are unable to meet rather than totally cancelling the schedule, it can be re-scheduled.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> You have made your point, move on.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> That is exactly the point, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>The problem is, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and all the Ministers are undertaking too many ministerial travels. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I know for a fact, Mr. Speake, Sir, in the previous government, it is the directive of the honourable Prime Minister, whenever there is Parliament sitting, cancel all your overseas commitments. Parliament is important. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS. - Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- And that is what we are pleading with Government. We are flexible, we have served in government, but we have a responsibility to the Fijian people as well and that is why this institution is so important. We need to scrutinise, we need to look at ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. - This is working much better now:</span></p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Well, that is what you are saying.</p><p>We have taken away the number of sittings, we have reduced the debate timings and number of speakers. We have a responsibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have stated, we have already served in government, but I urge on the Government, please make a commitment on our national priorities because we all have a responsibility to serve our people and serve them better. We support this but we will continue to raise our concerns particularly given the record that we have in this year’s sitting, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We support the motion, but I hope that Government will take our concern seriously.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 2011 MR. SPEAKER. - I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply. HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I am thankful that the honourable Members have been persuaded by what I have presented and are in support of the motion before us. Various points raised regarding flexibility, yes, definitely we take into account. Some of the comments in terms of our planning have been taken into account in this calendar and, of course, as experienced by the last Government, there are always issues which come up as we move in the year. As experienced by them, they have also exercised that throughout their term of Government. There was also a comment made on overseas travel. Again, as I had mentioned, the calendar before us has taken into account some of the regular international commitments. The point regarding the scrutiny role of Parliament, we all know the experience of the Opposition in the last few years during the FijiFirst Government in terms the suppression of the Opposition … (Chorus of interjections) HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- … which has been ongoing for over several years, despite some of the justification we brought up. It is not a matter of, as they are mentioning that we are taking revenge, no it is not that. We have move up another level in terms of allowing for Opposition accountability, not only in the Committees but also in what we as a Coalition Government stand for, which is an open and transparent government. Of course, they mentioned the number of speakers, the way we put in motions and how it has been programmed, they have broken the record in terms of Standing Order 51. The numbers are already there in public, but we will never … (Chorus of interjections) HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- … reach that record in terms of the abuse of Standing Order 51. I end by thanking the Opposition and those in the Business Committee for supporting the calendar in front of us. You should be ashamed, why have you been missing from Parliament? For 16 years we have been supressed but now we are free. (Laughter) Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Just a comment on the calendar, honourable Members, we are almost completing one year of governance by the Coalition Government. It has not been an easy journey, quite a trying one, as the Government is trying all its best to govern. So, the calendar has been affected one way or another because as they try to forge ahead, they try as well not to be restrictive in the way they do things. Hopefully, with all the comments that have now been passed regarding this new calendar, I hope that that should be able to send a strong message to Government that we will try our best to make these little changes as possible to the agreed calendar that we have now approved.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>2012</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>21 st Nov., 2023 All I want to say is, it is not easy being in the Chair and to go through all these with changes. Perhaps, it is a new ship, trying out its best to trial the seas, the different weather and all that goes with it in sailing a boat and by sailing a boat, it will be remiss of me not to mention the presence in the gallery of the former Assistant Minister for Health, Mr. O’Connor. He is a former navy man and he fully understands what we are talking about when we are talking about weather in the seas. Welcome to Parliament, Mr. O’Connor.</p></body>
