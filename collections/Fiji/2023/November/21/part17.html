<body><h3>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><p>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 HON. S. D. TURAGA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the – (a) Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 28/2023), be (b) (c) (d) considered by Parliament without delay. Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd November, 2023 but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 and why Parliament must consider it without delay. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 was introduced to provide for the restructuring of the Mahogany Industry in Fiji for the purpose of facilitating its further development, having regard to the interest of indigenous landowners and the people of Fiji generally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be an understatement to state the importance of Fiji’s Mahogany Industry, however, one cannot deny that this industry requires specific knowledge and technical skillset for its sustainable development. For this reason, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to transfer the overall responsibility of the Act and by extension, the regulating of the Mahogany Industry from the Office of the Prime Minister to the Ministry of Forestry, which will be able to provide the much- needed technical expertise, advice and guidance in the Mahogany Industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act repealed by the Fiji Mahogany Act of 2003 and transferred oversight of the Mahogany Industry from the Ministry of Forestry to the Office of the Prime Minister through the establishment of a Mahogany Industry Council wherein the Prime Minister is appointed as the chairperson.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>2058 Mahogany Industry Development (Amd’t) Bill 2023 21 st Nov., 2023 The Bill, therefore, is really just an avenue for the reinstatement of what was previously the status quo. There have been consultations on the 16 th of June, 2023 conducted by the Office of the Prime Minister with the Ministry of Forestry; the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics; Ministry of Public Enterprises; the Office of the Solicitor-General; Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited; Ministry of Fisheries and the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises. Therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that Parliament considers the Bill without delay and that it be debated upon on Thursday, to allow the Ministry of Forestry to be the appropriate custodian that would assume responsibility of the Act, to begin with. MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion and at the end, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, I come to assist the honourable Member and maybe that will mean a change of heart with the other side of Parliament. We oppose this Sir, again, on the use of Standing Order 51. I have one major concern. The honourable Attorney-General did state about the need for this Bill and the simple reason behind it was the reinstatement of the status quo. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have progressed a lot since the inception of these Acts. Time has changed and that is why we object to the use of Standing Order 51. I have had one observation that I wish to state in front of Government this afternoon. Initially, when we debated the President’s Address, most of the statements that were coming from this side of Parliament, we stated that this is where we have left off and hope that you will take it from there. However, I have noted that instead of where we left off, they are going back to 1997 where they left off and then trying to bring in these changes, so it is the context. That is why we objected to Standing Order 51 because I, at some stage, served under the Fiji Mahogany Board under Mr. Winston Thompson and Mr. Uday Sen. I was given the Chairmanship for about a year before the Mahogany Decree came into place, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Again, this is critical. We have just had some discussions about the pine industry business, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is not that we want to deny landowners the opportunity but, again, from the transition from Forestry into Fiji Hardwood and the problems that they faced and the need for this, that is why the role of the Committee is so important to look into the issue. That is why we are not just objecting for the sake of objecting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are better ways to do this, particularly given the importance of this industry and how it can contribute to Fiji’s economic progress, development, employment opportunities, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we really need to seriously look at some of these issues, not just reinstating the status quo for the sake of doing it but within the context of the time that we are in, the history, the changes and the challenges that it went through and use this Parliament to bring better alternatives and look at things, scrutinise them well so that we can be in a better position to make some informed decisions and bring the best legislation that will not only meet the needs for today but most importantly, for the future as well. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the comments from the honourable Leader of the Opposition, it is a cosmetic change. Once it is reverted to Forestry, there will be significant review that will go through the Committee stage. We want it to go to Forestry and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would probably understand more. The honourable Minister has a lot of things on his plate, that is why it must be engineered by</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Local Government (Amd’t) (No. 2) Bill 2023 2059 the Ministry of Forestry. That is the very reason we bring it under Standing Order 51. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast: Ayes Noes Not voted - - 27 - 22 5 Motion agreed to.</p></body>
