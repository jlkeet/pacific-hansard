<body><h3>EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 27/2023), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or another Committee of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd November, 2023, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Employment Relations Act 2007 has been the focus of considerable Government, social partner and International Labour Organization (ILO) interest over several years because of amendments to the Act from 2011 onwards, which did not</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>2054 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 21 st Nov., 2023 comply with fundamental ILO Conventions, including the: • • • Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948; Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention 1949; and Abolition of Forced Labour Convention 1957. The motion is for this august Parliament to consider the Bill, to amend the definition of “essential service and industry” (particularly section 185 of the Act) without delay, which is necessary in order to restore the rights of workers and unions’ right and to bring Fiji’s employment legislation in compliance with international labour standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is under increased pressure, including at the ILO Conference 2022 and this year, to bring its employment legislation in compliance with the fundamental ILO Conventions that it has ratified, including the International Labour Organization’s Freedom of Association and the protection of the right to organise a convention. There has been widespread criticism over the past decade, both in Fiji and internationally, in relation to other amendments in the Act in 2011, 2013 and 2015, which dramatically increased the scope and number of industries that are defined as essential services and industries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially when the Act was promulgated in 2007, there were 16 services listed as essential services in Schedule 7 of the Act. Following the amendment over the past 12 years, there are a number of entities that are now considered essential services and industries, including Government workers, all statutory and local authorities in Fiji and all public enterprises. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s current list of essential services includes industries, like the finance industry and pine and mahogany industry, that fall outside of the definition of essential services. The effect of Fiji’s wide definition of essential services means that under Part 19 of the Act. workers and unions’ right to strike and right to free assembly and free speech are severely curtailed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Government had also signed the Joint Implementation Report and the Tripartite Agreement on 29 th June, 2016, which effectively closed the case under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution which may have led to the Commission of Inquiry for Fiji. The Coalition Government has reconstituted the Employment Relations Advisory Board (ERAB) and ILO Convention 144 and has brought the tripartite parties together for a genuine dialogue with a commitment to review and amend the ERA. Over the past 10 years, ILO has repeatedly called on Fiji to review its list of essential services so as to restrict limitations on the right to strike and to essential services in the strict sense of the term. The ILO supervisory bodies have indicated that Fiji’s original list of essential services in Schedule 7 contains an appropriate list of resource service, and the effect of the proposed amendment to section 185 is to revert to the original list of essential services in Schedule 7. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment is an important first step and Fiji in taking action is to show its commitment to bring Fiji’s employment laws in compliant with International Labour Standards, in order to promote decent work and recognise the rights of both, employers and workers, who are the lifeblood of our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must emphasise that the urgency is underscored by the need to uphold the right to assembly, organisation and free speech. This, Sir, is one of the many longstanding non- compliance issue with international labour standards and safeguards. There have been wider consultations, and I, therefore, endorse the Bill.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 2055 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again on behalf of this side of Parliament do not agree with this notion that this should be discussed using Standing Order 51. The honourable Attorney-General needs to know that Fiji is not the only country in the world that has not fully ratified all the ILO Labour Conventions. Some of the biggest countries and richest countries have not done that. They look at what is necessary for their country. The group that is now in Government have always portrayed themselves as the bastions of democracy. We have talked about the importance of this Chamber and for us as the representatives of the people to discuss these things. Just because someone says it, it does not mean that you automatically do it. Those large countries that you are talking about, not all of them have signed on to all of these fundamental ILO Conventions, not all of them. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- So what? HON. J. USAMATE.- They have not signed the ones they are pushing to do and they have not signed themselves and you are saying just because they say ‘we should do this’ we should automatically do it. Why do you not bring it to this Chamber? Let the Committees go through it. Let us discuss it. You talked to yourselves about the passion and democracy, but you are suppressing democracy. The representatives of the people are here. Why are you always going to Standing Order 51? Now you are not acting just like it, well you are not hypocrites, but when you do things and then you suppress the opportunity for us to debate it, let us debate it in Parliament. Let it go through the whole system with the Committees. Just because someone say something you just want to bow down to them. Stop it. Stand on your two feet. Let us discuss it here. Let it go through the process and do the right thing. We object to this going through Standing Order 51. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is precisely what I am going to speak on Standing Order 51. Honourable Usamate is showing the height of hypocrisy. He is talking about hypocrites, but the height of hypocrisy is coming from the other side. This is a legislation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Attorney-General very carefully explained that this is the Government that is correcting the fundamentals of democracy that was destroyed by those sitting on the other side. After the 2006 coup in 2007, the first attempt and those who were part of that became part of the FijiFirst Government, continued in 2015. Even in Parliament, they passed the legislation to further curtail the rights of the workers. So, Standing Order 51, Mr. Speaker, was used by those who are sitting on the other side now, to do that. This is essentially a process where the Employment Relations Advisory Board (ERAB) was re-established …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- You are the one complaining the most:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … where the employers have come together, where they have all agreed and they all see that this is an urgent Bill to be passed because the consultation with those that mattered had already taken place.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>2056 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 21 st Nov., 2023 On Thursday, they will have the right opportunity and so for him to come out and say, you know we are not practising democracy and somehow, we are overriding Parliament, I mean, there is a lot of hogwash. (Laughter) Coming from the honourable Member who blames everyone else about hogwash but the biggest hogwash comes from him. The demonstration of the biggest hypocrisy comes from him because he was the Minister for Employment. In 2015, we brought further restrictions, so Standing Order 51 is the right thing to do. Let us pass this on Thursday and restore the rights of the workers. I support the Bill, thank you. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to contribute to this motion and against the Standing Order 51 being used. On 16 th September, 2017, if I can just read to you what was reported, it says in the Fiji Times, and I quote: “National Federation Party Leader Professor Biman Prasad yesterday Parliament that rushing important Bills under Standing Order 51 was inappropriate.” told That was what he said. Professor Prasad said this after the Government fast-tracked three Bills and three motions for Government guarantees. On a point of order, he said the Opposition should be given a few days to prepare a comprehensive response to the motions. This is what he said, Mr. Speaker Sir, “It makes sense to get the Bills in our hands for a few days before we can make meaningful contributions,” Hypocrisy - that is what we are saying, Mr. Speaker. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.– Order! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- That is why we are saying, that is hypocrisy. Try and stop using Standing Order 51 and let Legislature do its work and take this out to the people. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Naupoto and Honourable Members, I have indicated several times in the past, Standing Orders 51 is a Parliamentary process. That is available for us to utilise and the Government, for this matter is now utilising Standing Orders 51 as previous Governments have done in the past. Previous Governments have done it in the past. They have gone under 51 to work on the Parliamentary process that is available to bring into the Parliament at the earliest time possible, the motion that is being followed here, so the motion that we have before us, is on 51. I now call on the Honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If I can recall clearly, a term that I used during my Maiden Speech was “restoration”. That is basically what we have done here. We are going back to where it was before, so that it is acceptable to the whole world. That is why it needs to be</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>21 st Nov., 2023 Mahogany Industry Development (Amd’t) Bill 2023 2057 debated expeditiously. I endorse the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast: - 28 Ayes - 21 Noes Not Voted - 5 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER. We shall continue, and I now call upon the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, the honourable Siromi Turaga to move his third motion.</p></body>
