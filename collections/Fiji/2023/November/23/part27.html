<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>Minister for Education (Hon. A. M. Radrodro) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><h4>Discussions below are in two parts, to address the questions posed by the honourable Assistant</h4><p>Minister for Education, honourable I. Vanawalu. (a) Introduction of Programme - 2014 The Fiji National University, Collee of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, started the Bachelor of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry (BVSc &amp; AH) in 2014, with more than 40 students. The Programme runs for 5½ years, including 6 months of hands-on internship. Only 10 students graduated from the first cohort in 2019. To-date, 66 students have graduated from the University since 2019 – 4 of these graduates are from other countries in the South Pacific. Currently, there are 9 students enrolled in this Programme and they are in the fourth year of the Course and will complete and graduate in 2025. The FNU may close this Programme in 2025. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and FNU The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for registering Veterinary doctors to practise in Fiji. The Ministry and the FNU are closely working together to assist with the registration of the Veterinary Science graduates. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has also assisted in funding further training to get the first three cohorts of graduates ready for a qualifying examination that will be developed and administered by the MOA. The training, which is conducted in three phases, started in 2022, and 44 students were part of it. The third phase, a hands-on programme of 12 weeks ended recently on 4 th November, 2023 and that was completed by nine students. The remaining graduates could not attend those trainings due to employment and personal commitments. The University plans to work closely with WOAH and MoA to offer continuous professional development trainings for FNU graduates and other Vets who may need such training. The lack of a Veterinary Council in Fiji is a major setback since a council could have managed most of the post-graduation events that FNU is currently involved in, including continuous professional development. Such a council will also bring all the stakeholders together to manage veterinary practice and report to the MoA.</p><p>iv. We believe that the registration of FNU Vets will greatly reduce the current shortage of Vets in Fiji and the South Pacific. More Vets are needed not only to fill vacancies, but new Vets can stimulate the setup of more commercial livestock operations. (b) Furthermore, in response to the second part of the question, the table given below provides the data on the graduates’ employment status in the workforce, despite the challenges encountered in this specific area. Below is the breakdown of the employment engagement of the 66 graduates to-date.
