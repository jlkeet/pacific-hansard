<body><h3>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023</h3><h4>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 21st November 2023, I move: That the Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill of 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 21 st November 2023. The Local Government (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Local Government Act of 1972, to ensure that the Local Government election procedures and processes are consistent with the policies and legislations relevant to elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin with the quote by Abraham Lincoln: “Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Live with that now, live it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> For there to be a true democracy in our country, we must give our people the opportunity to be involved in what is happening in their towns and cities. Citizen participation is a building block of democracy. As I had mentioned on Tuesday, people at the very level of society - nation, provincial, district, city, town and village must be empowered for governance to be fully responsive and represented. Mr. Speaker, Sir, holding the municipal elections will enhance the role of the civil society and improve the quality of life at grassroot level. It will nurture our future leaders, empower citizens to speak on the issues that are unique to different towns and cities, and it will bring to light key issues which need to be addressed by the Government. We do not always need to have surveys and studies done to find out what our people need, we can give them an opportunity to tell us directly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a priority of the Coalition Government to address the wastage of resources and taxpayer’s money that has taken place in the previous years. If we provide a platform which people can use to advocate for issues that affect them, we will be able to better allocate resources and taxpayers’ money. Furthermore, by encouraging democratic local governance, there will be positive effects on our societies. It will encourage public discussions and involvement, participation in decision making, there will be greater focus on vulnerable groups and the environment. The development of our society</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>2266 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 deserves the same amount of attention that is given to economic development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we strongly believe in listening to our people, and bringing back municipal elections is a step in the right direction. As mentioned on Tuesday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, public consultation was held on the Bill and based on the outcome of this consultation, the Bill is now being introduced in Parliament. There were consultations with key stakeholders, the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts, and of course, the Office of the Solicitor-General. Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, the amending legislation will come into force on a date or date(s) appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. Clause 2 of the Bill provides for the definition of the term used throughout the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 9 of the Act to include that the Electoral Commission consults the Minister to determine the number of councillors in each ward. Clause 4 of the Bill deletes section 9A of the Act as Special Administrators to remove the provision for special administrators. Clause 5 of the Bill deletes with section 10 of the Act and substitutes a new section which provides the manner in which a candidate can stand for election to the Council, and the qualifications required. It also inserts a new section 10A which provides for the provisions relating to the disqualification of a candidate after he or she has been nominated for election. Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 11 of the Act to provide for the qualification of voters. Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 12 of the Act to delete the term “elector” and substitute with the term “voter”. Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 13 of the Act to allow for the Minister responsible for elections to make regulations in relations to the conduct of elections. Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 14 of the Act to provide that Parliament will allocate financial resources to the Fijian Elections Office for the conduct of a local government elections. Clause 10 of the Bill inserts section 15A to provide for the vacancy of a seat of a councillor. Clause 11 of the Bill deletes section 16A of the Act. Clause 12 of the Bill amends section 21 to amend the method used to determine the outcome when there is a draw in votes. Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 23 to amend the method used to determine the outcome when there is a draw in votes. Clause 14 of the Bill amends section 25(1) of the Act to replace “town clerk” with “Chief Executive Officer”. Clause 15 of the Bill provides the transitional provisions.</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 2267 Clause 16 revokes the Local Government (Election) Regulations of 1972. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable members, the floor is now open for debate, and I have before me a list of four names, two from each side provided by the Whips and the batting will be led off by: 1. Honourable P. D. Kumar; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 3. Honourable P. K. Bala; and 4. Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the world is moving with time, this Government is stuck in the past. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What I call a colonial hangover:</span> They need to overcome that, Mr.</p><p>Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Nonsense:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, words ...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Hogwash! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- …were created during the Colonial days for rubbish collection. The Bill before us is taking us backwards. Why can we not use the municipality boundary for each council or town as one single electoral boundary rather than dividing into wards and little pieces. There is merit in moving away from wards to a single electoral boundary, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A single electoral boundary can encourage elected officials or councillors to consider the interest of the entire community residing in that municipality rather than advocating the interest of their specific wards at the expense of the broader community. A single boundary can contribute to better distribution and policy development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, including comprehensive, urban planning and sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unified approach will allow the growth of the municipality and it will reduce the complexity of managing a municipality. A unified approach is very much in line with our National Electoral System. Single electoral boundary was already practiced by the three Municipal Councils in the past. These Municipalities operated with no ward. In 2007, we saw how Municipal Councils operated where the number of councillors did not match the number of wards. For example, Suva City Council had five wards with 20 Councillors while Lami had 12 Counsellors with two wards. How far is Lami from Suva City Council? Should Lami be amalgamated with Suva? Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nausori Town Council had 12 Councillors overseeing over 46,000 people. Labasa had 12 Councillors for its only 27,000 people and Tavua which is basically penniless, had nine Councillors to represent 2,500 citizens. The total number of elected councillors in 30 Municipal Councils were 159 - bigger than the Parliament of Fiji.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>2268 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 Ministries, statutory bodies provide majority of the services whether it is education, health or a transport system, et cetera. What services do Municipal Councils provide? Garbage collection and drain cleaning. Even roads are taken away. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want, and I urge the other side to think properly of how the Municipalities are evolving over time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister whether the boundary extension exercise by the Municipal Councils is complete, which was being undertaken under the guidance of the Local Government Committee? Areas outside municipal boundaries have become satellite towns, but it is not part of the municipality. A good example is Cuvu, which is not part of Sigatoka. Have you look at all that? How will the boundary and city councils treat Rural Local Authority? Mr. Speaker, Sir, have we incorporated Rural Local Authority boundaries and are they going to be part of the voting system or the election that the Government is talking about? We are not too far away from New Zealand, the least they can do (they often travel to New Zealand) is learn from New Zealand on how they have progressed with the election system, as well as developing its municipality. It is extremely important to note that Auckland Council, in 2010, was established by dissolving four City Councils and three District Councils. Why was that done? It was done to reduce the administrative cost and to focus on the development of a unified city for better planning and development, and above all, pooling resources to provide those services in a more structured manner. So, look at Auckland Council at this stage. If you look at the population of Fiji, it is just less than one million and we have 13 municipal councils. They are councils which are very small like Tavua and Rakiraki. That is why we had appointed a single CEO to look after both the municipalities, because the intention was to amalgamate them. It was not making sense. If you have these counsellors, there is an overhead cost in running the municipality, and what we wanted was more resources to go into developing the place rather than simply money being wasted in the overhead cost.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You had been in a dictatorship:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> It is not dictatorship, thank you, it is about modernising the municipality. That is why we are saying, they live in the past. That is what they know, that is what has been left by our colonial governance. That is what they left, and that is what they are continuing with. They are not moving with time, and that is the sad part of this Coalition Government. What they know is where they left, the clock stopped there. When they came back, now they want to go back to that time piece. That is what they are doing, they are not moving with time. We are simply urging for the interest of the ratepayers. (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- No, democracy is not, that we never said there will be no election, thank you. It was all about making sure that we are able to come up with better reforms. For the reforms, let me just remind them to go back and read the Daily Hansard (if you really want to know), where I delivered the Ministerial Statement, and the work had already progressed in that direction. We had completed the review of the Town Planning Act, we had completed the review of the Subdivision Act and the honourable Minister, if he is honest enough, should admit that even the terms of reference was developed for us to go in this direction. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Bill to</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 2269 amend the Local Government Act. The Bill before Parliament is about restoring basic democracy to all the 13 municipal councils. As the Minister for Housing and Local Government, this Bill holds more than initiative certificates. It represents a profound commitment to our nation and our people. The proposed amendment aims to pave the way for a fair and inclusive Local Government Election, a cornerstone of our democratic values. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for long 18 years, the ratepayers and residents of 13 municipalities had been deprived of the basic democratic right to elect their representatives in the administration of their councils. It is far, far too long. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to underscore the dedication of our Coalition Government to the principles of democracy and the empowerment of our citizens. We firmly believe that the power to elect representatives should rest in the hands of the very individuals residing in the municipalities and communities. Furthermore, our Coalition Government has fulfilled its promises to the people in reinstating the Local Government Elections. The Bill present before the august Parliament, stands as a compelling pathway to a fair and just Local Government Election. The coming Local Government Election symbolises this commitment and we are resilient in ensuring a transparent and fair electoral process. The Bill presented before this august Parliament today, sets the wheels in motion for an election that echoes the democratic aspirations of our people. The Local Government Election stands, not just as a democratic exercise but as a beacon of hope for our communities, potential catalysts for significant positive change. the decisions made at the local level resonates directly in the daily lives of our citizens impacting their livelihood enforcing grassroot economic development. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the proposed amendments to the Local Government Act aims at modernising and improving the legislative framework aligning it with international best practices. These changes born out of extensive consultations with residents, stakeholders, political parties, media and civil society organisation and reflect our dedication embracing the democratic levels ideals of participation and inclusiveness. The prolonged absence of elected councillors over the past 15 years has impacted the functions of the councils. Create independencies on national budget for project and operations. With this amendment we aim to break three from this side, Mr. Speaker, returning decision making power to the rightfully representatives chosen by the people. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Councils become complacent to collect rates. Today we have a huge arrears problem. The last Council Elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was held in 2005. The Councillors term expiring in 2008. From 2009 all Councils have been managed under the supervision of Special Administrators by virtue of section 9 of the Local Government Act which we are revoking through this amendment. The last 18 years have created spiral events that have completely eroded the essence of democratic decision-making in Councils which will change for the better. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had the privilege of participating in extensive consultations where residents actively contributed to the manual process. Their passion and enthusiasm reaffirm the importance of giving them a voice in local governance decisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, these amendments are not just legal adjustments, they are a commitment to restoring democratic decision-making at the Council level. The Coalition Government firmly believes that this Election will charter the course towards a bright future and that</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>2270 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 the voice of people are not just heard but truly listened to. I express my gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to this Bill and I fully support the Bill. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one has to be able to put with all the heat that comes to you. So, I hope honourable Kamikamica will take note of this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last speaker said that we have waited for 16 years and now we will have the …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Get your facts right:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> …Municipal Elections I want to ask the honourable Attorney-General why you have sidelined the mataqali from Municipal Elections. (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. K. BALA.- I want to ask the honourable Attorney-General. Why you have sidelined the mataqali from the operations of Municipal Council.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- You need to answer this:</span> You people are coming here shouting, dancing, everything for the iTaukei and here in this amendment, you people have taken their rights away. (Chorus of interjections) HON. K. K. LAL.- Shame! HON. P. K. BALA.- Do not laugh. It is not a laughing matter. I am asking you. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute to the motion that is before us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment will take away my rights as well.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> … to contest the municipal election if this amendment is passed. You know nothing and that is why you are saying all sorts of things. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two sides of the coin, looks like they have only seen one side of the coin and that is to deprive our rights as the ratepayer of respective municipalities. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Ahre! HON. P. K. BALA.- What do you mean ahre, Members of Parliament are not allowed? I think you have not read, that could be one reason. The other reason could be, you have not discussed in the Cabinet that is why you are not aware. (Laughter)</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 2271 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendment to section 9(2) seems not necessary as the Local Government Election Regulation section 2 that the election commission shall consult the Minister for such purposes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Local Government Act (Amendment) Bill propose that section 9(3) of the Act be amended by inserting</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.:</span> The obvious correction in 2014.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- I think he want something from me:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- That the councillors shall hold office MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please keep that to yourself. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> But privately, I will share with you Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Local Government Act (Amendment) Bill proposes that section 9(3) of the Act be (Honourable Members interject) HON. P. K. BALA.- It is my humble plea that after the session call me in your office and talk to you, please. That is my plea.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Plagiarism Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> The Local Government (Amendment) Bill proposes that section 9(3) of the Act be amended by inserting: “That the councillors shall hold office for a period of three years so such terms and condition as the Minister may deem fit.” All these years, they come here and harping on that the Ministers are controlling all the municipalities. (Honourable Members interject) HON. P. K. BALA.- I do not want to talk to you, you are useless. This defeats the whole.…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Check the Hansard:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- You are useless. Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this defeats the whole purpose of holding elections as elected councillors shall be working on the terms of the Minister. The Local Government Act (these people must know) is the framework of operation and now under this amendment, the Minister will have legal powers to dictate to the Council, where is the autonomy that you all have been harping about? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment to section 9(a) is not necessary as it has nothing to do with calling municipal elections. Furthermore, the replacement of section 10 through deleting and inserting needs further attention. Section 10(1) states that a candidate shall be nominated by a party to stand as an independent seems not necessary. In prior elections, through the regulations,</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>2272 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 candidates have used political party symbols or independent symbols and, in this amendment, the ratepayers’ association or the landowner and citizen association are being denied of their rights. They cannot form landowners’ association or ratepayers’ association. These are all his doing – being denied of their right Mr. Speaker, Sir. In previous elections Mr. Speaker, Sir, the landowners used to have their own candidates in their respective municipalities. Let me repeat, reminded by my colleague here that in previous elections, the landowners used to have their own candidates in their respective municipalities. This message is very clear to the mataqalis that this Government has removed their rights. (Honourable Members interject) Mr. Speaker, Sir, in some districts, the ratepayers do not want politics and they have the freedom to appoint or sponsor their candidates, and Councils like Tavua, Savusavu, these people, they never had this politics. They had the association, you should have consulted me, that is the problem. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You did not win the Election:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- The qualifications of candidates standing requires review. The removal of the Members of Parliament is not in the interest of democracy:</span> The Drafting team should have referred to the High Court Judgement of 17(2005), and 10.10 of 1997. Section 10(3) states “that the total of the number of candidates nominated by a Political Party, to number equally, to the ward. The number also requires a review, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Political Parties shall be allowed to fill candidates to the number that they feel fit and proper, and then there should be a provision for dummy candidates. Those were all past practice. They removed all those things, … MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member.. HON. P. K. BALA.- …and provision to withdraw… MR. SPEAKER.- The bell has rung. (Laughter) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was hoping to give a speech, or give my response to inspire, but I have to respond to some of the mud that has been thrown from the other side. Let me just remind, honourable Bala. Honourable Kumar said, “go back and read the Daily Hansard”, we did. Honourable Bala, in 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir… HON. P. K. BALA.- Areh, what about the … HON. L.

(Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- They just cannot deal with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Under the Special Administrators, let us just go back in time, since honourable Kumar is accusing us of going back in time, let us go back in time. Under Special Administrators, Shirley Park was giving to P Meghji. JC’s Park was given to North Pole Hotel.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Part of Churchill Park was given to Tappoos:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The honourable Minister is misleading this Parliament. She said, “that Lautoka City Council gave away Shirley Park to P Meghji. There was a process. Not aye! (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- There was a process and they were the successful bidder, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, they did not consult the voters or the ratepayers of Lautoka Council. (Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- You did not consult the ratepayers. That is the difference. The difference between that side and this side. We will now have the ratepayers vote for their leaders and make decisions in the Council. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- That is why you are being put there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D.

L.D. TABUYA.:</span> Took too long, and cost too much.</p><p>(Laughter) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- That, we have to pick up. Govind Park, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rest my case. (Laughter) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the point we are making here, it is the need for ratepayers to determine. In all modern democracies, they have Local Government Elections. Talking about modernisation or coming into the 21 st century, they are electing their leaders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will get now to what I really wanted to share, and that is the importance of women participating in Local Government Elections. It is not just a matter of gender equality, it is about enriching the equality of our democracy. I am very honoured to be part of Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians, which comprises of…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Please, remove you from there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> Listen! … women Members of Parliament in this Chamber who are dedicated and committed to increasing the participation of women in the Local Government Elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite all political parties, please, ensure that you remove the barriers for women candidates to participate in the Local Government Elections. You have your voluntary quota system, constitutions, some 20 percent, some 30 percent, and some do not have it, but please, do encourage your women to step up. I call on all our fellow Fijians, please embrace the importance of women’s leadership, and the need for us to stand up in support of gender equality. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Fiji Country Gender Assessment, it presents a compelling reality. Sir, 81 percent of Fijians agree that women are underrepresented in our nation. Furthermore, a remarkable 72 percent of Fijians believe it would be better for our country if there were more women in leadership roles and actively contributing to decision making processes across politics and governance. Our Ministry is collaborating with the Ministry for Local Government, and I thank the honourable Minister for the work we are doing together and that we are engaging our relevant stakeholders, civil society organisations and we are hoping to foster an enabling environment for women’s active political participation in the Local Government Elections. I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, honourable Sashi Kiran who is already working in communities with the Republican Institute (RI) funded by USAID, already engaging our women on local level to participate in Local Government Elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are really excited about having our women participate in Local Government Elections. It is my plea to all Fijian women, please, step up and engage in Local Government Elections. We are usually the ones that when we go around to the communities, they appeal in these meetings about road humps on roads that where speeding is happening too often, the need for streetlights and footpaths and the need for improved crossings, and also to keep their children</p><div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div><p>2276 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 and family safe and the need for more bus shelters. These are issues that women usually raise in the communities, and we have got to listen to them and help them to step up and become leaders in their municipalities. I am really disappointed with the noise coming from the other side, that they are not showing respect for the appeal to women. Come on, show your respect for the appeal for women. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it behoves me that the honourable Minister of no election had the audacity… (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.-...to come and ask things that are already in the Act. That is why it is so dangerous, when you try to read the law when you are not a lawyer. Let me go to section 125 of the Local Government Act, which includes villages. The villages that are located in the municipalities can participate. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- It is the village.… (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- You can hold the book but you may not know what is inside:</span></p><p>(Laughter) If may, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the village under the iTaukei Affairs Board that can participate.

Honourable Kumar was referring to going back. They must go, according to the statistics. The problem is, because previously during honourable Bala’s time, they formed into groups only to prepare for the Local Government. After the Local Government’s done, there is nothing there. Now there are standards, they have to comply. They must come through by way of political parties.
