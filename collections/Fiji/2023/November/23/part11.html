<body><h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3><h4>POINT OF ORDER</h4><p>Unparliamentary Language – Hon. Professor B. C. Prasad HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I rise again on a Point of Order? I refer to Standing Order 74(1) and Standing Order 45(4)(b)(c) because you were going to make your ruling on the Point of Order that I had raised yesterday. I kindly request your high office to also make a ruling on the Point of Order that I raised on the sitting on 15 th September, 2023. If you would recall, there was an End of Week Statement by the honourable Rinesh Sharma on the increase of National Minimum Wage and I objected to the statement made by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics in his response to the End of Week Statement. This is what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister stated, Sir, and I quote from Page 1927 of the Daily Hansard of Friday, 15 th September, 2023: “Mr. Speaker, they looted the workers by forcing them to use their FNPF funds during the pandemic.” Mr. Speaker, in yesterday's deliberation, the honourable Member, again, used these words against this side of Parliament. What is the reason behind it? I really do not know whether we can look at Standing Order 45(4)(b)(c) but, again, I did raise my concern if it could be registered and I requested a ruling from you, Sir. I hope that this will be provided tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have given him the opportunity to respond. Again, let me say that in his reply, he stated, and I quote: “They looted the workers by forcing them to use their FNPF funds during the pandemic”, but his response was totally different when you gave him the opportunity and this is what he said, and I quote from Page 1935 of the Daily Hansard of Friday, 15 th September, 2023: “All I said, Mr. Speaker, was in reference to the FNPF Pension Act, that is a fact. That was a Government that made the decision - the Bainimarama Government.” He then continued: “Yes, I used the word “looted”. It was the Bainimarama Government that passed the Decree and terminated the FNPF workers’ contracts and they lost pension and they had no recourse to go back to the court because there was another decree which did not even allow that.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of the word, “looted”, again, is very offensive and I hope and plead with you that the honourable Member needs to be reminded, he needs to be warned, that it is unparliamentary. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my Point of Order and I hope that your ruling on it can also be included in tomorrow’s ruling. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think it is a bit late at this stage that this Point of Order issue is being raised. We are now on Agenda Item 4. During the Confirmation of Minutes, issues such as this or any other you feel ought to be addressed so as not be included or excluded from the Confirmation of the Minutes, that is the time when you raise it.</p><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2191 When I was in Opposition, we usually look at it before the Confirmation of Minutes, that is when we rise on a Point of Order and say, “look before the Minutes is confirmed, this is what transpired and we would like to flag for you, Sir, a Point of Order.” We have been doing it for quite a long time from the Opposition. For this particular case, I cannot make it as an exception because it has gone past the Confirmation of Minutes stage and we are right into Agenda Item 4, but we will take note of what you have highlighted, honourable Leader of the Opposition in the hope for the issue of fairness, that we are able to drum up some search. The Secretariat will require time to look at this. I cannot be including this in tomorrow’s outcome of what I stated yesterday because of the outstanding Point of Orders that were both raised by honourable Sachida Nand and honourable Professor Biman Prasad and yesterday, again, by the honourable Leader of the Opposition as against the Deputy Prime Minister Professor Biman Prasad. So, for this particular one, we will take note of it, but maybe we need to be given time, honourable Leader of the Opposition so that we can check all that is required to be checked so we can come up with a position to advise whether this is what you have asked and this is the outcome of the search that we have undertaken and this is the ruling from the Speaker’s Chair. I hope you understand our situation as well, honourable Leader of the Opposition. We will take note and we will move on. Honourable Members, there will be three Committee Reports for tabling this morning.</p></body>
