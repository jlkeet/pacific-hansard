<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON THE MONITORING OFIMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUGARCANE DEVELOPMENT ANDFARMERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON THE MONITORING OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUGARCANE DEVELOPMENT AND FARMERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Performance Audit on the Monitoring of Implementation of the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance Programme which was tabled on 14 th September, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion to debate the Review of the Performance Audit on the Monitoring of the Implementation of the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance which was tabled in Parliament on 14 th September, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know the background and the objective of the grant which is, that the Government through the Ministry of Sugar should provide annual budgets to various grant programmes to support its objective of a sustainable sugar industry. Additionally, the Government has supported Fiji Sugar Corporation and farmers in an effort to raise cane productions to three million tonnes each year, supposedly from 2023 as per planned back in 2011. We commend the audit work carried out by the Office of the Attorney-General in examining whether the sugarcane development and farm assistance grant that was distributed to farmers for the financial years 2016 and 2019 was effectively and efficiently administered, and if the objectives of the grant were achieved. It was a timely audit. The Committee noted and agreed with the findings during the implementation of the grant from the year 2016 to 2019 on: (1) Grant policy and management framework. What we found was, there was no formal written framework during the audit and the Ministry was in the drafting process when the audit was carried out, and under completion when we carried out a deliberation with the Ministry. I will borrow my friends, honourable Usamate’s favourite word, “flabbergasted”. The Committee was flabbergasted with this.</p><div><a name="109">Page 109</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 2295 HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! (Laughter) HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- As the Ministry of Sugar, with the honourable Minister and the Permanent Secretary and the debtors were in place for a number of years from 2011. What happened to all those grants that were paid from 2011 to 2015? How were they paid without a framework? (2) The administration of the grant. Again, flabbergasted. Accountability and transparency in grant management was generally weak; grant allotment lacked transparent system; grant agreements, payment vouchers were found missing in some cases; conflict of interest not being declared by FSC for the use of grants for farms; help in joint ventures; farmers did not always receive the grants on time and there were some elements of fraud, which were referred to FICAC. (3) The monitoring of grants, again, flabbergasted. Not performed to the requirements in the annual log plan at farm level, absence of proper system; and checks were not performed by the Ministry. (4) Reporting and evaluation, the programmes were yet to be evaluated and reported against the objective and the audit was carried out. So, all in all, it was a failure by the Ministry of Sugar. MR. SPEAKER.- You are resuming your seat very reluctantly because you went down slowly, very slowly. (Laughter) I will now offer the floor to the: 1. Honourable Hem Chand; 2. Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs; 3. Honourable Maharaj; and 4. Honourable Professor Prasad. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important Report. At the outset, I would like to thank the colleague Members of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir I have read the recommendations of the Committee and I hope the relevant stakeholders will take steps to implement it accordingly. I have noted in the Report that sugarcane farmers need support from the Government, from FSC, Sugar Research Institute and other stakeholders to maximise harvest. The Farmers are faced with a lot of issues and challenges, and I am going to highlight three: (1) Crop Protection - Crop Protection plays a vital role towards growth of sugarcane plants. It is important to protect the cane plants from the very beginning to be able to maximise the harvest. These will benefit both the farmers and the Sugar Industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cane farmers in Saweni, Dreketi, Verebatia, Lawaki and other nearby areas in Lautoka are currently facing huge problems, where cattle are damaging cane, and this has become a big issue to farmers. The matter was brought to the attention of FSC by concerned farmers this year in August and to date the matter remains unresolved. The Senior staff of FSC are also aware of the issue but nothing has been done and I feel very sorry for the cane farmers.</p><div><a name="110">Page 110</a></div><p>2296 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 23 rd Nov., 2023 (2) The second issue is High Cost of Living: The increase in VAT, corporate tax, increase in fuel prices is taking its toll on cane farmers. On top of this the farmers have to pay more for manual harvesting this year, compared to last year. Transportation cost, Tractor chargers, transportation of cane cutters, food cost of cane cutters have skyrocketed. The high cost of living to the increase in VAT, corporate tax and increase in fuel price is leaving the poor farmers with absolutely nothing. The cane farmers are struggling to make ends meet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, keeping in mind the high cost of harvesting, cane cutting, high cost of living, the Government should consider a guaranteed price that can assist farmers to mitigate all this cost. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been just reliably informed from some cane farmers in Ba, that cane is still left to be harvested and Rarawai Mill has already closed and Lautoka Mill is due to close soon. This will leave a lot of cane unharvested, it will be lost for farmers and also for the sugar industry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Reopen the Mill:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- I have highlighted some critical issues faced by farmers and I am sure the relevant Ministry will look into this urgently. Mr:</span> Speaker Sir, I commend the Committee’s report, and I support the motion before the house. Thank you. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, in fact the sugar has become more sweeter ever since I become the Minister. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- And it became more sweeter:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- And it became more sweeter when the honourable Prime Minister announced $5 price up for the sugarcane. So when you go to towns and cities now, you can see the smiles on the farmers faces. (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Listen! (Chorus of interjections) (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Is it part of the Report?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Sorry:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Where’s the report, (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- I will, I am coming there. This is the preamble, anyways, Mr. Speaker, what has happened is...</p><div><a name="111">Page 111</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 2297</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Dabe ga era:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- What has happened Mr:</span> Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica would agree, that look what I am saying, sometimes I wonder why are we are going and referring to reports which three years old, four years old.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- So what:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Come on, Just listen! What I am saying is, I have issues here, the Report of 2016 to 2019, we are three years behind. I actually wanted to see a Report that would be of 2021 because then I can correct what the industry has gone through. And I urge …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- You want to see our performance review:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.-..:</span> I urge that in future all the pending reports should be consolidated so</p><h4>that we can move forward on the present.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> In any business and Government is a business, if we are looking at a five year old report, we do not know what has happened. Here any private company for that matter we will monitor their accounts every quarterly so they can see where they are going. I am saying is one of the things that gives me a bit of confusion why these previous reports are being withheld. Anyway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Industry as I said, is here to stay and one of the businessmen lately met me during the Bred bank function (he was a Labasa businessman) and he said let us close the sugar industry and that person only because of sugar industry has thrived. Now we cannot close the sugar industry, the sugar industry is here to stay. That is why this Government has given 13 different programmes under the budget. There is $50 million worth of incentives. Now, what we are trying, Mr. Speaker, to see how we can diversify the sugar industry and Leader of the Opposition, look man you have not done that, let me do it, let me do it. You guys have failed, you guys have failed. (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- So 16 years, we are here for the last 10 months only. You are from Labasa, what have you done? (Laugher)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- When we are trying to do something help us out:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when he talks about bulldozer … (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- When he talks about bulldozer he does not know what I meant. Here the farmers are putting wrong varieties of cane on the farm. So what?</p><div><a name="112">Page 112</a></div><p>2298 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 23 rd Nov., 2023 (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH- You do not know about farming. You know about it? I am are farmer, I am are farmer. (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here look we have to, we have to look after the farms, we have to look after the farmers, we have to look out for the owners farmers right.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- You are still not a real farmer:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Who said what? (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Oh sorry. Mr. Speaker, I know that I made a lot of laughter in Parliament, but this is my last meeting with you and I hope to see you next year and we will talk more. Vinaka. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister for Sugarcane and Multi- Ethnic Affairs: my first question would be and this is what we actually noticed during the meetings by the Committee actually met with the Ministry and when they came to do the submission, this particular Ministry has a Budget of $51 million out of which $2 million is for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, $1 million under R, $1 million for Operations, left is around $49 million out of which $47.5 million goes to FSC as grant left with $1.5 million one of the smallest Ministry but yet this particular Ministry has two Permanent Secretaries …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Oh! My God.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Did PS make any analysis and surprising, Mr. Speaker, that Permanent Secretary for special project. All the money has gone to FSC. What the PS is doing in the Ministry? Wastage of money, Mr. Speaker. (Hon. C. J. Singh interjects) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- This honourable Minister cannot even talk on the Report. I am not sure what he is going to do to the industry. At first, Mr. Speaker, I thought he is from Labasa, he might be the saviour for the sugarcane industry but I tell you, Sir, what he had, the type of response from a Minister on a particular report.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, he also spoke about price increase. Let me tell you some financial mismanagement. First payment $40.15, second payment $13.38; then this Government came into the picture. The honourable Minister wanted to be all Hi5 gave $24.62. Balance was left for only $7.11. The total came to $85.26. We surpassed before the wash down payment come through. Then he went begging to the honourable Minister of Finance, “Please, we have extra paid $26 for Diwali, what will the people say? We need to give them something.”</p><div><a name="113">Page 113</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 2299 HON. C. J. SINGH.- You are misleading. I never beg the Prime Minister, understand? (Laughter) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, after realising there is nothing left in the Balance Sheet they had to get the money from where from the taxpayers $8.5 million of the taxpayers’ money gone wasted. Had they actually done a better financial management throughout the year this would not have happened, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Just because they wanted to be in the good books they gave $24 which was much more higher than the forecasted value back in March. If these kinds of things continue how much money we are going to lose through this Minister, Mr. Speaker. The Minister was supposed to be the saviour from Labasa. You will spoil our name, Honourable Speaker. (Laughter) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, we know that the sugarcane industry is suffering. We need to come up with the alternate crop. We have actually informed people on the other side. We need alternate crops. We have been doing some research. There was $1 million allocated to do the research for industrial hem. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister has jumped the gun from industrial hem he has actually gone on to the medicinal hem, please come back to the industrial hem, we will have a lot of overseas repatriation if you go to medicinal hem. Let us come back to industrial hem. Let us provide alternate crops. More than 60 percent of the farmers who are actually cultivating less than 150 tonnes. Sit down yar. (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- A Point of Order. You sit down! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- He is behaving like this with the honourable Members of Parliament. Imagine what his attitude would be towards the farmers, Honourable Speaker. Thank you, Honourable Speaker. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The Reserve Bank of Fiji just revised the growth forecast from 8.2 percent and that is good news. It shows that the economy is forging ahead. What it does show however is that the resource sectors are going to be a drag on the economy if these sectors do not perform and they include sugar, mineral, water, gold, forestry and to some extent, fisheries sectors as well. The tourism numbers is going to be about 4 percent higher than even 2019 let alone pre- COVID-19 and perhaps surpass 2018 as well depending on what happens between now and the end of December. What the honourable Assistant Minister and Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee pointed out very clearly and the figures showed in a very contrasting way. The performance of the Sugar Industry in the last 15 years, if you look at these two graphs just from the</p><div><a name="114">Page 114</a></div><p>2300 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 23 rd Nov., 2023 report itself, area versus cane production, you will find that cane production has declined in a much more rapid rate than the area under cane production. Similarly, if you look at the registered versus active growers where the decline also has been rapid. The audit report shows and it is the honourable Assistant Minister and the chairman of the Public Account Committee highlighted it very well and all the issues (nine or ten) basically points out that all these money that was being put into the Sugar Industry over the years at least from 2016 to 2019, if what the audit assessment says, then really Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a sad indictment of the leadership at all levels within the industry in the past. I think what we need to do obviously, at the end of the day the Sugar Industry without the farmers is not going to get anywhere. I think our focus and the honourable Minister Singh in the last eight to nine months has been focusing on that. I was actually quite disappointed with the contributions from the other side; both honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand. They are complaining about the number of resources that the Government has put in and particularly, the top up cane price. Honourable Hem Chand was talking about the escalating costs, but he refused to even acknowledge the fact in an honest way that the Government has tried to mitigate that by topping up the price. We have provided a number of programmes within the budget to support the farmers. I think we have to be honest if the economy is to remain at a sustainable path of growth. In 2024 – 2025, we will have to focus in the resource sector. I am glad that as a government, we have realised that in the long term, if you look at countries at Costa Rica you look at countries where tourism is also about 40 percent to 50 percent of GDP, one of the key components there apart from some of the other industries such as BPOs or services sectors, the agriculture sector in this country has a huge potential and our Government is going to focus on that. In fact, the National Economic Summit identified a number of areas and as part of the planning within the Ministry of Finance, we want to push that and make sure that the appropriate policies, interventions, monitoring and evaluation are carried in a timely manner so that there is no wastage, yet there is an increase in production and we can increase the contribution of the resource sectors to GDP. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to speak in Reply.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we left the best to the last.</p><p>Sir, we have heard all the comments from honourable Members who have contributed to this motion and the responsible Minister from the Ministry of Sugar and we plead with them and the relevant stakeholder in the Sugar Industry, should take note of all the recommendations and work together in addressing all the challenges and gaps identified and revitalise the Sugar Industry so that resources poured into this industry are not mismanaged or wasted. As stated by the Minister and as recommended we need another updated report or audit. At this point, I can say that things have improved, and we should support continuously the Sugar Industry. With those final comments, Sir, I thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put.</p><div><a name="115">Page 115</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 2301 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of today’s sitting and I thank you sincerely for bearing with the long sittings. It is not easy to cover all that we have covered in a day, given that this has been part of the week’s sitting and hoping to try and improve on this in next year’s calendar but in all, I thank you all for your contributions. The Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 9.47 p.m.</p><div><a name="116">Page 116</a></div><div><a name="117">Page 117</a></div><p>Reply to Written Question No. 192/2023 tabled on Thursday, 23 rd November, 2023 by the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport(Ref.
