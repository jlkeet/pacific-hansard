<body><h3>ITAUKEI AFFAIRS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>ITAUKEI AFFAIRS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 21 st November, 2023, I move: That the iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 26/2023), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, before I deal with the Bill with your indulgence, with heavy heart, I wish to formally announce the unfortunate passing away of the Chief Justice Kamal Kumar. His Lordship passed away at the care of doctors at the Oceania Hospital in Suva. The Honourable Chief Justice Kumar was born on 13 th December, 1963, passed away on the 21 st November, 2023. He had six brothers and three sisters, he attended Andhra Primary School in Lautoka and his secondary education was at Pandit Vishnu Deo Memorial in Saweni in Lautoka. He was married to Sunita Devi and he has two sons. His eldest son Kishnel resides in Brisbane and the youngest Shivneel resides with Kamal in Suva. The late Justice Kumar in January 1884 joined the law firm of Steward Radian Co. as a junior clerk until 1988 when the law firm of Steward Radian Co was wound up as a result of the Military Coup of 1987. He joined the ANZ Bank in Sigatoka in 1988 he then joined Young &amp; Associates as a Clerk in 1992. In 1994 he decided to study law, enrolled in Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane. He completed his Bachelor of Law Degree in March 2000 and was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Australia and Fiji and returned for the employment with the Young &amp; Associates as a Solicitor. In May 2012, he was appointed as a Puisne Judge of the High Court of Fiji. He was subsequently appointed as the Acting Chief Justice in 2019 and was confirmed the Chief Justice of Fiji. Throughout his adult life, he was known to be a charitable, and financially assisted several iTaukei and Indian students with their education. He had a quiet demeanour, and never sought acknowledgement for his social services to the community. The Government of the day, the Coalition Government, the legal fraternity, and I am sure the previous Governments, appreciate his service to the people of Fiji. The Coalition Government would like to pay tribute and sympathy to his family. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023, which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 21 st November, 2023. As highlighted before the honourable Members of this august Parliament on Tuesday, the Bill essentially seeks to amend the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944 to reinstate the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC), otherwise, referred to as</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 2240 the Bose Levu Vakaturaga. At its initial inception in 1875, the GCC comprised of Fijian Chiefs was established as an advisory body by the British Colonial Government, who had recognised the valuable insights that these traditional leaders could provide on indigenous affairs, and that their participation in the administration would result in a more effective governance of their respective people. The GCC considered matters relating to Native Provincial Regulation, taxes, laws and punishments, engaging in key discussions with the Colonial Government and making resolutions along the way. The active participation of the Council culminated in the creation of laws, such as the Native Lands Ordinance in 1881, the Fijian Affairs Ordinance in 1944, the development of the traditional system of land tenure and the Mataqali Land Unit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that also includes the establishment of schools such as, the Vulinitu, which is known as Queen Victoria School today and Adi Cakobau School. The Fijian Affairs Ordinance of 1944, now referred to as iTaukei Affairs Act 1944, is one of the core legislations pertaining to the indigenous people of Fiji, and section 3 of this Act provided for the GCC, which was to make recommendations and proposals for the benefit of the iTaukei people and to consider questions relating to the good governance and wellbeing of the iTaukei people. In early 2006, there were trainings conducted for village headman, mataqali leaders and clan leaders under a pilot project endorsed by the GCC, before the fateful day 6 th December coup d’e’ tat took place, the same year which ultimately saw the suspension of the Council in 2007. The GCC was eventually removed altogether in 2012, some five years later, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not by phasing out due to impracticality or lack of purpose, nor by collective desire of the population to do away with it but it was abrogated under an authoritarian rule through the iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Decree 2012, which deleted section 3 from the provisions of the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944 in the period prior to the return of democratic governance In our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji were not consulted by the regime at the time of the removal of the GCC. But regarding its re-instatement this time around under the Coalition Government, there was a Review Committee set up, wide consultations was held which have yield positive responses, as the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs had shared in his Ministerial Statement on Monday before honourable Members of this august Parliament. The publication in the Fiji Times on 7 th August, 2023 setting the results from the Tebbutt Times Poll, also found 64 percent of Fijians surveyed were in favour of reinstating the Bose Levu Vakaturaga and 76 percent overall when only the support and do not support responses were considered without the undecided responses and responses defusing to answer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although we stand in Parliament today as the elected representatives of the people, our leadership does not exist in a vacuum within our society. May I say that again, our leadership in Fiji does not exist in a vacuum within our society. For over a century and to the present day, many men and women have stood up in their chiefly capacity to govern, represent and advocate for the traditional vanua, a role which was reflected in the former provisions of the Act that was removed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is only befitting with God on our side, you are seated as the Speaker to hear this very emotional momentous occasion of a critical part of the iTaukei the GCC, they are not only for the iTaukei, it is for the entire people of Fiji who call Fiji, home.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 2241 On the 14 th June, 2023, His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, informed the 111 th Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva of Cabinet’s decision for Fiji to adopt an official position or support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples or what is called UNDRIP. The establishment of the GCC would provide crucial insight that is currently missing towards equitable governance and inclusive development at a time when statistics show a significant percentage of those living below the poverty line are iTaukei. I also echo the statement made by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management in the media whilst visiting Rotuma earlier in March this year that with respect to Rotuma, it is more a bottom-up approach that would be taken in progressing projects on the Island. It is not a two-men rule, it is not from the top-bottom, it is a bottom-up approach. It is one of consultation and reiterating the commitment of this Government in amplifying the mediums available for community dialogue. Earlier this year, work towards this end was progressed by the repeal of the Media Industry Development Act, which saw the return of a greater press freedom and in terms of the present Bill, it is the reinstatement of the GCC that would allow for a holistic approach towards solving the issues facing indigenous people today and related matters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Opposition Member, honourable Usamate, in his statement on Monday when referring to the GCC being the body which looks after everything in relation to iTaukei that stated and, again, I quote: “All these things are enshrined in the Constitution”. Mr. Speaker, while the Constitution recognises the iTaukei people, the ownership of iTaukei land and culture does not comprehensively deal with all these relating to the iTaukei and it is the facade and the mistake if the earlier government was hoodwinked by the former Attorney-General that everything is protected in the Constitution.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- That is absolute hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> If they have a good understanding of the law and the Constitution, we do not expect the nut and bolts of the law to be in the Constitution. You will find it in the Fijian Affairs Act. The reinstatement of the GCC is not made unnecessarily by the provisions of the Constitution. May I say this again -. the reinstatement of the GCC is not made unnecessarily by the provisions of the Constitution but rather the provisions of the Constitution make it necessary that the GCC be reinstated to effect the full realisation of the rights and aspirations contained therein. The Late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna is famously attributed in saying that, I quote: “The title of chief is not an ornament”. Much that he said about GCC is said from historical perspective. Therein lies the role of the present day torch bearers. As shared by honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs on Monday, the GCC will emerge as a revitalised structure based on the strategic recommendations of the GCC Review Committee that are in line with international standards which include that the GCC be neutral and apolitical. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a potential for stewardship of a traditional vanua to facilitate reconciliation and nation building efforts, as demonstrated of the Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui Dreketi, Ro Teimumu Kepa, who made headlines in 2017 by declaring the descendants of G irmitiyas as part of belonging to the Vanua o Noco in Rewa in a traditional ceremony that bestowed upon them cavuti na luvedra na Ratu.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>2242 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 The existence of the GCC does not necessitate the exclusion of other Fijians - a sentiment understood where the late Jai Ram Reddy who was a former Leader of the Opposition, briefly as an Attorney-General, President of the Court of Appeal and was the first Indo-Fijian to be invited to a meeting of the Council on 6 th June, 1997 at which he addressed the assembled Chiefs saying, and I quote: “The members of this Council are not just the chiefs of indigenous Fijians but all of Fiji”. With that said, Mr. Speaker, I now move on the pertinent features of the Bill. Clause 1 provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, the Bill will come into force on a date or dates appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. Clause 2 amends section 2 of the Act by inserting the definition of “Council” to mean the Great Council of Chiefs and the definition of “Permanent Secretary” to mean the Permanent Secretary responsible for iTaukei Affairs. Clause 3 of the Bill inserts section 3 to the Act to provide for the constitution and primary function of the Council. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 4(4) of the Act to require the iTaukei Affairs Board to refer to the GCC or the Bose Levu Vakaturaga any question relating to the iTaukei people that the Minister may submit to the Board. Clause 5 of the Bill amend section 5 of the Act to empower the Minister to make regulations in relation to the Great Council of Chiefs. Clause 6 of the Bill amend section 11 of the Act to require the Minister to refer to the Board or the Council any proposed Bill that is intended to be introduced to Parliament and which may appear to the Minister to affect in any important matter the rights and interests of iTaukei people. The Board or the Council, as the case may be, is then required to submit the proposed Bill with a memorandum which is to be used in the Parliamentary debate process. Clause 7 of the Bill consequently amends the iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004 to inter alia include reference to the Council. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the spirit of true democratic exercise, we have set out transparently the motivation and, in fact, the necessity for the reestablishment of the GCC within the codified ambit of law and anticipate healthy debate and contributions from the Opposition on the Bill that has been presented before this Parliament. This Bill does not introduce a new entity but brings back a Council that existed and functioned practically before, and which had best suited to give recommendations and proposals for the benefit, wellbeing and good governance of indigenous iTaukei and Rotuman people in light of the cultural dynamics and structures which purvey this nation and save the reality. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I have before me a list of speakers and the order is as follows:</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 2243 1. Honourable V. Naupoto; 2. Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 3. Honourable Ratu J. B. Niudamu; and 4. Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts. If time is still left, then we will take: 5. Honourable M. D. Bulitavu; and 6. Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are just being given one hour to allocate to this debate. We started at 4.36 p.m. and we shall stop at 5.36 p.m. The Right of Reply will be given at 5.16 irrespective of whether you have delivered your speech or not, but I apologise as this is how we are going to be managing our time - the one hour that we have been tasked to observe. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the chiefly system must be preserved and protected for as long as we can. More importantly, the sanctity of it must be preserved for without it, the system dies. The sanctity is preserved when the aura and the mana that surrounds our chiefly system is not violated, and we do that by observing the protocols and keeping alive the traditional structure that surrounds the chiefly system. We maintain our different roles and the boundaries in that traditional structure around our chiefly system. Words that are spoken around our chiefs, assist them with grace. Chiefs’ decisions are final, they are not scrutinised or critic, before they accept it. When all these are intact, we have deep reverence for our chiefly system, and as long as that reverence exists like now, the chiefly system will be protected. In the institutional history of the GCC, Sir, it was established in 1876 under the governorship of Sir Arthur Gordon. The decision was taken following consultations with chiefs who advised Sir Arthur Gordon on how best to govern the colony’s indigenous population. In the words of Anthropologist Robert Norton, and I quote: “It embodied the privileged relationship of trust and protection established between the Fijians and the British.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, to me, the GCC is the Westernisation of a very traditional itaukei governance system and because of it, the chiefly system is exposed to the ravages of the whims of change and it contributes immensely to the erosion of the sanctity of this chiefly system that is so dear to our hearts. Because the decision of the GCC is not final, contrary to the traditional way where it is final, according to the Act, the decisions of the GCC is presented to His Excellency the President. If a Bill is required, it is first presented to a Board, then to the Permanent Secretary, then to Cabinet and then to Parliament. In that process, Sir, the Bill may not pass, again, their decision is not final. A big criticism of the GCC in the past was the politicisation of it that is still relevant today. The GCC will always be politicised and it cannot shield itself from it. The GCC will face its fair share of criticism even in their last meeting, their decision to remunerate Turaga Ni Yavusa with $200 per month was heavily criticized on social media and even that decision was not final because it was slashed to $100 and approved here in this Chamber through the passing of the 2023-2024 Budget.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2244 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the best way to protect and preserve our chiefly system is, in my view, not to expose it but to shield it from the influences of change brought about by the globalised world that we live in now. Secondly, it has to be shielded in its purest form or as close to it as possible. It is in the traditional setting that this shielding is done. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these years without the GCC, the iTaukei continues to be served through the various arms of Government, through the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, there have been initiatives like royalty payments that was new, the Fiji Pine landowners have been paid up a total of approximately $30 million in Lease Security Bonus Payment and more importantly, our chiefly system has been shielded in its traditional setting as I had alluded to. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, now that Government will reinstate the Great Council of Chiefs, we must be reminded of the words of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna when he warned them in 1944 and I quote: “If we confine ourselves to pleasure seeking only, no useful purpose will be served in our maintaining our claims to chiefly status. If we are merely decorative, our position is finished forever, we will soon be tossed aside when some other races rise to the fore.” HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on this Bill. I would like to thank the honourable Attorney-General and also the honourable Naupoto for their contributions this far. I have a prepared address, but I just want to go back some correspondences over time. On 8 th September, 2006, I got this letter written, it was written in vosa vaka-Viti: “Au sa mai ciqoma na nomuni vola kau sa vaka vakavinavinaka sara kina vakalevu. Au a sega ni rawa ni volavola yani vei kemuni baleta ni a sega ni tiko vei au e dua na i lavelave ni nomuni vosa.

Au via vakaraitaka ga yani na noqu kauwai ena nodra lewa na gone turaga bale na Peresitedi ena veivakasalatoki nai talai kina Matanitu Tu Vakawawa, me sa bokoci na na nomuni lewena tudei (se tini mate) na Bose Levu Vakaturaga.” These were some expressions of concern and this one was signed, “ Ko Joni kei Lusi Wekamuni mai Naicobocobo” I am glad that I am part of this Bill that has been brought before this august Chamber and we are going to be looked upon as bringing back a bipartisan Bill. But I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we will not vote on partisan lines today, that we will vote in the interest of the nation. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear!</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>2246 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my brief contribution to the Bill that is before Parliament. Bula si’a. I have just received the Bill while the honourable Attorney- General was introducing it. After listening to the Ministerial Statement on Monday by the Turaga nai Talai, the Minister for iTaukei Affairs, he talked about the recommendations by the GCC Review Committee that was tabled to the 2 nd GCC Meeting that was held in Suva. In his speech he had said that the future GCC would be something that needs to be apolitical” meaning the findings of the Committee probably had found out too that the GCC or the new GCC or the future GCC that he had put in his statement needs to be apolitical. It should not be mixed with politics and that was admitted by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs. On the other hand, the honourable Viliame Naupoto had said that while the GCC was not present, in the Act, the board was carrying the functions and roles of the GCC. If you see the current amendment that was being introduced by the honourable Attorney-General, it is just inserting the word “council” back into the Act and to play the role that the board was playing when the GCC was abolished in the decree that he is talking about. I will not talk about the politics and the emotional arguments about the GCC, I will just go straight to the clauses, to the salient features of the Bill which I would like Parliament to see that is very important. First of all, he is suggesting an amendment to clause 3 and I quote: “There needs to be a Great Council of Chiefs which must consist of persons appointed by the President on the advice of the Minister.” In the original 1944 Act, those words, “on the advice of the Minister” is not there. The wording is, “person(s) who were appointed by the Governor-General”. In this particular clause, why it was very important to refer this Bill to the Committee would have been more consultations done and whether the powers now given to the Minister to advice the President in any appointment, how will it be vetted? A Minister, as we all know, is a politician, a political appointment and a political decision could influence the appointment of any GCC member given that they will be advising the President in any of the appointments. If you look at the original Act, that is not there so that is a new insertion on the advice of the Minister. The second thing that I would like to also share is on clause 4. When a particular question or recommendation is brought to the Council through the Minister, the powers that are there in the original Act that it must or should be referred to the Great Council of Chiefs. In the current form, it has somewhat weakened the Council in the words in clause 4 where we will be inserting, if you read sub-section 4 of the Principal Act, it will be amended to insert, “it may refer such questions to the Council”. So, that has somewhat given powers to the Minister and somehow the original Act talks about that the Minister needs to refer that to the Council. In here, the Great Council of Chiefs is being undermined because the powers will be with the Ministers. These are some of the wordings that are there that is very, very important. If you go to clause 5 of the Bill and you go to the Principal Act, there is a poor drafting done in terms of the words “wherever it appears” and the words that are being referred to in clause 5 are the words “of the”. If you look at that particular section in the principal Bill, there are three times the words “of the” appears in that section 5, but how it was drafted here, it only refers to two occasions, that is in sub-sections (a) and (b) that refers to this. So, there is poor drafting too done there that needs to be re-done.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 2247 The other thing that needs to be looked at in clause 6 where you have the introduction of a Permanent Secretary in the procedures of a Bill concerning an iTaukei that comes through the Council. After the discussion by the Great Council of Chiefs, it is brought back to the board to make its papers before it goes to Cabinet. In the original Act it talks about, after it comes from the GCC it goes to the Clerk Parliament. That has been removed in this particular amendment, an introduction of the Permanent Secretary that is in the form of the Bill that we have. The GCC had a standalone legislative procedure. After they have discussed any legislation concerning iTaukei, it comes from the Minister, goes right to the Clerk of Parliament or the Secretary-General of Parliament; that is being removed in clause 6 of the Bill. I hope the honourable Attorney-General will relook into this because these are very important questions. If we had taken the Bill to Committees, we would have picked it up and also compared with the original Act, compared with the 2012 Decree and compared with the current form of the Bill that you have introduced and we will also look into the recommendations of the Review Committee of the Great Council of Chiefs so we can make a better form of the Bill that is long lasting and not come back running into Parliament for future amendments. The last part is clause 7, the Bill states that these are just consequential amendments. There is another very important thing that this particular Bill has removed, that is, if you look at the iTaukei Trust Fund, the membership of the board, I will refer you to section 7(3): “The board consists of eight members to be appointed by the Minister including: (a) Five members nominated by the GCC.” That veto power, nominated by the GCC has been removed by this particular Bill which now says that five members must have a suitable qualification and work experience in any of the following areas: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Investment management; Engineering; Information and technology; Human capital; Tourism and hospitality That is a new insertion and that has taken away the veto of power of the GCC where five Members are nominated by the GCC into the iTaukei Trust Fund. I urge the Government to relook at the Bill. If it was done at a rush, I would like the Government and the honourable Attorney-General to withdraw it and refer it to Committees so we can fix and repair the Bill as it is. MR. SPEAKER.- We have only two minutes left for debate. So given that, I now offer the floor to the honourable Attorney-General for his Right of Reply because by 17.36 p.m. we should be finishing debate on this particular motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.:</span> My apology, Mr. Speaker.</p><p>The contribution from honourable Naupoto was relevant but here we are hearing someone who is not an expert in drafting. I do not know what his experience is for him to comment on the</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>2248 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 semantics, it is just waste of time. Section 82 of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, states that the President acts on the advice of Cabinet or a Minister or of some other body in the exercise of their executive authority. The referral of questions to the GCC because it must first be assessed as something substantive to be referred to the GCC. We have the Fijian Affairs Board refers to Cabinet then if it sees something that is relevant then it will go to the GCC. This is only an interim measure explained by the Minister for Home Affairs. The review, the future and shape of the GCC will be in a trust form and it will take two years, so we need the GCC to be sitting deliberating on the process to be discussed in the shape and form of the new GCC. The proposed Bill processes is prior to submission to Cabinet. It does not change the essence of the intention to ensure that the GCC comments are considered at the highest level of law making during parliamentary process. The iTaukei Trust Fund of 2004 qualifications submitted by the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs since five members were repealed. There is no other substantive comment to make. I believe the essence of the Bill and why it is relevant has been considered, are there for endorsement. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast Ayes Noes Not Voted - Abstained - - 28 - 22 3 1 Motion agreed to. [iTaukei Affairs (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 26/2023) moved under Standing Order 51 was passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. of 2023)]</p></body>
