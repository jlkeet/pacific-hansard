<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Review Report - Energy Fiji Limited 2021 Annual Report HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Review Report on the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 Annual Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) faced unprecedented challenges in 2021 due to COVID-19, in particular, the second wave of the pandemic which significantly impacted EFL’s electricity demand. The Committee noted an increase in the number of domestic customers benefitting from subsidies provided by EFL, especially after 2020, and acknowledges EFL for this initiative given that a number of customers were affected by the pandemic. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of Government’s commitment to climate change, the Committee noted the importance of EFL embarking on Renewable Energy Sites Projects, and strongly recommends for the inclusion of key stakeholders, such as landowners in the land acquisition process. It is also recommended that all efforts be made to ensure that the pending Power Purchase Agreements are expedited to achieve the current target of 100 percent Renewable Energy by 2036. The Committee noted the need for Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical aspects of EFL’s regulatory functions, such as the registration of licensed electricians and ensuring standard compliance are met. In this regard, the Committee recommended for FCCC to recruit the necessary expertise required to regulate the services of EFL. While deliberating, the Committee noted a slow increase in the use of solar rooftop installations and encourages the use of solar powered products by domestic and commercial customers as an alternative to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>2192</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the entities that appeared before the Committee and for being prompt in responding to the various queries and questions raised by the Committee.

TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Review Report on the Energy Fiji Limited 2022 Annual Report. While deliberating on the 2022 Report, the Committee noted that EFL managed to make a healthy profit despite the various challenges and unforeseen expenses they had to endure during the financial year and commends the team at EFL for maintaining its financial soundness. The Committee noted that EFL’s existing Risk Mitigation strategies provided substantial support to the company during the adverse impact of COVID-19. This included strategies to address the disruption in EFL’s supply chain and the minimising of the effects of rising fuel costs through its Hedging Programme. It was noted with concern the damages to EFL’s infrastructure which occurred due to various reasons such as motor vehicle accidents that damaged power poles, overgrown vegetation clashing with power lines, third-party damage to EFL underground cables and vandalism of EFL assets. The Committee would like to urge members of the public to be mindful of EFL’s infrastructure to ensure that they continue receiving undisrupted electricity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, EFL lost 54 technical employees for greener pastures overseas. Given that EFL is an essential service provider, it is imperative to further develop strategies to entice technical employees from moving overseas. The Committee was made aware that multiple Renewable Energy Projects are in the pipeline at present. However, the Committee is concerned that our National Targets to meet 100 percent Renewable Electricity by 2036 might not be achievable. While hearing submissions, the Committee was made aware that various applicants who intended to invest in Renewable Energy Programmes had their applications rejected. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the entities that appeared before the Committee for being prompt in responding to the various queries and questions raised by</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2193 the Committee.

Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Corrections Service 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Corrections Service 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Corrections Service is obligated under the Corrections Service Act to serve the public by keeping in custody those convicted by the courts, in providing effective corrective and rehabilitation services, whilst applying all relevant human rights obligations and standards. This Report captures the review findings and recommendations of the Committee in respect of the pertinent issues noted from the contents of the Fiji Corrections Service 2018-2019 and the Fiji Corrections Service 2019-2020 Annual Reports. For the review, the Committee conducted extensive deliberation on the Annual Reports, whereby issues were identified and correspondences regarding these issues were made with the FCS and its representatives. Some of the main areas of discussion addressed in this Report are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The Fiji Corrections Service is committed to reducing the high number of contraband entering correctional facilities. The Fiji Corrections Service continues to work towards its responsible target by safely detaining and rehabilitating persons sentenced to imprisonment or placed on remand at its correctional centres pending trial by the courts. The Fiji Corrections Service has no control over the number of persons incarcerated by the courts, therefore, does not have means to minimise overcrowding issues within the correction facility. The Fiji Corrections Service has taken humanitarian steps to monitor and provide day care towards inmates of old age. This has subsequently exposed the lack of facilitation for inmates that are at risk with respect to mental and health problems. The Fiji National Budget 2022-2023 provided funding for a Job Evaluation Exercise to be conducted for the FCS staff with the view to reviewing salaries. The FCS engaged a consultant company - Maxumise Pte. Limited to conduct the JEE, which was to conclude in early October 2023. The Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Finance now have the responsibility to evaluate and determine its outcome.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>2194</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 6. The Committee during its tour of Correction facilities was informed of the land tenure issues at its Levuka Corrections Centre. The Committee notes that the Fiji Correction Service has taken steps to protect tenure on the Mataqali land by signing a 99-year lease agreement with Land Owning Unit Yavusa Totogo beginning in 2017. 7. At the conclusion of this review, the Committee believes that the majority of the issues identified in the review, have been adequately addressed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Members of the Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee - honourable Iliesa Vanawalu (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Mosese Bulitavu, honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua and honourable Faiyaz Koya, for their deliberations and input. I also acknowledge the representatives of Fiji Corrections Service, who made themselves available to make submissions which assisted the Committee in its work. Mr. Speaker Sir, I hereby commend the Committee’s Report to Parliament, and I request all honourable Members to take note of the Report. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. RATU R. S. S.
