<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT -FIJI POLICE FORCE 2017-2020 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - FIJI POLICE FORCE 2017-2020 ANNUAL REPORT HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that we are all awake, I move: That Parliament debate the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Police Force 2017- 2020 Annual Reports.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, for those that may have noticed, there is a year missing in between these two consolidated Reports. That Report has already been debated here in Parliament, because it came to the Committee in this order. There are nine recommendations in our</p><div><a name="103">Page 103</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 2289 Report and I urge the Fiji Police Force to look at those recommendations and read the Report. They are worth looking at and it will certainly help in the conduct of their operations. When we talk about the Police, I think we should also remember that this is the Force that works on the not so good side of the humanity, but the dark side of humanity. That is them and that is where they expose themselves to, so that we can live on the better side of humanity. They need to be resourced well and structured well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just talk a little bit on the first recommendation to look at the merits of setting up one emergency communications and dispatch Unit, like the 911 units that they have overseas. Right now, we have 911, 917, 919 and 913 for EFL. During one of our meetings with the police present, I called these numbers. We called 911, and after the 12 th ring I had to turn it off because no one answered. I called 917, which is the Fiji Police, again, no one answered and after the 12 th ring we had to turn it off. I think it is worth looking at setting up just one emergency communication and dispatch unit. Upon inquiry, if you call 917, which is in Nakasi and someone robbing your home in Nakasi and you are calling 917, the Nakasi Police Station off the road, if no one answers, that call is diverted to the West. If someone answers it is from the West, and then connected back to Nakasi Police Station. I urge the honourable Minister may be worthwhile project to look at is setting up the emergency communication and dispatch unit. I will leave it at there and may be the other speakers can speak on the content of the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- I have speakers listed here: 1. Honourable Tuinaceva; 2. Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; 3. Honourable Naivalurua; and 4. Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Police Force. At the outset, I just want to congratulate the Committee on a great report. It is well researched, well-articulated, thorough and well presented. Again, I want to thank the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to make some remarks on Item 6 on Recommendations 3.1.7 Road Fatalities. Before I delve further, I want to take this time to acknowledge the Fiji Police Traffic Division for their hard work, dedication and commitment in trying to control carnage on our roads, despite being under resourced and lack of power to make their road enforcement work more effective. The Report summarises certain areas and the challenges faced by the Police Traffic Division. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year (2023) so far has not been a good year in terms of road accidents and fatalities, from road safety’s standpoint. We have a road death epidemic on our hands. When we record eight deaths in two weeks and a total of 161 accidents in 16 days as reported by the Police, it tells us we are at a point of crisis. The Report mentioned that from the period 1 st January to 23 rd August, 2023, there have been 60 road fatalities compared to 23 in the same period last year. The latest report released by Police last week says our road fatalities from 1 st January to second week of November 2023, there have been 72 fatalities compared to 38 in the same period last year. That is an increase of almost 90 percent. On the 72 deaths, 31 were pedestrians, 21 passengers,</p><div><a name="104">Page 104</a></div><p>2290 Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 23 rd Nov., 2023 20 were drivers, and that is on fatalities. For accident cases only from 1 st January to October 2023, there have been 3,062 accident cases on our roads. Mr. Speaker, for the whole of 2022, there were only 44 road deaths. We can see that our roads have turned into a killing field. That is why I said we are at a point of crisis. Mr. Speaker, Sir about 80 percent accidents on our roads are caused by overspeeding and about 70 percent of deaths are caused by overspeeding. To my view, the Fiji Police Traffic Division is trying their utmost best to make our road safe and reduce fatalities. Now, to effectively police, the stretch of public roads of about 7,000 kilometres that is used by around 140,000 vehicles is a massive task. From 1 st January to 2023 – August 2023 the Police made a total of 30,000 bookings on speed violations as they tried to cut down on road carnages and I salute those efforts. I noted from the Report that Police has revamped its traffic operations through a joint operations with LTA to conduct stop-checks, radar operations, breathalyser, operations and media awareness. Streamlining operations to achieve optimal result is a great idea but that is not enough. The challenge is for the Police to intensify where road safety were and take it to another level. They will need to well structured, well-resourced and well trained to cope with road safety demand. They will need a good relevant and practical Road Safety Action Plan to guide them. Perhaps certain powers currently with LTA to be passed over to Police. It will help them to be more capable and more effectual. Their advantage is they can operate around the clock seven days a week. That is what we need right now on our roads. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Traffic Police will need to be equipped better. Their devices to be up to date. It is not only about traffic offences it is also about road crimes road crimes. We have all sorts of illegal activities out there on the roads. Let us give Police more hand laser speed detected machines. It is time to equip them with more mobiles speed cameras, let us give them some traffic violation cameras, they need to be equipped with average speed camera system and more red light cameras. I call on the Honourable Minister of Finance to assist our policeman and women, give them money so they can do the job and make our road safe. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude road accident is costing our economy big dollars. For the figure I have got which is not the latest is around $50 million a year. What is that compared to the loss of life? Pain and grieves to the families and victims that will be with them through the rest of their lives. Let us spin that million dollars, give it to police and LTA for preventative road safety measures. With that Sir, I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- You should have said a long time ago. I thank you. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief. First of all, let me thank the Committee for this very elaborate report and for the recommendations that the Chairman of the Committee has alluded to earlier. Very briefly, I will try to just go through the recommendations and what we are doing to date to address these areas of concern that the Committee has highlighted. On the matter of the emergency number, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure you that the matter has been brought to the National Security Council about a month ago and there is a paper that is</p><div><a name="105">Page 105</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 2291 pending before Cabinet. Essentially, what it is to align all of the emergency numbers into one, it is just one number of us all to remember so I will leave it with that and then we can come out, we will all know. The second recommendation; Fiji Police be assisted in terms of appropriate adequate facilities for storage and administration of exhibits. This definitely needs extra resourcing and I know we have been working with Ministry of Finance in the past to try and work at this because without proper protection for exhibits it is very hard to prosecute people successfully. I have toured almost all of our stations in Fiji and this is a big problem. I want to thank the previous government for the new police stations that we have and they actually do have the kind of space that we need and the kind of protection and security to secure exhibits. But the current state of the exhibit rooms everywhere for a very long time has been under a lot of neglect and needs money and upgrade. That is what we pursue to do or we aim to do. Implementation of body-worn and vehicle mounted cameras. I have spoken about this earlier during one of my earlier speeches; something that we endeavour and this is also because of two parts. Not only for the safety of the public who are being arrested but also for the sanctity of the work of the police to protect them. Obviously, this is part of the things that we would really like to do and in the long term, work of the police this is something that we would like to achieve. Obviously, we talked about the integration of that into, for instance, the security systems that are down at Central Police Station (CPS). Ideally, we would like to leave these cameras live onto those things but this is something hopefully we can get in time through proper resourcing. Counselling capacity, I am happy to announce the police do have a Psychology Unit and that was established in 2021 after this Report was done. Police work is hard, it takes its toll on the family. So, they really need to be helped, carry out their jobs sincerely, mutually and of course professionally. That unit is available within the Fiji Police Force headquarters right now for the benefit of our policemen. Specialist allowance: there are many areas; hard work, uniform, detective - I wish we had enough money we could give it to them today, unfortunately this is something we need to work at progressively, but I hear the call of the Committee and it is something that we must do and we fully support that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Developing effective studies to reduce the numbers of road fatalities, I thanked Mr. Naisa Tuinaceva, ultimately, I think many people forget in Fiji the responsibility of our roads is not with the Police, it is with the Land Transport Authority. The Police exercise only the Land Transport Authority Act. The Police whilst they carry out needs resourcing, I recognise especially equipment and even roles to help them but obviously this is something we need to factor into Police resourcing into the future. Mr. Speaker, animal cruelty something we take for granted absolutely true, we see a lot of stray dogs. People just go and kick them but this is not so much about the Police, this is just about society. These are creations of God we should look after them. There are proper places where you need to take them to if they need to be disposed of definitely, I agree with that. Dealing with hate crimes, this is something that we can all do together. The police do not have so much capacity to be able to do this. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that, but it is something we need to work at as a community; do not hate, no good for Fiji.</p><div><a name="106">Page 106</a></div><p>2292 Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 23 rd Nov., 2023 Community policing at the centre of our work and this is something that under the “Restore Blue” is something that we will bring to the centre, better to prevent than to cure. Sorry, I took up too much time, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister’s responses to the recommendations. There is really not much to say and I am very positive and very supportive. But as a general comment when we examine these reports and if you fast track it forward for the next ten years, you will find that the Police Force will continue to face challenges at a strategic level, at the operational level and also at the technical level. This was confirmed in the recent visit by the Committee, that some of the issues can be resolved internally without much cost there. For example, Complaints Against the Police (CAP) and Complaints Against the Services (CAS) do not really need any technology, all it needs is good management, leadership and consistency at the sharp end of things. When people come and report and there is no feedback or responses, this is where the complainants come in. That can easily be resolved internally without any cost at all. Small things like the Water Police, honourable Minister Mr. Speaker, Sir, things like the foul weather kit that we visited. These are things that are essential equipment for those that work out there and it is very important that that can be resolved internally, does not need a big budget, all it needs is it needs to be resolved by the Operation Commanders on the ground. Fast forwarding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Police is an organisation that cannot really be involved in the catch-up game. There is a change in security situation and similarly evolving criminal situations and they need to be on top of these. In my personal assessment really the situation is up here and the Police Force is really down here. The simple strategy is to take them up here and beyond the real time situation at this point. Let me just simply finish by responding to a leadership comment by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister this evening. On that note, leadership is also a very important part in any organisation to the Police Force I see there is investment into that because as we all know everything rises and falls on leadership. A response to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Yes, you said that the Leader of the Opposition pleaded for the honourable Prime Minister to change. In leadership, the leader makes a decision based on the advisors of his inner core or those that have sit around and provide those advice and he makes those calls. Yesterday history was made where our leader the honourable Prime Minister turn to an alternative advice and that advice was from this end of the House. He provided that and he made his decision based on the alternative advice. The decision was made by the honourable Prime Minister on the national interest and in his primary core mission is to serve the best interests of the nation. So my call this afternoon there is always an alternative advice available at this end of the House to you honourable Prime Minister onto the other side. HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to make a small contribution. As you know, I am also part of the Committee that was scrutinising this Report, and we had some very extensive consultations with all the necessary stakeholders. It was a bipartisan approach, we did away with politics, and we committed ourselves to the call of this Parliament to try and improve the condition of our people in the Fiji Police Force. That is why we made a lot of consultations, we went around the country, we reached Taveuni, and judging by the Report and what they are facing on the ground, it is not only for us sitting here and looking at the Report. We made sure we went around and spoke to responsible officers, officers</p><div><a name="107">Page 107</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 2293 on the field to get a feeling of what they were facing in terms of the duties that are being assigned to them to undertake for our country. As I have said, it was a bipartisan approach, no politics in that. We had a lot of issues that we raised with the stakeholders, we did some consultations, some face to face, and from the nine recommendations we made sure that it is not only for Parliament to note, we had made a commitment that we will try and revisit these recommendations and try to talk to respective Ministries and stakeholders and ask them to include in their submission for next year’s financial budget. We even visited the Border Security in Nadi, and we found that they were congested in one of the small rooms. They are the first image that tourists see when coming to Fiji, and I hope that, perhaps, the Minister and those responsible will try and improve the working conditions of those in Border Security. As I have said, it is not only for Parliament to note the Report, we have made a commitment through our Chair, that we will try and re-visit all the recommendations and make sure we talk to the relevant Ministries and stakeholders, so that we will be able to improve the working conditions that are faced by our people out there, especially the Fiji Police Force. That is my small recommendation, we had nine recommendations, but I think that most of the speakers who have spoken before me have talked on all the nine recommendations. I am just talking generally on the outcome of our visitation and looking at the Report and what we intend to do after submitting this Report to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is all that I wish to contribute, and I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- You are beginning to sound like your neighbour. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.R. VOCEA.:</span> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but thank you.</p><p>(Laughter) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just thank the Fiji Police Force for the work that they do and their family that support them and I wish them well. I commend the Report to Parliament, Sir, for noting. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- I think by listening to all that we have heard from the various speakers, it seems that what we have been slowly discussing as well as from the Report that was provided to us by the Australian Federal Members of Parliament on the role of Parliament and make it more interesting. I think we are really far behind in how we do our work. We have been just concentrating like we have been doing for the whole of this week, working on Annual Reports, Reports that have been late, so late and can we go beyond what has been identified from the Annual Reports. By going into policy issues then we will have to discuss that</p><div><a name="108">Page 108</a></div><p>2294 Performance Audit Report – Implementation of the Sugarcane Development &amp; Farmers Assistance Programme 23 rd Nov., 2023 with the Government of the day because that is what the Committees are doing in Australia and elsewhere, even in the UK. Make it more interesting as offered by honourable Naivalurua and now honourable Vocea. They want to go beyond just submitting the Reports. No, they want to continue to see that more is done out of what they have come up with in the Reports that they have worked so hard to produce back into Parliament. So, we can take another few 10 steps further from just reviewing Annual Reports but that depends on the Government of the day and depends on you honourable Members. How we can further discuss it and come to an agreement as to how best we can make the role of Members of Parliament more lively especially for us in helping the Government of the day carry out its work as well. That is something that we are working on but I am just happy to throw this across again because I have noticed that we are already doing it, we are doing it in parts now. It is slowly coming out but it just a matter of organising things and putting it together and having the Government to agree to it.</p></body>
