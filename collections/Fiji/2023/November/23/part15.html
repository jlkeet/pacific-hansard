<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the first Oral Question from honourable Rinesh Sharma has been made redundant. Since the honourable Minister for Fisheries has given his Ministerial Statement, we hope that takes care of the question. (Question No. 183/2023 was withdrawn) Climate Action Transparency Phase 2 Project (Question No. 184/2023) HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the Project Cooperation Agreement for the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency Phase II Project? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the question on the Project Cooperation Agreement for the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT). This project is fully funded by the United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS). There are no financial implications to the Fiji Government and the project funding for phase 2 is US$139,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet at its meeting on 24th October, 2023 approved the signing of the Project Cooperation Agreement for phase 2 of the initiative for Climate Action Transparency which is an ongoing Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this second phase of the project is focused on: 1. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Management System; 2. Data institutionalisation from Nationally Determined Contribution; and 3. Tracking and policy making. The Cabinet at its meeting held on the 24th October, 2023 approved the project cooperation agreement between the government of Fiji and UNOPS as I said before. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think some honourable Members are wondering why I am wearing this tie. Today is Thanksgiving Day in the United States of America. It was first celebrated in the first harvest after the first European settlers settled there. I am not promoting America or anything. The background, the UNFCCC as we have heard this week was ratified in 1992 by the SVT and GVP Coalition Government which I had the honour to lead from 1992 to 1999. It required State parties to regularly report on their climate change commitments and progress of National Climate Actions. For developing countries like Fiji, reporting is done through our national communication reporting on climate change every four years and also biannual reports every two years. These reports</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2222 contains greenhouse gas inventory. The inventory is an account of greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane, et cetera immediate to the atmosphere per sector on an annual basis. We are aware of the various sectors that can contribute to these greenhouse gases including agriculture and beef and dairy farming as well as rice. Inventories are used to establish a baseline for tracking emission plans, develop climate change mitigation strategies and policies and assess national progress. The Paris Agreement signed at COP21 sets out an enhanced transparency framework for countries to promote effective implementation of the Agreement. To support countries in this regard, the Initiative of Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) was created as a multi-stakeholder partnership in 2015 bringing together multiple countries, various sectoral experts as well as public and private stakeholders at all levels of governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative for climate action transparency provides countries with tailored support and practical tools and methodologies to build robust transparency frameworks needed for effective climate action in sync with national development priorities. Fiji ICAT was one project with the Climate Change Division (CCDE) together with the Ministry of Agriculture developed a Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report for rice cultivation and livestock. A guidance document for determining greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector was also issued. Phase 1 enabled the identification and assessment of two agricultural policies for greenhouse gas and sustainable development impact. The project also resulted in the development of an overarching institutional arrangement and recommendation for a National Reporting System and Design for the Fiji National Greenhouse Gas Inventory for Agriculture. Fiji ICAT Phase 2 Project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is the subject to this question will enable alignment of sectoral monitoring, reporting and verification systems with enhanced transparency framework of the Paris Agreement. I am sure you are all aware of the Paris Agreement, the attempt of the nations of the world to get global warming down to 1.5 or less than 1.5 degrees centigrade by 2030. The first place of the ICAT Project identified at the national monitoring, reporting and verification system blueprint developed for the agriculture sector could be replicated for other greenhouse gas sectors. This system blueprint will now be piloted to the fluorinated gases sub sector of the Industrial Process and Product Unit (IPPU) sector. The project timeline is expected to be 13 months and this phase of ICAT Project will enhance the ability of extension from the Ministry of Agriculture to contribute to the national reports required under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Phase 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will further strengthen their ability to measure the greenhouse gas mitigation abatement impact of introducing biogas digestors in community. The project will strengthen the Department of Environment database on hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). This will inform policy around the importation of air conditioning and refrigeration into the country. Phase 2 will also address the Ministry of Local Government and Department of Environment challenges in collecting waste collection data from the various municipalities. This ICAT project will aid in understanding solid waste disposal issues as well as the opportunities for methane recovery but also address other issues such as land and marine pollution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to update Parliament on this important</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2223 Project. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I have a supplementary question to the honourable Prime Minister but I need to acknowledge this great step into the implementation particularly climate action steps that would help us in fight against global warming. My simple question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is all about green gas and you are well aware of the fight on methane particularly on energy, agriculture and waste. But, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, apart from greenhouse gas data and recording and the actions that we do, also very critically is our implementation of our Nationally Determined Contributions. We have a reporting process in that area as well, Sir. The question is, how is the Climate Change Office approaching this or if we have not made so much effort into it, then probably it is something that the Government has to consider seriously because this is how our mitigation contributions are also recorded under the UNFCCC process? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- I think that is a very pertinent supplementary question. It challenges the Government to update or upskill its workers. You will have noticed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there was an article in the news two days ago about the appointment of a new Permanent Secretary for Climate Change and he had been involved in the international arena for some years and has come home to serve. He has not been appointed, they have made the announcement but he will be part of the group going up to COP. The Australian Government have been very kind as to second to us an expert from the Climate Change Division of the Civil Service in Australia to help out with our records and data keeping to justify our request. The Small Island Developing Nations have been complaining about the tardiness of the assistance they get. It has been because of their submissions for this funds have not been properly staffed and we are going to have the officers properly staffed. We are also looking at other things like the landfill in Naboro and whether we can harvest anything from the old dump we have in Lami et cetera. Those are things that we are doing. We had an old chap from Tailevu (senior to me at school) who manage the Manukau Dump for many years and then he came to start the one in Naboro during our time and it is time now that we look at harvesting gas from that landfill. MR. SPEAKER.- I just want to share something regarding the statement made by the honourable Prime Minister in terms of the tardiness of these Small Island States. It is quite something to work with them and see how they have been going on their own, it is sad. Even though they are seriously affected, but their tardiness, kind of, stands out. Those are some of our island neighbours who are now suffering from these issues which have been raised by the honourable Prime Minister. They are coming to meetings, sometimes you do not feel embarrassed but sometimes you laugh - this is the Pacific way. How they are dressed, just a pair of shorts, flip flops and they come to international meetings to register themselves. When they go back, we will be talking amongst ourselves. Isa, this is where we are and how we are doing it. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is something that we really should be talking about. There are nature-based solutions that the honourable Leader of the Opposition is very much aware of and there are also our own men thought-up solutions of reclamation and trying to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels. We have a Fiji company that is working with the Government of Kiribati in the reclamation of some of their islands, also shipping, landfill all the way from Fiji to Kiribati to build up their islands.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2224</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 ECE Curriculum and Salary of Teachers (Question No. 185/2023) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the steps being undertaken by the Ministry to address the ECE sector, particularly the ECE Curriculum and salary of teachers? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for again asking another question regarding the Ministry of Education. This time around, this one is a very crucial sector in terms of the education regarding Early Childhood Education and some of the long overdue issues regarding teachers’ salaries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently Na Noda Mataniciva is the current curriculum that has been used by the Early Childhood Education. I see the honourable Member is nodding his head in agreement to what I am saying from this end. Since 2009, this curriculum needs to be reviewed to be on par with the changes and demands that have occurred during the period from 2009–2023. There was a forum of Fiji ECE subject analysis that was done in 2022 where there was discussion to review the Early Childhood Education curriculum in 2023 so this will be undertaken in 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding teachers first of all we need to review the resources that have been allocated to address the ECE. Currently, there is only one or two ECE officers that look after closed to 800 ECE schools around Fiji. So after the Fiji National Educational Summit there were plans to set up and put more emphasis on the Early Childhood Education with the positions to be filled up for the position of Director ECE, Principal Officer, Senior Curriculum Specialist. These are some of the proposed positions that were discussed in the Fiji National Education Summit: a Senior Education Officer for ECE, Research Officer and nine district officers (advisors) that will be responsible to seeing the smooth operations of the ECEs schools in the various districts around Fiji. The proactive steps that need to be taken by the Ministry will contribute to the development of our nation’s young minds and ensuring that our dedicated teachers who play a very important role receive a recognition and the remunerations that they deserve. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw attention to the disparity that had been experienced by the Ministry of Education ECE teachers regarding the inconsistency of the remuneration that they have been paid over the years. They were given contracts and I think the honourable Member would be very much aware with the stated salary of $14,000 that they will be entitled to. Unfortunately, the ECE teachers are paid hourly rate of $5. They work five hours a day and sometimes their salary amounts to only $9,000. So, these are the discrepancies that we are trying to work on, for us to review the hours of work, if they work the full eight hours so that they can be entitled to what they are actually appointed on, on a salary of $14,000. Thank you very much Mr, Speaker, Sir. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question. Before that, there might be new question but if the Minister can answer; if we are talking about ECE children, proceed from ECE. MR. SPEAKER.- I will decide on that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2225 (Laughter) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- If students going from ECE to primary school, ECE being the feeder of primary school and primary school being the feeder of the secondary schools, what we have seen recently is some management are coming up with their own rules whereby Year 8 students are not taken into the same school for Year 9 as a feeder. I will give you an example. MGM Primary are rejecting students from Year 8 to be enrolled in Year 9 and they telling them to go and look for their schools on median marks. If the Ministry can look into this because parents are having a lot of difficulties also. The same applies for ECE. If the feeder is ECE for primary school, they are not enrolling these students and parents are roaming around from here and there to look for their schools and we have live examples of this, if the Minister can look into this, please. MR. SPEAKER.- They roam around looking for schools?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, that is a totally new question, but I would like to shed some light into the education situation that we have now. We have over 700 plus primary schools, and we only have 170 plus secondary schools. Definitely, there is imbalance there that we are trying to address by even building new schools, trying to address students going to find the schools that provide better quality education. At the same time, they are leaving the schools in the rural and maritime areas vacant or empty, because the people are coming into town, and we are going to address that. Thank you. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Thank you, honourable Minister. There is an estimated of 1,500 ECE teachers, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the people have been affected by the VAT increase. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> Of course they have been affected, we agree.</p><p>Honourable Minister for Employment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is relevant because 80 percent of his speech is about international things, nothing about local employment. To the Honourable Minister for Education, I have high hopes from you that if the salary of these ECE teachers could see an increment in time to come, and if there was any impact assessment done through a feedback question mechanism, or clarification on the impact of the Cost of Living that has increased. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the short answer to that is, we are trying to address the anomalies in the pays that are currently being paid out to ECE teachers. This was inherited. I think the honourable Member who asked the question would be fully aware, and that is what we are trying to address now, trying to give them what were actually offered in the first place with the proper working hours. MOU - Risk Communication Capacity (Question No. 186/2023) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>2226</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 the Memorandum of Understanding to Enhance Risk Communication Capacity for the Ministry? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Sir, on 3 rd October, 2023, Cabinet endorsed the Ministry of Health to engage with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for opportunities to build risk communication capacity in the Ministry. Just as the honourable Prime Minister had mentioned in celebrating the Thanksgiving Day, we are also thankful to the US Government in terms of increasing their capacity at the USAID Department - the Ministry’s to seek their assistance with regards to risk communications. Mr. Speaker, Sir, risk communication is important in the public health response tool, sure the previous Government know this too well. Its main purpose is to enable people at least to make informed decisions to take actions to mitigate the effects of health threat or hazard such as disease outbreak and proactive measures and preventative measures, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services Communication team has commenced consultation with our USAID counterparts and the details of their assistance with the Ministry. The visit by the USAID Team is planned in February next year to conduct the Needs Assessment Survey and also handover much-needed communication equipment. The MOU between the Ministry and the USAID has been drafted and contains assistance sought from USAID through its action portfolio which is their funded global social behavioural change project. The list of activities are the needs assessment which I have alluded to earlier in 2024, capacity building for staff of the Ministry and developing communications, plan, campaigns and communication materials, virtual coaching on developing communication materials, website enhancement training and provision of communication equipment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently draft MOU is now with the USAID Team for their consideration and final endorsement, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Sir, that in itself is a brief update on the current MOU between the Ministry of Health and USAID on the understanding on enhance risk communication capacity. Vinaka. Update on Review of Market Fees (Question No. 187/2023) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: Given that the market fees review for market vendors and farmers was announced in the 2023-2024 Budget, can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the status of the review? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question, first, I would like to respond to a remark that was made in the morning by the honourable Leader of the Opposition regarding the upkeep of Albert Park. I wish to remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition as well as honourable Members of Parliament that there is no change to the maintenance programme that is followed by the Suva City Council, whatever has been done in the past they are continuing with that, that is going to continue, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- I played touch rugby there last year and this year:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> A good example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are here for the last two</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2227 days, the ground was closed. It seems that Suva City Council was trying to maintain the surface, as well as the upkeep of Albert Park.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Deep holes are there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, now I will respond to the question before me this afternoon. Firstly, I would like to remind the honourable Member that the 2022-2023 Budget does not mention the market reviews for market vendors and farmers, but rather reinstated the waiver of the market stall fees, I suppose as COVID-19 recovery strategy. The reinstatement is the consideration of the successful navigation of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that we are now on the path to recovery. This is also to ease the Coalition Government as we now work on the national priorities and commitments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Government provided a sum of approximate $10.5 million in the form of financial support to Municipal Councils for the waiver of the market stall fees for the last two financial years. The waiver was provided in the financial years from 2021 to 2022, as well as 2022 to 2023. However, there was a shortfall from the grant that was provided by Government. In 2021 to 2022, there was a shortfall of close to $55,000, which is a short fall of 11 precent and $1.2 million in the financial year 2022 to 2023, which is a shortfall of close to 19 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the market stall fee subsidy was allocated to 13 Municipal Councils initially, the amounts allocated was insufficient to pay all the dues on the market stalls. Not all the Councils were provided with the actual amount of funds that they would have collected from the market vendors in all the municipal markets. As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry requested for a reinstatement of market stall fees to allow Councils to collect fees to focus on strengthening their revenue stream. All Municipal Councils around the country have been challenged to manage their affairs from business perspective and not relying solely on Government on the provision of grant to assist them in their operation. As such, the budget for the financial year 2023-2024 does not make any provision for the subsidy on the market stall fees for this fiscal year. Municipal Councils have now reinstated the market stall fees from this financial year and are collecting the same. There is no review, they are just collecting whatever the gazetted fees say for all the municipal markets around the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the significance of the market stall fees revenue and sustaining operations and development of municipality, the Councils have been prompted to take actions to ensure the collection of their revenue. Since the announcement of the reinstatement of stall fees, Municipal Councils have been advised to ensure that market stall vendors resume payment of their respective fees as at 1 st August, 2023. The existing fee structure, as outlined in the previous years, remain in effect to allow the Councils to make appropriate submissions if there is a need for review of the market fees for all the Municipalities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, Municipal Councils have been directed to establish a mechanism to efficiently collect these fees and maintain accurate record of the transactions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $1.675 million has been collected by the 13 Councils in the last quarter from August to October this year. This is the much-needed revenue for the Local Government that will assist Municipal Councils to enhance their operations and service delivery for the benefit of the market vendors, ratepayers and the community at large.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>2228</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government, through Municipal Councils, will ensure that ratepayers and various communities continue to receive the service that they deserve. Needless to say, the Municipal Councils will be motivated to build the cities and towns with the aim to generate multiple activities and innovative development of infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, UN Women has provided funding assistance to the Ministry for the review of the bylaws and the development of the new Municipal Market regulations, considering the changing demands of the markets, market vendors, Municipal Councils and the public at large. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funding provided by UN Women is in the sum of FJ$89,600. This will cover the market consultancy and awareness during the review exercise. It is also worth noting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the assistance will focus on the consultative process of the revision of market bylaws of the Municipal Councils to ensure that regulations are established. As such, the Ministry in partnership with UN Women, has appointed a consultant to carry out the review exercise and draft market regulations that will be a standard regulation to be used by the 30 Municipal Councils. As we speak, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go around Municipal Councils in Fiji, they have different market bylaws for different markets, and that is something that we are trying to address now. There are cases where some of the produce that are not supposed to be sold in some of the local markets that we have are now being sold. It is just like you are walking into a mini supermarket. There are also cases where some market vendors have been allocated more than two or more than four stalls, some even have 20 stalls, so that is something that we are trying to address right now. The role of the consultant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to provide guidance to the Ministry of Local Government in developing Municipal Market regulations which would replace the market bylaws. Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the review and consultation with the Office of the Solicitor- General, the Ministry will facilitate the formalisation of the regulations. The consultancy fee for the review is in the sum of FJ$40,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of funding an agreement with Ministry and UN Women is also to develop materials and awareness programmes. Awareness material will be a simplified market regulation that will be displayed in all 13 Municipal Markets. The Ministry of Local Government in collaboration with UN Women endeavours to complete the project before the end of the financial year. I thank you, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to the question before this august Parliament this afternoon. Thank you very much. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister has informed Parliament, he has reinstated the fees for the market vendors and farmers. Sir, what a Government! The people’s Government! Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be welcomed by the Coalition Government to come into Parliament and brag about putting money into people’s pocket, but here they are bragging about their collections. To the so-called people’s Government, honourable Minister, do you have any exemptions on any reduction for any smallholder vendors because remember, cyclones came, COVID-19 came and these were really affected? Mr. Speaker, Sir, these were really affected but the VAT increase has</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2229 really impacted our people, especially these vendors. So, are there any exemptions to be considered for these vendors? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, if you have been following the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s announcement just lately, they have stated that Fiji is now back to pre-COVID-19 level and if you happen to walk around all the Municipal Markets, you will see that a lot of produce are now being sold in all the markets. To answer his question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just said that the Ministry is on the verge of reviewing the market bylaws and that some of that, we want to do right now, so those are some of the things that we are going to consider. There will be cases where some vendors that will be affected may be due to something that must have affected them. VAT increase is not something new. What I have just is not back to pre-COVID-19. A lot of things are happening now. A lot of people are buying from the market. A lot of market vendors are now receiving more income as they used to do before, so that is something that the Ministry is considering of doing as we review the Market Bylaws. Establishment of the Scam Taskforce (Question No. 188/2023) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the establishment of the Scam Taskforce on online fraudulent activities and its future plans? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thank the honourable Tunabuna for a very relevant and topical question in the country right now. Perhaps, before I venture into my question, there were some questions made over the last 24 hours that warrant some mention. I would like start with, to me, what was a very significant event yesterday. Sir, yesterday, on this floor, the honourable Leader of the Opposition begged the honourable Prime Minister to attend COP 28 and the honourable Prime Minister agreed, virtually immediately, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hope Fiji watch that gesture yesterday, Sir, because it is showing a very important point, a point that all of us in this Parliament, including the whole country, will learn that one key element of leadership is the ability to listen, and when it is right, act on it. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 16 years… HON. S. D. TURAGA.- No! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- E sega, e warai. So, I hope that the people of Fiji will take note that we have a Leader who actually listens. A couple of other points, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Bala mentioned something about empty vessels yesterday. So, I thought just to match his quote, I would provide a quote from this side of Parliament just in the spirit of banter and politics. It is a quote from Abraham Lincoln, the former President of the United States, where he said, and I quote: “It is best to be quiet and be thought a fool or to speak out and remove all doubt.” (Laughter) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, the final point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir,</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>2230</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 is about honourable Bala and maybe this is picking on his speech.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> If you continue to speak, you’ll remove all doubt.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> He, in responding, was asked, “Did you travel to see the workers offshore? I think he did not answer that question, which brings me to a very important point, Sir. What was the motivation of his Government in terms of the…. HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, please, answer the question. MR. SPEAKER.- You raised a Point of Order and you are telling him to answer the question? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will leave my point on honourable Bala for another day, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to answer the question. The Scam Taskforce was actually established this year by Government in response to quite significant and concerning online fraudulent activities that happened in this country. It is very unfortunate that Fiji has had a history of scams over the years, such as the gifting pyramid schemes, now the e-Bay shop scheme, bitcoin and cryptocurrency, impersonation to obtain financial advantage through Viber, et cetera. The failed e-Bay shop scam has left many people struggling, with hundreds of people losing thousands of dollars in a scheme that provided zero returns once it collapsed. E-Bay shop was essentially a pyramid scheme disguised as a recruitment agency. They had over a hundred agents, recruiting people into the scheme across all Divisions in Fiji. In response, the Fiji Police Force also established the taskforce in each Division to ascertain the severity of the matter. The Consumer Council of Fiji, Fijian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (FCCC), the Consumer Commission and other agencies pleaded to the public to come forward and report the matter to enable comprehensive investigation to proceed. Thus far, the Taskforce has received over 1,859 complaints as of 31 st October, 2023. It is understood that the people have been taken in for questioning and we hope for an outcome soon, given that the e-Bay online recruitment scam is of national interest, noting the millions of dollars that have been lost by the public actively participating in this online scheme. The total value of reported losses todate is $3.1 million. There is, no doubt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the rise in technology and the use of e-commerce platforms are being misused. It is still new and not fully utilised in Fiji and the Pacific countries, hence it is not fully regulated. Such examples, such as mobile wallets - M-PAiSA and MyCash, are becoming increasingly popular tools for cashless payments and money transfer. There is a need, Sir, to review existing regulations and identify gaps to safeguard consumer protection. That is one of the current new priorities of the Ministry and the People’s Coalition Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, the Taskforce has their hands full to also assess, review, monitor online fraudulent activities both, locally and abroad, ensuring there is no money leakages offshore. It is important to note that continuous advocating against fraudulent activities through various media platforms are being made by members of the taskforce. The Taskforce may or will declare an online activity as a scam after an assessment of the Taskforce, assigning members to take necessary action where applicable.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2231 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Taskforce at the moment, comprises of the following agencies, the: 1. Ministry of Trade; 2. Fiji Police Force; 3. Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission; 4. Consumer Council of Fiji; 5. Online Safety Commission; 6. 7. Reserve Bank of Fiji; and Solicitor-General. The Chairperson of the taskforce is generally the Minister for Trade (myself) or the Permanent Secretary. The Taskforce has the ability to co-opt members, such as the Financial Intelligence Unit, commercial banks and telecom service providers, such as Vodafone or Digicel, as required. Thus far, we have had three meetings on the online scams – e-Bay Shop and Viber impersonations are key issues at the moment. Impersonators would defraud family, friends, business executives using MPAiSA or MyCash platforms to deceive innocent people. What are the future plans, Mr. Speaker, Sir? In our Taskforce meetings, we have invited the two major operators, Vodafone and Digicel to seek their support to nurture and create awareness on the ongoing scams that are involving the use of e-wallets. Most importantly to hear the activities in providing more secure platforms, programmes and initiatives to create more awareness of devious transactions and scams. It is unfortunate that whilst Fiji aims to develop our digital economy, it is being misused and it does build mistrust amongst us all; this is unacceptable. Sadly, during our taskforce meetings, it was revealed that a new way of scamming through Viber accounts as I had mentioned is currently underway where accounts are being hacked, whereby the hacker will try and obtain money from one’s own contacts. This type of new impersonation is happening right now, and our taskforce has received a lot of reports and complaints. Alarms are being sounded and we urge people to take this very seriously. In addition, the FCCC, the Consumer Council, RBF are collaborating with a digital solutions provider to provide a proactive approach to awareness and educating the public on online scams. They will be publicising their awareness material very soon. We have made it a top priority, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to bring justice to those involved in the scam to be taken to task. Furthermore, we will be undertaking more awareness programmes to educate the public so that they do not fall into such scams in the future. In the medium to long term, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the taskforce is also looking at the existing laws to give consumer protection agencies more teeth. Can I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the government over the last 16 years had seen these scams before and did absolutely nothing. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- This is a government that is full of talk, a lot of hot air, again no action.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just like you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Through this august Parliament, I call on the beloved Fijians to take great awareness in the use of various social media sites as there have been high reports of fraudulent activities originating from social media sites promising get rich quick schemes. I therefore urge the public to practice financial awareness when coming across such schemes and prevent themselves from falling victim to these kind of ventures.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>2232</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 In very simple terms, Sir, if someone comes to you and says, “your money is going to grow 50 percent or 100 percent” my advice to the public, run for the hills. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to answer the question. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his detailed explanation but not his meanderings. My question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs has had discussions on this matter. I just wanted to ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister if there has been communications with the two mobile service providers because it seems to us as a Committee that they are also taking advantage because it is business for them on the money transfer that has been created as they collect fees out of it. I just wanted clarification on that, please. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question. Let us not forget Digicel and Vodafone are actually regulated by the RBF so there is no way they would jeopardise their licences. They have responded when there has been invitations for them to come and attend the taskforce, they have been quite transparent in terms of their explanations, and they are actively assisting the Police to actually try and find out the perpetrators. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question. I had alluded to this in one of my statements the other day. It has to do with the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. When we ratify that Convention, we partner with these countries that are leading the fight on cybercrime. Do you know if we are going to ratify, given that Treaty has gone through the whole process? It came to the Standing Committee on the Foreign Affairs and Defence, and we brought it back to Parliament. Do you know if we are going to ratify and sign it? Those people who are doing the online scams, if you catch them, there is the Cybercrime Act in Fiji that you are going to perhaps use to convict them and that was put in place by the previous government. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously if they are found to be guilty, they will be prosecuted. At the moment the police is still doing their investigations. On the Budapest Convention, we are working hard to actually get something before Cabinet to actually ratify the Convention. There is only another piece of consultation that needs to happen with the stakeholders, and as soon as that happens we will be tabling it with Cabinet. I am hoping to do that in the first quarter of next year. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification. If the two mobile companies are regulated by RBF, then what is Telecommunication Authority of Fiji doing? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, she has been the Minister of Trade but probably is not familiar with the machinations. Telecom does not operate mobile wallets, so they are not regulated by the RBF. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- They are not regulated by the RBF? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, so they are not accountable, they do not have a discussion point to make in the conversation about e-Bay and whatever, because that involves the mobile network. It does not involve Telecom. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Can you confirm whether RBF is regulating these two mobile companies?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Of course:</span></p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2233 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- It is very important to understand, because I know there are many financial institutions which are not regulated by the RBF till now, for example, Pacific Finance is not regulated by RBF. That is coming as a … HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act stipulates very clearly who gets regulated under the financial system. The mobile operators have to be regulated because they are taking deposits from the people of Fiji so they have the laws that actually regulate them. Then you have the banks that have certain regulations. In order to get the mobile wallet, they need to get RBF approval. They cannot do it without RBF. I am not sure what you learnt when you were there for 16 years. Update on Waste Management and Disposal Practices (Question No. 189/2023) HON. K. K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the current state of waste management and disposal practices in our communities that used to be covered by Rural Local Authorities? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Member for the question raised. Waste management in Fiji, indeed, is a critical issue. The reason why this is very important is because this is brought about by exacerbated rate of urban drift, population growth, the changes in lifestyle that have led to surge in waste generation. The burden is particularly heavier on municipal councils grappling the challenges of proper solid waste management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as outlined in the Local Government Act 1972 the municipalities bear the responsibility for solid waste management. However, they face a barrage of issues including illegal dumping, damaged communal containers and resistance to service charges. In the rural areas, the disposal of solid waste is often buried or through burning. The municipal councils were given the responsibility for solid waste management, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in extended areas a duty previously overseen by Rural Local Authority since 2018. Despite the challenges, the Councils are now servicing 234 settlements and villages in these extended boundaries. For the current fiscal year 2023-2024, an allocation of $2.2 million has been designated to address solid waste management in the extended areas. The Ministry of Local Government has been providing consistent support offering government grants and technical assistance from JICA to manage solid waste effectively. Over the past three years, the council had collected 120.8 tonnes of waste in these areas with the government contributing $10.6 million towards waste disposal efforts. Additional support include government subsidies, the purchase of garbage trucks in collaboration with JICA for technical assistance and the formulation of a solid waste masterplan. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the pursuit of sustainable practices, councils are engaging in waste segregation at source, composting green waste and assisting villages in communal heat excavation within the delegated areas. This approach plays a pivotal role in extending the lifespan of landfills. To further enhance solid waste management, the Ministry in collaboration with municipal councils has initiated a partnership with the Pacific Recycling Foundation to establish mini-waste recycling centres. The centres situated in various locations aim to address waste issues in informal settlements and promote recycling. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to acknowledge that councils provide waste collection services</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>2234</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 to informal settlements without monetary compensation or it is free of charge to the informal settlements. The waste collection subsidy helps offset the cost and the councils are actively working to reduce ongoing expenses by procuring fleet and equipment and adopting inhouse services to replace costly outsourcing. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative to highlight that the Ministry is actively collaborating with esteemed developed partners like KOICA and UNDP to undertake the crucial task of rehabilitating specific dumpsites across Viti Levu, particularly those encroaching on the coastal areas. This is a challenge for the Ministry right now; to rehabilitate and even move some of the existing landfills and dumping sites that we currently have. Furthermore, the Ministry is orchestrating a collaborative effort involving key agencies such as the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change Unit, Ministry of Finance, UNDP and KOICA to spearhead the legislative reforms. These reforms are geared toward instituting mandatory ways of sorting at the source and ensuring effective management at dumpsite and landfill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the formidable challenges faced, municipal councils are unwavering in their commitment to delivering efficient services to their delegated areas. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, a very simple question. In accordance or to be aligned with the SDGs of responsible consumption, production and sustainable citizen communities, does the Ministry have any future plans to generate renewable energy and fertilisers from the disposal practices of this waste for cleaner cities in Fiji, healthier soil and greener farms? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question. If you have been to or if you have a chance to visit Lautoka Dump Site, they now have a compost site where all the green waste are dumped in a particular area. As we speak, they do collect the compost, it can be termed as very good manure and fertilisers. In one of my last visits to Vunato Rubbish Dump, they have even been selling the green waste or the compost to the public. That is something that we are also exploring right now. As part of the reforms that we are undertaking right now, because if you go to countries like Singapore, they are converting waste to energy. So, these are some of the ways that we are reviewing right now and trying to ensure that when we try and resolve waste management system, we also look at the more effective and more climate friendly ways of disposing waste in our country. MR. SPEAKER.- This question to be redirected to the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts. Restoration of Levuka Heritage Site (Question No. 190/2023) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts inform Parliament on the steps being undertaken in partnership with World Heritage Fund to restore the heritage sites damaged during TC Winston in 2016 at Levuka? HON. I. VASU.- I thank the honourable Member for the questions. I understand the town of Levuka has been wondering where will they get the assistance when they get listed, who will be helping them, whether it is the Government, World Heritage or National Trust? But when I brief you this afternoon, you will see that World Heritage does not have that much to offer when towns are</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2235 listed as World Heritage Listing and also the Government does not allocate much from 2013 to-date. So, that must be why they were wondering as to who is there to help them. I understand in our last sitting we were discussing about the Heritage Bill and to help the people of Levuka, we need to pass the Heritage Bill. In regards to the policy for the heritage site in Levuka, they can process it. The trust be formed so that funds can be allocated to that trust and they can help with the restoration of those old properties in Levuka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1990 Fiji became a signatory to the 1992 World Heritage Convention and it is eligible to apply for the World Heritage Fund. The Fund is used for world heritage sites international assistance and also fund advisory bodies. The status allows Fiji to pay the World Heritage Fund an annual contribution of US$134. The Fund is used for world heritage sites international assistance and to fund advisory bodies. The World Heritage is paid out under these categories: • • • preparatory work up to US$30,000; emergency assistance up to US$75,000; and conservation and management assistance up to US$10,000. In addition to that, they can also assist with: • • • technical corporations the sum of US$10,000; training and research, the sum of US$10,000; and promotion and education assistance the sum of US$30,000. I am glad to report that the World Heritage Fund assisted Fiji with about US$44,500 from 2003 to 2008 to fund the Heritage Port Town of Levuka before it was listed in 2013 as the World Heritage Site. The breakdown of this Fund is as follows: • 12 th August, 2003 - a comparative analysis study for Levuka was approved with given US$10,000; • March 2004 - the World Heritage Stakeholders Consultations we were given • US$19,500; and 25 th March, 2008 - the development of Legislative Protections for the Conservation of Heritage in Levuka of a management plan we were given US$15,000. In 2016 (three years after the listing of Levuka Town as the World Heritage Site) the devastating TC Winston hit Fiji and did not spare Levuka Town. Mr. Speaker, UNESCO assisted Fiji by sending two built heritage technical experts to organise a rapid assessment report on the effects of TC Winston on Levuka. Their response was included in the 2016 TC Winston post-disaster needs assessment report and this was completed in May 2016. The World Heritage Rapid Assessment Report was presented to the post-disaster need assessment working group for the Culture Sector which was set up by Government. It was the first time that Government had recognised the urgency to include its PDNA (a survey of cultural heritage resource) that was damaged during TC Winston. According to the TC Winston PDNA Report, the summary of the combined value for the damage and losses for the cultural sector in Fiji was Culture and Heritage Sector was $5.9 million, World Heritage Site in Levuka was $4.38 million. A total recovery and reconstruction need for the cultural sector during TC Winston was $9.1 million.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2236</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, the World Heritage Funding only cater for the technical corporation training and research assistance. However, it does not include financial assistance to restore damage to the Levuka Heritage structure. The timeline for the heritage funding for any purpose is from January to March each year. As the deadline for the submissions was March 2016 the PDNA report was endorsed in May which was too late. Two months after the approval window which mean we missed out on that opportunity. In 2017 while there was an opportunity to make the submission to the World Heritage however the Fiji Government decided to have a structural assessment done first for Levuka World Heritage structure. This was conducted between 2017 and 2018. The structural assessment was fully funded by the Government with the budget of $0.6 million. Based on the TC Winston PDNA Report the Government had provisions of assisting some homeowners in the historic port of the town of Levuka with the urgent restoration work after TC Winston. Mr. Speaker, to answer the honourable Member’s question the World Heritage contribution for TC Winton came in the form of two experts who conducted the rapid assessment. The previous Government had allocated $1.5 million for its restoration of the Levuka Community Centres Project from the 2023-2024 budgetary allocation. Mr. Speaker, I understand we have overlooked the Town of Levuka for too long. We will try our outmost best to try and help and carry out the process to work with World Heritage and make sure we work with the Town of Levuka, our National Trust and the iTaukei Affairs so that we can move the project forward. Vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Members. We are probably just waiting for another Winston.
