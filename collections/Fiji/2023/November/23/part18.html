<body><h3>EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 21 st November, 2023, I move: That the Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 27/2023), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled on Tuesday 21 st of November, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Employment Relations Act 2007, as I had mentioned on Tuesday, had been the subject of much expressed concern in relation to the compliance of International Labour Standards and this Bill is just the beginning of the work that this Government seeks to carry out in order to upgrade Fiji’s compliance level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not about following whatever the international world tells us to do as</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 2249 honourable Usamate would like us to believe but about doing what should have been done a long time ago, that is precisely why this is so urgent. According to the International Labour Organisation, the employment relationship is the legal link between employers and employees. This relationship exists when a person performs work or services for his or her employer under certain conditions in return for remuneration or payment of the work or service. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this legal framework the rights and obligations are created as well as the application of labour law provisions. The main purpose of amending the definition of essential services and industries in Section 185 of the Act is to revert the list of essential services back to the original definition of essential services as contained in Schedule Seven, and to bring Fiji’s list of essential services in compliance with ILO Convention No. 87 being “the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948”. Fiji ratified this Convention on 17 th April, 2002 (that is more than 20 years ago). In 201l the Essential National Industries Employment Decree 2011 and the Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011 made amendments with significantly impacted works freedom of association and the ability to bargain collectively. Example of such provisions in the 2011 legislative amendments were that all pre-existing collective agreements were terminated within 60 days after the commencement day of the decree. The re-registration was required of every union, pending employment related disputes and grievances and litigations were terminated and employment disputes were referred to compulsory arbitration by the Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations with no right of appeal. Rather than unions have recourse to the Employment Relations Tribunal and the Employment Relations Courts. The ENI Regulations widen the scope of essential industries in Schedule Seven of the Act to include financial industry, telecommunication industry, civil aviation industry and the public utilities industry. Mr. Speaker, there was widespread criticism of the ENI decree and ENI regulations by Fiji Unions including; the Fiji Trade Union Congress, the Fiji Island Council of Trade Unions and internationally by the International Trade Unions Confederation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Commonwealth Trade Union Group, the ILO Committee of Experts on the application of Conventions in its observations of the Convention 87 of 2012 urge the Fiji Government to take the necessary measure to amend the ENI decree without delay in full consultations with the social partners so is to bring in conformity with Convention No. 87. In 2013, two sets of regulations under the ENI decree were passed to extend the coverage of ENI decree which increased the number of industries and entities that were designated as essential services, to include the FNPF, Airports Fiji Limited, Pine and Mahogany Industries (that is including Tropik Wood and Fiji Hardwood), Fire Prevention Services Industry including the National Fire Authority and Local Governments including all towns and city councils in Fiji. In 2015, the ENI Decree was appealed the new Part 19 was inserted in the Act. This new Part 19 read, and I quote, “it introduced a new interpretation provisions in Section 185 which define ‘essential service and industry’ to include government, statutory authority, local authority, a government commercial company as prescribed under the Public Enterprise Act of 1996.” Under the definition in Section 185 included those essential, national industries declared and designated cooperations or designated companies, designated under the ENI Decree and an extended application of the Act to such industries and workers. These preserve the extended list of industries designated as essential services. It also introduced a new system for collective bargaining and employer union dispute resolution in those</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>2250 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 corporations and services and establish a new Arbitration Court to decide on trade disputes in essential national industries and services. The effect of amending the definition of essential service industry, will be, to remove the extended list of categories of essential service industries which were designated under the ENI Decree. Following the Amendment, the current list of essential services contain in Schedule 7, only will be Fiji’s list of essential services and any such other services, part of those listed, provided if, and only if, designated by the Minister. In terms of consultation, the Ministry had consulted with ERAB Sub-Committee in relation to the ERA Matrix in February and September as articulated by the Ministry of Employment this morning. The Ministry has also held consultations with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning and National Development and Statistics, the Ministry of Civil Service, Office of the Solicitor-General and the Ministry of Local Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I just touch on a few clauses on the Bill. Clause 1 of the Employment Relations Amendment Bill 2023 makes provision for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, the amending legislation will come into force on a date or date(s) appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette. Clause 2 of the Bill, amends Section 185 of the Act by introducing a new definition for essential services and industry or essential services and industries, in order to revert to the original list of essential services in Schedule 7, by deleting reference to essential national industries designated under the ENI Decree. A new definition provides that additional essential services industries maybe designated after the date of commencement of the amended legislation and may include a service which is part of a listed entities, service providers, including services provided by the Government. Clause 3 of the Bill (Amends) Section 188 of the Act, to increase the time limit of workers in essential service to lodge or file employment grievances from 21 days to six months, the date on which a grievance first arose. A new time limit for filing of employment grievance does not have retrospective effect and only applies to actions filed after the date of commencement of the amending legislation. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I have a list of four speakers, provided by the Whips. A batting will be led off by honourable Maharaj, then to be followed by the honourable Minister Agni Deo Singh and if we have time we will follow on by honourable Jone Usamate before it is rounded off by honourable Minister Vosarogo. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have here before us a Bill that has two clauses, or particularly three, I would say. Members have been harping all along about the suppression of employees’ rights. Ever since 2007 ERA got into place. A lot of talks were there that, employees’ rights are supressed, this, that, blah, blah, blah.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is a fact:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> We went with so many changes, 2015 an amendment was brought in, it was brought under 51, no doubt in that, but it was given to the Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. They went for a public consultation, they had some amendments to be done, they</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 2251 made those amendments, it was brought back to Parliament in July 2015 where it was debated and passed. Even after that ILO did not have any issues with the particular ERA that is, that was available in the form of what it is today, yes, honourable Professor Prasad. When people go to elections with this kind of agenda this is what actually happens. We need to change to show people something, what are we changing in this, Mr. Speaker, Sir? What kind of suppression was there that we have to change and bring these three clauses that now all these people....</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> The 21 days.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> All the employers of Fiji basically only 30 percent out of more than 3,090 employees are unionised. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Only 30 percent by now the number would have decreased, Mr.</p><p>Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Gosh:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- But just because someone has gone out there and promised to their...:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- With most genuine reason:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.-..:</span> voters that we will actually remove it, they need to bring in something and there is no such thing to this particular Bill. There was no restriction that industries that are part of essential industries as per the Act they cannot go on strike, they can, all that was required was to give a 28 days’ notice.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA:</span> You give the permit? No permit.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Did anyone apply?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Did anyone apply?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We applied:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> To go on strike? (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- If you want to go on strike ..:</span></p><p>(Chorus interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Shameema Ali is crying:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>2252 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a developing nation. Even if ILO agreed that the essential industries may defer from countries to countries. In Fiji we are a tourism-based GDP over here, Mr. Speaker. Our economy is depended on tourism, so in Fiji’s context the tourism sector, airport, Fiji Airways, Aviation industry they are very essential set out, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Simple ..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- People willing to come to Fiji we cannot actually expect pilots to be going on strike without notice. The employers..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are requesting the union..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ- Oh come on:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is the truth:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, as I say we are a developing nation.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- We are a developing nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to have tailor-made essential industries.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Listen:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Stands for Elections:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, there seems to be a lot of running commentary going on. Just listen, continue. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with ILO there were only two issues with our ERA before amendments in 2015 and that was collecting bargaining and if the essential industries, employees, could actually associate with other unions and 2015 Amendments of the Act allow that. That is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was stating when we actually go and do false promises to the voters we will come back and do such kind of changes to the Act...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Nonsense:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Which will affect the nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no suppression of what they are actually changing, will not reflect that the suppression will be removed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these contributions I do not support the Amendment that is before us. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite not only surprised, but shocked at honourable Maharaj’s statement. He was the former Assistant Minister and he would have read the reports from ILO. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ILO has been the Committee on application of standards has been beseeching Fiji year after year, after 2015 (2018 and 2019) to correct the essential industries list, to</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 2253 restore the rights of all those workers who are not in essential services. I would invite him to go back and read those reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should also be aware that 2019 Direct Contact Mission is still pending and is due here on the invitation of our Government now, either in December or in January, to see the progress of where we are with the amendment of the Employment Relations Act. There are so many comments that are there regarding workers’ rights that have been breached through these amendments that were carried out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2007 all was fine until 2011 everything was fine, no one complained because the law was catering for everyone’s rights. It was only when they started tinkering with this in 2011 as an interim regime, where no one had any right to protest or oppose, and if they did, you know what happened. That is when it started. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying that this side of Parliament, who genuinely believe in true democracy, empowerment of our people and restoring the rights of all workers whole- heartedly support the Bill before us. The struggle of the workers and their leaders to ensure justice, fair play and equality is now finally becoming a reality after the harrowing experience of 16 years of suppression by a dictatorship that did not give a dam about the rights and freedom of the workers. This is despite the fact that Fiji had ratified the fundamental Conventions as alluded to by the honourable Attorney-General. I do not want to repeat all that, I have said it quite a number of times in this Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, simply, the assault on the rights and freedom of workers began just after December, a little after 2007, executed by a regime and later a government, although democratically elected, unable to shirk its dictatorial traits. This is despite the fact that Fiji had well before that ratified the fundamental Conventions that I had just pointed out. We all know that Essential National Industries Decree 2011 later largely incorporated into the Employment Relations Act 2015, with some cosmetic changes in 2016 to try and avoid the ILO Direct Contact Mission or Commission of Inquiry, which was…. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I will ask you to sit down since the bell has been sounded so I can provide another speakers to stand up and make their contribution. When the bell is sounded too, it will go to the next speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Thank you very much, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I think it would be better to listen to me after listening to all that hot air. (Laughter) This Bill basically talks about two things. Let me school everyone, the Bill talks about two things: 1. Reverting the definition of Essential National Industries. 2. Those are subject to the processes in the Essential National Industries that …. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is not!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hang on! It is my time now, you can have your time later.</p><p>The amount of time that they have for grievances to register grievances was changed from 21</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2254 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 days to six months. That is the issue. Now, Essential National Industries, this is how it is defined in the very Bill that the honourable Attorney-General has provided. Let me revert to these notes, probably better. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Hold on! Hold your horse! Anything that may endanger life, personal safety, health of the whole or part of the population. Now in any country in the world, the way we define this will also depend on our context. We do not just take willy-nilly the definitions provided by someone else where you have the interest of your country at heart, you take the Convention, we sign on the Convention but your most important interest is the interest of your country. So, we define that in the context of our country. At that particular point in time it was decided to define that in the interest of making sure that the economy of this country kept on improving, while we still look after the interest of all workers in this country and that is what happened, honourable Attorney-General. We do not kowtow to all these people that have power around the world. We do not do that. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- You know that there are countries in the world that condemn Fiji in Geneva but they themselves have not ratified Convention 87. They have not ratified this and they shout all these accusations at us. We have the right as a sovereign country of our own. We ratified the Conventions and 87 in its definition allows us some leeway to define it according to our context and that is what we did and what resulted from that? We still look after all of our workers and at the same time our economy expanded. And as our economy expanded, we are able to invest in roads, welfare, education, assistance for electricity and all of those things benefited those very same workers and provided immediate direct benefits. Their children were able to go to school without having to pay fares. That is happening because we are expanding the economy. So, it was done in the context of what we have here in this country. We did not, we allowed, people could still strike, they could go through the processes. The process was slightly changed but they feel their freedom of association was preserved, their freedom of association to join unions and to take action was still preserved. So, that is very important. We do not kowtow. There was some time ago when the former Prime Minister used to sit here, used to fight for climate change. He would go to these countries and call them the “coalition of the selfish and if they did something about fossil fuel, even though they were very good friends, he would have the guts to tell them, “You are the coalition of the selfish” because he stood by the interest of this country first rather than kowtowing to anyone all over the world in the international arena. That is the very important thing that we have to remember. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hang on, hang on! Hold your horse.</p><p>The other part, the best interest of Fiji, I would appeal to the Minister, these things that you are talking about only affects 30 percent of the workforce of this country.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 2255 (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, 70 percent are not catered for. They are not represented. These trade unionists that are running around, who are talking about these things, they do not look after people in the security companies. Most the complaints in these ministries are about workers security companies suffering today. As we sit here, they suffer. People in the informal sector are exploited. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- What did you do? HON. J. USAMATE.- I was there doing it. That is the interest of today. That is what you need to focus on. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you resume your seat.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Thank you very much, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker for the opportunity to address Parliament in relation to this Bill. Mr. Speaker, the amendment that we are seeking or the Bill seeks to introduce to the House is a modest adjustment but it comes with a lot of goodwill. It involves a lot of benefits also by what it would attract to our shores simply by the fact that we are going to comply with our ILO obligations. Now, the honourable Leader of Opposition has been talking about relevance in the world stage. Honourable Usamate had been harping on this week about punching above our weights at global forums. This is an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for Fiji to comply and become a bona fide compliant member of ILO. That is where we punch above our lines. That is where we become relevant at the international forums. This amendment, Mr. Speaker, has been discussed with stakeholders. The honourable Maharaj had spoken about the amendment that they brought in 2015. What he did not inform this Chamber is prior to that one amendment, there were nine other amendments that were done, all without prior consultation. Go and read the law. Some were done by promulgation, some were done by Decrees and some were done by Standing Order 51. What is important about this one, Mr. Speaker, is if you ask the unions, employers association, workers, Ministry, how many of those amendments, the 10 amendments that have happened to this law in the past 10 years have they been consulted with? Zero. The only one that they have said is the one in 2015. For this one, Mr. Speaker, we have consulted the unions, workers’ representatives, employers and the workers in a forum, Mr. Speaker, that the FijiFirst Government had laid to rest many years ago; the tripartite. That is how we were able to obtain the views of everyone who was concerned about this amendment, their views had been obtained in leading up to the introduction of this Bill. In the tripartite, the very forum that you buried together with your attempt to supress workers’ rights. Together with that, you lost their good will, you lost their bona fide, you lost their trust and you lost their votes. Mr. Speaker, the Coalition Government is doing exactly what it promised it will do. It will revive people’s participation in their government and through the revival of the tripartite, both in intent and with good deeds, we are delivering that to the workers of this nation. To be fair, Mr. Speaker, to workers of the essential services, those who are in the Essential Services Decree, who only have 21 days to register their grievances and also be able to access justice. To be able to be fair with them, this Bill attempts to refine the time period which you can have access to the tribunal and</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2256 Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 increase it to the same period that every other worker of this country has, which is six months. This amendment seeks to do exactly that. Mr. Speaker, the honourable Members on the other side, every ones in a while they would have played around with this book, the Constitution of 2013. Well, Section 20 of the Constitution also has a provision where employers rights are preserved. That, Mr. Speaker, I think they must also think about when they are making Opposition today. This book preserves the rights, the law that they are now opposing is what we are trying to promote that actuates the rights, that gives the nuts and bolts to the rights that people and workers of this country require from us. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to address this Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please, resume your seat.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.:</span> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the Right of Reply to the honourable Attorney-General. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, if you will allow me just to read the ILO submission to the Standing Committee in 2015, and I quote: “ILO noted in its submission to the Fiji Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights in its Report on their Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2015, the office further observes that the ILO supervisory bodies have considered that restrictions or prohibition on the right to strike maybe permitted with respect to public servants exercising authority in the name of the State. This would include civil servants in Government Ministries but would not be understood to cover a broad range of civil servants such as teachers or those working in public enterprises. The definition of “essential service” or “industry” in Part 19 includes the government and statutory authority which may go beyond the above restricted notion of exercising authority in the name of the State.” The point is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was made in 2015. We came on board, they did not do anything for eight years. Why now? Because we have to set up the mechanism first through consultation and come to Parliament. Today is a very significant day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have given the workers of this country the power they lost. Today, we have given back the power, giving them six months instead of 21 days. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, if I may.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- May I highlight a very important thing, this is actually what happens in a workplace. You are sacked, you are not given your termination letter, when you ask for it, you are not given. So, come 21 days, expire and the workers have to actually write. They have to face a lot of difficulties in trying to access these documents from their employers but then the time to appeal has gone out.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 2257</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
