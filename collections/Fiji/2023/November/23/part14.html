SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a positive note, Fijians will remain focused, committed and dedicated, thrive and achieve their set goals. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Some of these workers have assisted their families, Mr. Speaker, Sir, back home through construction of their home, farming, land cultivation, income-generating incentives, better education for their children and siblings, as well as community development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share a few success stories of our Fijian workers.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>2210</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Vinaka! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a young man from Matawalu in Lautoka has bought a truck for his father…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Thanks to FijiFirst:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.:</span> … to help him cart his sugarcane from the farm to the mill.

NALUMISA.- Tell them:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, an Aged Care Worker from Tau Village in Nadroga, went there and she took the initiative to upgrade her qualifications, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- She was assisted by the employer and after upgrading her qualifications and working for three years, in the fourth year, her employer applied for the variation of her VISA, and now, she is going for Permanent Residency and her children and spouse are going to join her. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- This lady also took the initiative to build a house, worth $45,000 in her village. MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT.- Vinaka!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D.

SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, a woman from Navua, who has just been six months of her engagement in the scheme, bought a four-wheel drive and secured a five-acre piece of land for her spouse to start their family farm. Another gentleman, Sir, from Bua secured a $50,000 home in Caubati, and he still has two years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scheme is a game changer for some of our goal-oriented workers and they have achieved more compared to what they would have done...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- You tell them:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.-... in years back home here. Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.:</span> Na cava?</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2211 (Laughter) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scheme, however, also has negative impacts on our workers and they faced several challenges during their employment in Australia. Negative impact or social issues due to family separation. Challenges which include cultural adjustment, language barrier, differences in workplace, practices. Furthermore, some workers encounter issues related to unfair treatment, overcrowded living conditions and lack of support services and breach of work rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to address these challenges and ensure that Fijian workers are provided with the necessary support, guidance and resources to thrive in their roles and contribute positively to the Australian workforce and our own economy as well as their families back home. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the health and lives of our workers is of paramount importance to us. Some Fijian workers, under the scheme, are facing psychological injuries resulting from discrimination, exploitation or mistreatment at their workplaces which can have a negative effect on their mental wellbeing. Similarly, some workers are experiencing overcrowding living conditions, inadequate pay due to unauthorised deductions, long working hours with no overtime payment which contribute to stress and psychological effect. It is important for both the sending and receiving countries to recognise these potential risks and implement measures to support the mental wellbeing of labour mobility workers. This can include providing cultural orientation, language training, social support networks and above all ensuring fair treatment and protection of workers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the challenges that our workers encounter require a comprehensive approach to address the issue. The issues need to be addressed urgently with our Australian counterparts to ensure the principle of fairness, equality, respect and dignity is upheld. We will be submitting a comprehensive report on our findings to my counterpart in Australia to be addressed by his department. We have advised him of this and very soon the report will reach his table. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to earlier, there are some excellent approved employers and there are those that are not that compliant. Non-compliance by approved employers contributes to exploitation of workers through breaches of employment laws including employment contract breaches. To address these challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is reviewing recruitment and also the performance of some labour hired employment agencies as approved employers which is not working well for the Fijian workers. We are also encouraging and promoting the host employers to recruit directly under the programme and minimise third party involvement in the process. This is to minimise malpractices in recruitment and reduce exploitation as well as occasional disengagement of our workers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the team has noted that certain visa arrangements are very restrictive, there are conditions which say, “No pregnancy, no family visitation and no worker portability”. Sir, worker portability means joining another employer to work with which is a violation of worker’s rights and both human rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had this discussion with our Australian counterpart and now it has been agreed that workers can be moved from one workplace to another in the same industry. Our workers also have been advised to ensure that with the assistance of the Country Liaison Officers put in writing all their grievances to the employers so that it can be escalated to higher authorities in the proper manner.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>2212</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the role of the Country Liaison Officer is the key to the Fijian Government as it serves as a vital link between the Fijian workers, Australian approved employers and the Fijian Government ensuring effective communication, coordination and support for the success of the scheme for both Governments. The Country Liaison Officers will be responsible for ensuring the seamless transition of the Fijian workers providing an ongoing support and addressing concerns while promoting Fiji abroad. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week the Ministry has finalised the appointment of the second Liaison Officer to be based in Brisbane to look after the workers in Queensland and Northern Territory. The appointee will start work in two weeks’ time. In the coming weeks the Ministry will advertise the position of the third Country Liaison Officer in Sydney to look after workers in New South Wales.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Minister check from the ground:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.:</span> There are no Liaison Officers, you never appointed one. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said this earlier, the Australian Government had approved the allocation of funds for a Liaison Officer in 2021. They never appointed. We have appointed the first one now and we have appointed the second one and now we are appointing the third one. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- In the new year, we will appoint the fourth one and that is when we will be relieved to having to go and visit them every time. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- They were sleeping on the job:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hogwash! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Minister of Finance for approving the two Liaison Officer allocations and with that we are appointing and the third one. For the fourth one we have now asked the Australian Government to assist with and hopefully in the new year, we will appoint that one to be based in Western Australia. Once we have four Liaison Officers, we will be breathing a sigh of relief. The Liaison Officers will be the direct link between the workers, employer and us, and they will provide us with monthly progress reports, and of course to the High Commission. In that manner, they will resolve the problems on the spot. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the ongoing commitment to the PALM Scheme, the transition of the Scheme from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relationships, is a strategic move and we are very happy that the whole Scheme is now under the Ministry of Employment, to say in simple terms. The Ministry of Employment and Workplace Relationship is now having the Scheme under its wings, and that makes things easier for us because we will deal directly with the Minister and his team. This way we will be more focused and there will be fewer layers of unnecessary …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Travel:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.:</span> … structures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in strengthening both the Fiji and Australia collaborative efforts, they have agreed to work on data sharing initiatives, and this will</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2213 involve sharing of relevant information and resources to improve the effectiveness of the Scheme to ensure the successful implementation of all the goals. Data sharing initiatives will help us to develop a new national labour mobility framework strategy to facilitate cooperation and coordination between the sending country and the receiving country, as well as between the government agencies. All in all, the Fijian Government is looking forward to finalising the Australia-Fiji bilateral Labour Agreement under the PALM or the MOU following the merging of both the short term and the long-term programmes in April, 2022. We hope to finalise the MOU once the draft implementation arrangements are made available by our Australian counterparts. Mr. Speaker, Sir the revised MOU will improve governance of the Labour Migration Scheme in several ways. It highlights the principle of cooperation and responsibility sharing between the sending country and the host country by improving inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination. This is because development negotiations, implementation and monitoring of Bilateral Labour Agreements require coordination amongst different ministries as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bilateral Labour Agreement will continue to create transparency, a major component of good governance and to be developed based on social dialogue and inclusive consultative processes for both countries. The Bilateral Labour Agreement will lead to positive changes in laws, policies and practices for better governance of the whole scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am confident that the PALM Scheme will continue to be a valuable opportunity for the Fijians workers, and I am committed to addressing the challenges they face while working in Australia. The Vuvale Partnership Agreement provides a golden opportunity to Fiji to collaborate with the Australian Government and improve our labour mobility scheme for the benefit of all parties involved including support towards our economy which to-date stands at approximately $50 million in remittance annually. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji therefore has the opportunity to diversify our economy by strengthening and growing our Labour Mobility Programme towards economic resilience and at the same time has the obligation for the duty of care for our Fijians working abroad under these schemes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday the honourable Minister said that during my term I never visited the workers.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Today he comes to this Parliament and say that is what I did:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D.

M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Answer the question:</span></p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>2214</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 HON. P. K. BALA.- And I will tell him, now I am going to tell him and you will listen to what I am going to say. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I wish to thank the honourable Minister of Employment for his</p><h4>Ministerial Statement justifying his travels that he made but let me tell him …</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He help cleaned up your mess:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> … that no amount of justification will reverse the decisions that he took to travel and I have always call his travels as “wine and dine travels”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Employment Centre was established under the National Employment Centre Act 2009 under the Bainimarama Government. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. P. K. BALA.- That is the fact! HON. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Did you visit or not?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> No one can take away that fact, even you honourable Kamikamica.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Future Prime Minister:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vuvale Partnership was signed in 2019 between the two former Prime Ministers of Australia and Fiji and Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what they had to say at that time and I quote, “we commit to this not only as friends and partners but as families as vuvale ”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the initial stage this task was very difficult. There was a huge competition by our neighbouring countries. The staff at the Ministry of Employment had to work day and night to build upon our name and brand and that is how this programme has become so successful.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Hear! Hear.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, May last year, Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Senator Wong, came to Fiji, and after our discussions, she announced that the Australian Government is working towards allowing the families of workers to live in Australia, and it is not a new subject. Mr. Speaker, Sir, later last year, the Australian Prime Minister met with us and talks were held to increase the Caregivers from Fiji under the PALM Scheme. Here in Fiji, not there in Australia. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all worked hard, as I have said earlier on, even during trying times, like COVID-19, to make sure that Fiji does not fail in its obligation in terms of the agreement. During our term, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had sent around 7,000 Fijians to Australia and New Zealand for employment. I do not know what the figure is now, honourable Minister. You should have said in this Chamber the number of people you have sent.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2215 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, the FijiFirst Government, have laid a very solid foundation for this growth. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- And we hope that the honourable Minister will build on that:</span></p><p>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were criticised for these programmes by some of the honourable Members on the other side, so let us not forget that. The slogan was that the villages will be empty under these programmes, but that was not the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Today this programme has become so important for this Government, that the honourable Minister has to make regular visits to Australia and New Zealand. (Laughter) What he has talked about, the success stories, I used to come here and inform Parliament on the success stories, that is the whole objective of that programme. The programme is designed in such a way that they would come, assist the villagers and the families, that is an ongoing thing. It is nothing new. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I briefly said on the works that we did, was all done here in Fiji, without making regular trips, like my colleague, the honourable Minister. But during our term, Sir, we had trust, this is the word, “trust”, on our staff at the Embassy to carry out this work, and also the team leaders that we sent from here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the word “trust” is important. What I can gather now is that this honourable Minister has got no trust in the staff of the Embassy. (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. K. BALA.- I think he does not even trust his Prime Minister because the honourable Prime Minister went to meet the seasonal workers. Then after one week, I read in the papers that he also went. (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- What is all happening? And then you come here and my God – big song, sing, dance and everything. (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, there is even Liaison Officers. So, I hope from now onwards, since we have Liaison Officers, Embassy staff, team leaders (there are a lot of team leaders), that these wine and dine trips will stop. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Development and Way Forward for Sea Cucumber Fishery in Fiji HON. K. V. RAVU.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests in the gallery and members of the public who are watching the livestream from the comfort of their homes; a very good morning to you all. I rise to deliver a Statement on the Sea Cucumber Fishery in Fiji and it is my hope that the information shared though this Statement will provide a holistic insight to us all.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>2216</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the trading of sea cucumber in the Pacific started in the early 1800s and is currently a multi-million dollar industry in the region, second only to tuna with some 21 sea cucumber species making up 90 percent of the trade. Sea cucumbers are an important source of income for local fishers, including women, and their export is considered as one of the oldest trades in Fiji. As you are aware, Fiji has traded sea cucumbers since 1813 and because of its lucrative status, it has continued trade until today with imposition of fishing and trading bans by the Government of the day along the way. Sea cucumbers which are largely traded in a smoked dry-form referred to as beche-de-mer or trepang, are high in protein and important amino acids, and consumed mainly by Chinese and other Southeast Asians for health and medicinal benefits. MR. SPEAKER.- What is the biological name - sea cucumber, beche-de-mer and what?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, I have forgotten the name.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> What?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- holothuria scabra:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I could not get what you said, but you just continue.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- It is holothuria scabra:</span></p><p>Over 13 million people are involved in sea cucumber collection across 83 countries with over 90 percent of the world tropical coastlines participating in the trade. The main consuming countries are mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the high market demand, coupled with the associated risks on use of sustainable fishing practices and inadequate management strategies had led to the decline in sea cucumber stocks and health hazards for harvesters. In recognising this, the Ministry imposed the fishing ban in 2017 to protect this fishery and allow natural repopulation. The band was of two parts: 1. Ban on the use of underwater breathing apparatus; and 2. ban on harvest or sale. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this ban was lifted in July 2022, with closure for harvesting in February 2023 and exports in April of the same year. The intent of lifting of the ban was to support national economic recovery after the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic and more so, individuals and communities for basic survival needs as most were made redundant from their jobs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lifting of the ban to allow the harvest and export for this period had served its purpose with some $18 million to $20 million direct benefits paid out to harvesting communities and individuals. It was overwhelming to see the various forms of investments our fisher folk had engaged during this opening. This included infrastructure, improvements at village level, housing, procurement of machines and equipment to support income generating activities, investments and many more.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2217 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was equally important that the Ministry tracked exports of bech-de-mer. Our records show that a total volume of 140,000 metric tonnes of bech-de-mer were exported during the opening in 2022-2023. The value is estimated to be $11 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the sustainability in the stock, the following were in place in the 2022-2023 opening of the ban: 1. A defined criteria was in place for the selection of traders. A total of 11 companies were engaged by the BDM Licensing Committee and it was chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Industry and Trade and co-opted an additional three Permanent Secretaries as members. All these traders were issued with conditions to operate. 2. The 11 companies engaged agents to buy sea cucumber from harvesters. 3. A special licence specifically for sea cucumber harvest was issued to fisher folks through the normal licensing process under section 13 of the Fisheries Act (Cap 158). 4. A monitoring plan was also in placed by our Enforcement Team to ensure compliance to the licensing and trading conditions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry undertook a bech-de-mer stock assessments in the Western Division with the SPC experts and surveyed some of the i qoliqoli with the most harvest pressure. The areas show presence of species which indicates that they have not been fully wiped out as speculated and will be repopulating. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on these assessments, the Coalition Government reopened the ban for six months in July 2023 and for closure on 31 st December, 2023. The intent of the opening was for three reasons - for national economic recovery, greater community empowerment and to open up spaces for iTaukei-owned businesses to trade in this lucrative commodity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the processes that were in the first lifting of the ban, the new ones implemented by the Coalition Government through the Ministry are as follows: 1. The defined criteria was expanded to allow eligible iTaukei own companies to be part of this process. 3. 2. An internal committee chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Fisheries and Forestry evaluated the submissions. This streamlined process allowed for swift decisions to be made. Twenty-one companies were engaged to buy and sell sea cucumber, of which 25 percent was iTaukei owned and they had secured their direct markets to Hong Kong. In the first opening in July 2022, there was a zero percent involvement of iTaukei-owned companies. It was mandatory for companies to liaise directly with communities and harvesters, resulting in better pricing offers for harvesters. 4. 5. As part of their corporate social responsibility, traders were tasked to engage in hatchery and culturing activities with selected communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for both lifting periods, the lucrative profits, gains and benefits has shown positive impacts in improving the livelihoods of communities and fisher folks and have contributed to economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the current opening period, the estimated volume of exports recorded by the Ministry is 42,000 metric tonnes with a value of FJ$4 million. More shipments are expected to</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>2218</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 be received in next month of opening. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Ministry’s attempt to ensure sustainability in this fishery, the following is currently being implemented: 1. Together with its partners, the Ministry has undertaken various assessments to study the viability of the beche-de-mer fishery and understand the stock status. This includes the National Science Expedition which has just concluded in the last two months. This was a rapid assessment that was led by the Ministry in collaboration with Blue Prosperity Fiji and the WAITT Foundation. The preliminary report has shown that there are beche-de-mer stocks on our reefs, while some areas have fared better than others. There are measures and monitoring in place to ensure that communities continue to adhere to specified size limits and conditions imposed. Following these studies, the Ministry plans for a more extensive national stock assessment. This is a very costly exercise, we will, therefore, seek funding to undertake this through the normal budgetary process and through our partners. 2. The Ministry has already started scoping for communities with potential for sea cucumbers sea ranching projects. The Ministry is also liaising with donors partners, through furthering the scope of hatchery at Makogai to increase large scale production and rearing of sea cucumbers and replenishing coastal reefs around Fiji. 3. Galoa Hatchery has juvenile sandfish ready for restocking some of the reefs where the broodstock was spawned from. In addition, some of the sites have already been reseeded with juvenile sandfish. 4. The Ministry will finalise its Sea Cucumber Management Plan and regulations to ensure controlled harvesting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to inform this august Parliament and the general public at large on work that the Ministry is undertaking to balance conservation and production of these fishery. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, honourable Minister, how many direct importers and exporters local do we have? You have mentioned a few but I could not get the actual figures of locals in that category. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total number of exporters is 21 and we have 11 iTaukei exporters. MR. SPEAKER.- Would it be simpler to Australia if you have to be an importer or a local resident in China to be an importer?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> No, Sir, it is a direct export to their clients in Hong Kong and China.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I said that I am interested because of my co:</span> ownership of the qoliqoli and we have been dealing with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, honourable Minister. So I suggest just to polish up on those figures that I have been asking because it is hard to penetrate to be an exporter or importer. You are an exporter if you are Fijian but you have to be a resident somewhere in China or Hong Kong to be an importer. Is that correct?</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2219</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Alright, that is enough. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak in response to the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forest Ministerial Statement on Sea Cucumber Fishery in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be addressing sea cucumber as beche-de-mer which is much easier for me to refer to or BDM. The ban on sea cucumber was introduced in 1987 as an affirmative action initiative. It was to help iTaukei communities along the coast and around the islands in Fiji. It was to prompt them to enter into commercial activities and this had initiated the immediate response by local communities especially on maritime islands and coastal areas in Vanua Levu and Viti Levu. During the 30 years of harvest there was no guideline to the harvesters of BDM especially the merchants and the middlemen. The benefit basically over those 30 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the middlemen and merchants. Our local population did not get the total benefit that was initiated to benefit our local population. Let me just give you an example, BDM would be bought at about FJ$70 here in Fiji and it was sold in Hong Kong open market at US$200. The merchants basically went out and distributed boats and engines as part payment for our local population to collect and sell the resource back to the merchants. It was really totally unfair. The practice basically drove the BDM population to almost extinct. In fact, two species have gone through the process of extinction in Fiji and luckily during those years when the ban was introduced, it had repopulated our reef. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue with beche-de-mer when it had gone out of the shallow waters that used to be harvested by our ancestors and it can only be found in deep waters, our population around the coast started using diving gears and this was a great concern. There was a huge number of fatalities amongst our iTaukei population in Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Yasawa basically were the scapegoats of these buying and selling. Fiji was on the verge of losing two main species, golden fish and black fish. The Ministry of Fisheries was able to repopulate our ocean during that period. The initial ban was for five years. We had planned that within the five years, the population would come back. Fortunately, within three years, we had report on our stock assessment that the population has rejuvenated. The whole of the Lau Group was reported to have the population that had never been seen before; the beaches were full of beche-de-mer. In that context that we were waiting for the five years, the cyclones hit Fiji. We started to put a programme to re-introduce for our local communities along the coast and the maritime islands to harvest this to benefit them. It prompted us to make a quick restock and stock assessment. That was bulldozed by the cyclones and then COVID-19. In fact, we were lucky that we had reached the five years when COVID-19 hit. So, the population of beche-de- mer around the coastal areas was in huge quantity. Basically, the honourable Minister has explained what had resulted out of the harvest and the sale. I thank the honourable Minister for highlighting the strict guideline that was given. I also thank the initiative to involve the local communities, especially iTaukei to be involved in the export. This is an area, I had travelled to Hong Kong, and I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would know how difficult it is to enter the Hong Kong market of beche-de-mer, but I was able to go across, through our representative in Hong Kong and force him to allow our iTaukei to be also exporters of the commodity. I hope in the context of all these, the Government will still look at sustainability as a</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>2220</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 major consideration for our future generations. We must not allow the leisure of our generations to be denied from our future generations. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this is a very interesting topic and I think if only the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications could look into and see how best we can explore it. In several of our visits to Hong Kong, in transit we were met by the Chamber of Commerce, as highlighted by honourable Koroilavesau. I was interested to touch on how best we can penetrate that big market in China. This is a very expensive food in China. They take all the sea cucumbers, they can grab hold from all the seas all over the world, and they are very good businesspeople. They will milk you dry before you realise you have run out of stock. I was listening very closely to the statement by the honourable Minister, since he is a fisheries expert, maybe this is something that could be followed up, because I am wearing another hat here and it interests me. We levy $10,000 for some local men to come and dive for this; $10,000 is peanuts. They will do this all over the seas in Fiji, and there is only one big exporter sitting out there in Labasa. He gets all the juice out of all these without dipping his head in the water. We have tried using machines and we have suffered a lot, then they banned the usage of this and honourable Koroilavesau knows that fully well because we were at the extreme mercy of the weather and we did not know how to observe all these things and we suffered these bans and we had to be rushed Suva by medivac to be able to put in those decompression chambers. It is quite costly for us but it is lucrative business, and we have them in abundance. If only we could be helped just to see how best we can also enter the market and play in the market. That would certainly be promising for the big qoliqoli owners all over Fiji. Honourable Members, we will adjourn for lunch now since I have another meeting, and hopefully when we return, we will continue when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.16 p.m.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2221 The Parliament resumed at 2.27 p.m.</p></body>
