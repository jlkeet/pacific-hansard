<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – BA TOWN COUNCIL 2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – BA TOWN COUNCIL 2019 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of Ba Town Council Annual Report for the 2019 which was tabled on 13 th September, 2023.</p><div><a name="100">Page 100</a></div><p>2286 Consolidated Review Report - Ba Town Council 2019 Annual Report 23 rd Nov., 2023</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, in 1905 the Ba Rural Local Authority was established under the Public Health Ordinance to administer the District of Ba on various matters. The urbanised area of Varoka was proclaimed a township under the Township Ordinance in 1939. The Local Government Act was enacted in 1972, Ba was then alleviated to town status in June 1972. Mr. Speaker, the Committee acknowledged the commitment of Ba Town Council in the upkeep of urban sanitary and the continuity of rezoning in the district. This contributed positively in the District of Ba for the year 2019. Mr. Speaker, the Committee also commends the work carried out by the Council and would like to recommend that it continues to promote community engagement in order to achieve a healthy and a clean environment. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I have a list of speakers in front of me: 1. Honourable P. K. Bala; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; and 3. Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament and Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be my shortest contribution. As you all know, Ba is basically a soccer crazy town, and last month we won the IDC 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got two issues, one is the flooding, in Ba and I urge my good friend, Minister for Waterways, can you look up, please? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- He is your friend? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do for 16 years? HON. P. K. BALA.- PM, change him!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We did many other things:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Minister for Waterways to look into it. In past years, Ba River was dredged and the people of Ba were safe from the floods. So, that is what we did, honourable Kamikamica. The other one that I want to inform Parliament, that, a few weeks ago, there was a statement made that the grounds at Govind Park and the boundary fence was included (because that is in the Report) in the original contract, but I want to clarify that, that was in Phase 2 and it was not included in the original contract. So, with that clarification, I support the motion that is before us. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before this august Parliament this evening. First, I would like to thank honourable Bala for supporting the motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I share some insights into the recommendations put forward by the Committee, first I would like to thank the Special Administrator, CEO and the staff of Ba Town Council for diligently serving the people of Ba Town.</p><div><a name="101">Page 101</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report – Ba Town Council 2019 Annual Report 2287 Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were four recommendations put forward by the Committee and these are very vital and also important for the development of Ba Town. One which is common in all Councils is the untimely preparation of annual accounts and some from the Ministry have been working with other municipal councils to address issues, and we also attach this with KPIs so that they will be able to produce annual accounts on time. That is something that the Ministry is working on right now with all municipal councils in Fiji including, Ba Town. Next one is the issue of flooding in Ba. I know in one of my recent visit to Ba, I think I have done two visits already, something that has been raised, not only by the Council’s CEO, as well as employees, and even by the residents of Ba. Something that we are working on right now is to work on the Elevuka Creek which, according to the people of Ba, is something that contributes significantly to the flooding of Ba Town, as well as the dredging of the Ba River. It is something that we are working closely with the Ministry of Waterways, to ensure that this is done and also to assist the people of Ba Town. Another very important issue raised by the Committee is on the completion of Govind Park. It is something that needs to be completed right now because the people of Ba, even though they won the IDC, they are not enjoying watching their own team play on their home ground. That is something they are trying to do this year, so hopefully with the appointment of a lead consultants working on Phase 2 of the project, we should be able to complete and to ensure that the people of Ba enjoy watching their own players playing in Govind Park. There are some issues too with Govind Park, something, that we are also looking into right now. Hopefully, the Ministry will address to ensure that if you have a project, you must make the project is done in a timely manner, as well as done to standard. Two very important issues on the satellite towns. The two satellite towns were not really because one is on a road reserve and the other is on open space. What the Council is doing now is to liaise with the relevant agencies to formalise the rezoning of the two lots where the satellite towns, according to Committee has to complete or put up a satellite town in Ba. The Ministry have given its assurance that it is going to assist Ba Town Council in completing some of the projects and one is Govind Park. Honourable Bala will also be happy, hopefully the people of Ba will be able to watch their players playing at the Govind Park in Ba. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I fully support the motion before Parliament. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the Report on the Ba Town Council. Their key findings include as mentioned on the flooding and that has been mentioned by few honourable Members and the need for us to look into mitigation measures not only for the Ministry of Waterways but of course, Ministry of Public Works too moving forward, we do recognise that not only for Ba but also for Nadi. There were issues raised regarding the delays in obtaining development approvals. Noted the satellite markets in Varadoli and Namosau Wards which intends to ease traffic which is an ongoing issue not only for the Council but also with FRA. We note the improvement in rate arrears collection of $1.94 million to $3.074 million in 2019 and we do acknowledge the Council’s enhanced payment plans. These key findings present the Coalition Government with the need to build up on the recommendations moving forward as mentioned by the honourable Minister and, of course, I was very surprised that honourable Bala has taken the issue about Govind Park very lightly when there have been issues with the construction of the first phase, especially noting some of the defects which the Coalition Government has now taken on board to address and moving forward.</p><div><a name="102">Page 102</a></div><p>2288 Consolidated Review Report – FPF 2017-2020 Annual Reports 23 rd Nov., 2023 I note that he commissioned that in 2018 and after that there was a long delay before the commencement of phase two. That sort deprived the young people of Ba in terms of their sports facilities. So, when the young people were deprived, I was wondering where honourable Ketan Lal was? He did not say anything regarding that. (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Neither honourable Ritesh Sharma, even though the Ba Rugby Union is now being promoted to Skipper Cup we are still depriving them. HON. P. K. BALA.- Go, go, go! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- So under the Coalition Government we will ensure that that ground comes into operation very soon. I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for fast-forwarding that and also personally visiting them. It is very surprising that a Member of Parliament from Labasa comes to solve the problem in Ba …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> … while the honourable Member of Parliament from Ba is sitting there. (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- We will be working on that and I would like to thank the Council. I would also like to thank honourable Bala too for his contribution in terms of the development of that and moving forward. I support the motion, Sir. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would again like to thank all honourable Members that commented and contributed to the motion before Parliament, and your comments are highly noted by the Committee. I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed.</p></body>
