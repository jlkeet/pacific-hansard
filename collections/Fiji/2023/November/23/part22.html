<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - TAVUA TOWN COUNCIL 2015 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - TAVUA TOWN COUNCIL 2015 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the review of Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report for the year ending 2015 which was tabled on the 12 th of September 2022.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Tavua was formally incorporated as a Town in 1992. Tavua Town covers a land area of 102 square kilometres. Apart from the agricultural sector contributing to the economy of Tavua Town, the Gold Mine and the mineral water factories continue to develop to sustainably provide for the Town and its people through employment. In 2015, Tavua Town Council assisted stakeholders in achieving its ultimate objectives by recognising its contribution to socio-economic development, which uplifts the standard of Tavua Town. For instance, the Council assisted the Ministry of Agriculture in organising the Agriculture Show in Tavua. This was the first of its kind and it was an advantage for the people of Tavua to witness activities and programmes piloted by the Ministry of Agriculture; and the establishment of the Ex-Offenders Association and the engagement of offenders in the Council. Tavua Town was awarded the Clean Small Town Designation in 2015 and this can be seen as a boost and recognition to Tavua as a Town; Interagency meeting on Child Abuse, Neglect and Abandonment with Government officials; and Tavua Town Council also organised its first ever New Year Street Party in 2015. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends the work carried out by the Council and would like to recommend that it continues to promote community engagement to achieve a healthy environment and efficient infrastructure. The Committee compiled through its deliberation on the review of Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report and found that a loss of $5,142 was incurred in 2015, and from 2010 to 2015, it resulted in the accumulative loss of $1.1 million; funding constraints faced by the Council to carry out programmes and initiatives to improve infrastructure in Tavua and there was a shortage of technical expertise in the Council. It also noted that Tavua Town Council has asked the well-established municipal councils that were well resourced, that they should share their qualified personnel to assist in their operations which in turn will enhance the service delivery of the Council. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have the list of speakers: 1. Honourable Viam Pillay; 2. Honourable Minister Nalumisa; 3. Honourable Premila Kumar; and 4. Honourable Assistant Minister- Esrom Immanuel. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before Parliament today to give a few remarks on the review conducted by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report. This Report serves not only as an account of the Council’s activities, but as a valuable guide posed for the future development and progress of Tavua Town Council. The key findings outlined in the Report should be viewed not merely as challenges, but as opportunities for</p><div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report 2283 strategic intervention and improvement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee’s recommendations are constructive and forward looking, emphasising the timely submission of annual reports, collaboration with various stakeholders for economic development, prioritising the development of the dumping site and encouraging the sharing of qualified personnel amongst municipals, are steps in the right direction. The call for collaboration with well-established municipal councils highlights the spirit of solidarity and mentorship that should underpin the relationship between municipalities fostering a collective effort for the greater good. With those few words, Mr, Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. Thank you. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before this august Parliament to address pressing matters raised by Standing Committee on Social Affairs concerning the Review of Tavua Town Council Annual Report 2015. First, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairperson and honourable Members for reviewing these reports. I also would like to thank the Special Administrators, the CEO and the staff of the Tavua Town Council for meticulously serving the people of Tavua. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation by the Committee are very critical and for me justifies the need to have a Local Government Election, once Local Government Election be able to get in, responsible Councillors would be able to assist the Council as well as the Ministry in addressing some of the very pertinent issues that are being raised here such things like submission of Annual Reports as well as the need to have more collaboration with NGOs, Civil Society because the size of Tavua Town, it does not have the financial means to sustain itself. It is particularly important that we involve some of the stakeholders and even some of the societies and donor partners to assist the Council in carrying some of its very important services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a good example raised by the Committee is the need for the Council to look for a dump site. The Council has already identified one, but issue here is that they do not have the financial means to develop the dump site. That is why there is a need to get in good people, to be the Council, be able to get in good ideas, new ideas as well as the business acumen as well as build relationships with other donor partners as well as other organizations in assisting the people of Tavua. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think these are very important issues to the Ministry and is working with the CEOs as well as the staff of Tavua Town Council to ensure especially a financial accounts, just to add on the importance of getting Annual Accounts rate but this year, the Office of the Auditor-General has diligently audited 2017-2019 Financial Statements. The Council has submitted 2020 Financial Statements for auditing with ongoing efforts to finalise the 2021-2022 Financial Statements. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua is a very small town with only 287 ratepayers while the Tavua District population stands at 23,000. Often on the back of a small number of ratepayers the Town Council is expected to provide services to all citizens residing in the Tavua District. So, it becomes difficult for any Council to support a large number of people living in the District when they are able to only collect limited amount of resources from their ratepayers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak on each recommendation made by the Committee, I agree with Recommendation No. 1 which talks about submission of Annual Reports in a timely manner. For Tavua there was no qualified Finance Officer to address these issues across the Councils, CEOs were appointed who had knowledge skills and qualifications in finance.</p><div><a name="98">Page 98</a></div><p>2284 Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report 23 rd Nov., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the currency of Tavua Town Council, Mr. Sailosi Sawana, who was previously employed at the Ministry of Economy, is a qualified public Accountant with over 25 years of Accounting, Corporate and audit experience. Now Tavua and Rakiraki Town Councils have a very capable CEO to lead and deliver timely Annual Reports, so this matter should be resolved. The Committee also recommended that the Council works with the Government, Non-Government Organisations, donor agencies and landowners to develop Tavua Town as it has economic potential. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua Town is extremely difficult where the market is, market and bus stand. There is no State land where one can go in and quicky develop that area and build a market or bus stand. For a very long time, we were negotiating with the landowners but amongst the mataqali, there was a land dispute and the matter is before the court. The only option Tavua Town Council have is to completely move the market and bus stand far away from where it is if they are in search of State land but then it is not practical. There are so many shops around it so that is a catch-22 situation which Tavua Town Council is currently facing and hopefully when the dispute is settled in court then the government can start negotiating with the rightful owner of that land and move forward from there onwards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to mention, and I think the Minister also mentioned, that Tavua is the home for Vatukoula Gold Mine and Fiji’s largest water bottling plant, Fiji Water. As part of the social responsibility, the least Fiji Water can do to assist the Council is to develop … HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- … the town for the ratepayers and visitors because they use Tavua Town. They do not pay any rates, but they use the facilities of Tavua Town and now that Fiji Water will not be paying 25 percent corporate tax for the next seven years, they do have surplus money and they should be able to invest it into a town where they are based. Simple as that. So Tavua has been approaching Fiji Water for a while, through their Special Administrators and CEO, but they have not come back with a concrete suggestion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Because you did not treat them with respect, that is why.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> It is not about the respect, they need a favour from you so you have given them a favour through the national budget.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You need to treat them with respect to get respect:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> So favours were made and, therefor,e they need to invest in Tavua Town. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation 4, the Council had identified freehold land in the interior which is a mountainous area to be the dump site. So, when they started negotiating with the landowner, yes, the cost was very high, the valuation was high and Ministry of Finance could not provide that funding because the valuation was low but the landowners was asking for more money. HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tavua Town Council, through the Ministry of Local Government, has received are total of $1.3 million since 2015 which is a favourable support from the Government. I just wish to talk on a few recommendations which I support. We visited Tavua Town and we support that Tavua Town has economic potential, thus the Council will collaborate with Government, Non-Government Organisations, donor organisations and landowners to develop the town.</p><div><a name="99">Page 99</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report-Ba Town Council 2019 Annual Report 2285 Recommendation 3 where the Town Council needs to continue with its work in prioritizing development of its dumping site. Recommendation 4 - a well-established municipal council that is well resourced should share their qualified personnel to assist municipalities in their operations which will enhance service delivery. We saw that there is probably a drawback for both Tavua and Rakiraki for being small and they do not have a well organised or well co-ordinated effort to manage those two Councils. Mr. Speaker, Sir, lastly, I wish to talk on the financial account or the financial record of the Council, something that we rarely talk on. While we are looking at the 2015 Annual Account, the Public Accounts Committee is also looking at the 2016 account. We have noted that the auditors mentioned that all or most of the Council’s accounts have been extensively delayed due to non- submission of financial accounts on time. In a sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have not met the Local Government Act 1972 section 57 (1) and (3) for several years and for Tavua Town Council it is more than six years. Are we accepting this? Probably for the past government but not the current one. For Tavua, the 2017 and 2020 accounts were provided and under audit in March 2023. The 2021 and 2022 are yet to be provided. So, the Council is quite late. Internal controls were bad or ineffective. Apart from the timing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the opinions given for 2015 were modified or qualified when misstatements eventually or in aggregate material but not pervasive to the financial statements or in simple terms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is material misstatements or non-compliance and or lack of sufficient appropriate audit evidence to the financial statements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has been going on for ages, not only for Tavua but for the other Town Councils as well. There a lot anomalies but Tavua is a bit better than Levuka. Generally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were issues prevalent in most or all Councils and I hope the Minister do take note and encourages his PS and Directors to resolve all of them before the proposed election. One unreconciled of substantiated balances, poor record keeping with extensive manual records, different system used by different Councils, quality staff shortages and lack of quality supervision from the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the honourable Members who have contributed to the motion before Parliament and I concur that the Council have a lot of pending reports to submit. The Committee has encouraged the Tavua Town Council and the rest of the Councils that we will be debating this evening and remind them of the need to submit their Annual Reports on time. Thank, Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
