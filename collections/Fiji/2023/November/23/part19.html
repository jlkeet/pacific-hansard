<body><h3>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><p>MAHOGANY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 21 st November, 2023 I move: That the Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 28/2023) be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled on Tuesday, 21 st November, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mahogany Industry Act 2010, as mentioned when the Bill was first tabled, establishes the Mahogany Industry Council with the Prime Minister as Chairperson. Apart from this under the current legislative regime, the Prime Minister is also the Minister responsible for the administration of the Act. Under the Act, the principal function of the Council is to supervise and direct the maintenance and development of the Mahogany Industry in Fiji and in particular to supervise and direct Fiji</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2258 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 Hardwood Corporation Limited and Fiji Mahogany Trust in the performance of their functions under the Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to transfer the overall responsibility of the Act and by extension the regulation of the Mahogany Industry from the Office of the Prime Minister to the Office of the Ministry of Forestry. The Amendments proposed in the Bill will allow the Ministry of Forestry to provide the much-needed technical expertise, advice and guidance to the Council, to achieve its mandated objectives, such as: 1. 2. 3. The need for the Mahogany Industry to be operated on the basis that is sustainable in the long-term and in particular the need for a comprehensive programme. The desirability of the value being added within Fiji to mahogany timber and mahogany timber products. The aim of achieving a fair return to landowners for the mahogany timber on their land. It also looks after the interest of the people of Fiji as a whole including opportunities for increase employment and skills training. It also maintains high quality mahogany timber and timber produced in Fiji. To establish a scheme for the certification of the fell mahogany timber. The development of a recognised brand for Fiji Mahogany Timber and Timber products. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the transferring of the custodianship of the Act and Chairmanship of the Council to the Ministry of Forestry and Minister for Forestry, respectively it is not a reform that has been done in isolation. But one that complements what is already a collaborative relationship between the Ministry of Forestry and the Mahogany Industry. For instance, in September of this year, the Ministry of Forestry and the Fiji Mahogany Trust signed a grant agreement for $250,000 to better coordinate the needs of Mahogany landowners and to further enhance the contribution towards the Mahogany industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry has been working in the forest certification space for more than 15 years and with the support from the World Life Fund provided a technical support and also the Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Forest Certification Gap Analysis and Roadmap Report. In March 2022, the Ministry of Forestry facilitated that the forest certification preparatory workshop as part of the endeavour for the forest stewardship certification to extend to Fijiâ€™s Mahogany plantations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for reference the attainment of the FSC confirms that the forest has been managed in a way that protects biological diversity and benefits the lives of local people and works while ensuring sustain economic viability. There is a need for our mahogany to be certified to enable us to compete in the international market arena. Adding its value to the place and to place us above other similar mahogany sources from Asia and Africa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the representative of collaborative existing efforts but when we speak of technical expertise and knowledge that the Ministry of Forestry can impart to the mahogany industry, the examples mentioned are practical illustrations that we are referring to. Under the Act, the Council has powers to fix the terms of a mahogany timber may be sold to FHCL to direct FHCL to enter into an agreement with specified persons for the sale of mahogany timber to determine how the proceeds of sale of mahogany timbers are to be distributed or used, and to give directive to FHCL and Fiji Mahogany Trust and to give directives to the iTaukei Land Trust Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these very important powers, it only stands to reason that the Council must have meetings to allow them to exercise their powers in a manner that is conducive to the exercise of their powers. However, since the commencement of the Act, on 3 rd May, 2010, the</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 2259 Council last had its meeting sometimes in 2018. That means, in eight years they did not have that. That is two terms of Parliament. It must be noted, that under the Act, the Council meets at such times and places as the chairperson may appoint. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also one of the issues that the Bill seeks to rectify. By allowing the Minister for Forestry to assume the chairmanship of the Council so that the Council may meet at regular intervals. It is clear to all of us the busy schedule of the honourable Prime Minister, so if the honourable Prime Minister is the chairperson of such Council, it will really hamper its performance, as was illustrated in the last eight years when it did not meet once. In the 2018-2019 Report on Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities and other entities, the Office of the Attorney-General in this audit of the FHCL noted that the mahogany harvested in 2017 and 2018, had not been replanted to maintain the sustainability of the mahogany plantation as required by the Licencing Agreement under the Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just one of the examples which highlight the need for the Ministry of Forestry to oversee the administration of the Act, given the technical insight and resources they have which would allow them to monitor compliance with obligations under the Act. Under the Forest Act 1982, the Ministry of Forestry bears the responsibility of being the administrator of matters related to Fiji forest and forest produce. In its response to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, regarding questions posed on the Ministry of Forestry on the 2017-2018 Annual Report, the Ministry of Forestry had advised that mahogany plantations on private land or individually owned land were regulated by the Ministry. Therefore, the Bill also allows for the streamlining of processes as the regulating of forest products, inclusive of mahogany timber, will be regulated by one institution, that is the Ministry of Forestry. I would like to inform Parliament that the Coalition Government is committed to reforming the mahogany industry. Therefore, the Bill is one of the reforms and the Coalition Government is committed to implementing for the ultimate benefit of our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has a significant mahogany industry which has the potential to make a substantial contribution to our economy. Therefore, to encourage such an industry, it is only right that with the approval of Parliament, assign the role of the chairperson of the Council and the overall administration of the Act to the Minister for Forestry and the Ministry of Forestry respectively. This will allow the implementation of the Act to be conducted more effectively and efficiently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate. The list before me identifies three speakers, the: 1. Honourable Leader of the Opposition; 2. Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forests; and 3. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. At the sound of the first bell, I shall be humbly asking you, honourable Members, to resume your seat so as to enable us to get the next speaker to continue. The floor is now open for debate and the floor is yours, honourable Leader of Opposition. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications,</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>2260 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 again, he has been harping about nothing being done in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir in almost all his speeches in this august Parliament but the problem is, he was not in the country most of the time in these 16 years, and he is not conversant with the developments that have taken place. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad in the last Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, keeps reminding us that the voters are watching, the voters are watching. We are not concerned about the voters, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because politics without principles is dangerous.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> No, I said workers not voters.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> I will say that again, politics without principles is dangerous.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I said, workers, not voters.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KOROILAVESAU.- Stand up:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Whether they are workers or voters, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the workers are voters as well. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> What this country needs are not politicians, but leadership.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I will say that again, because politicians are more concerned about the voters. Leadership is more concerned about the future and the future of the country and the people and the workers as well. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were some very good reasons that was considered and had the Prime Minister as Chair of the Mahogany Trust. This is one of the entities that was salvaged from its status during the FijiFirst and the Bainimarama terms in Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The same thing with the Fiji Pine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know it. No one can deny that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Undeniable:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- This is one of the entities that was salvaged:</span> How? Through strong leadership and solid leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Strong leadership, solid leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is what</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 2261 is needed and that is why, it remained in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office because it was in the red. The same thing with Fiji Pine, it was in the red. It cannot run its own operations, Sir. Millions of debts, if I recall, $23 million owed to the financiers. We owe money to FNPF, we owe money to the machine operators, we owe money to other agencies, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Apart from the $23 million. Where is it today? Where is it today, Mr. Speaker, Sir? It took good leadership to salvage this company. HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is it today?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It took good leadership to salvage this company:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hear, hear! (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- We all know the history of Fiji Hardwood and we all know the history of Fiji Pine, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am concerned with all due respect to the honourable Minister, how solid is his leadership to take this institution given what it had gone through? I know for a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that even now in Fiji Pine, the Class A shares, which is mostly the landowners that we want to promote their interest, they are being bulldozed by Class B and Class C shares, which are representatives of Government in that board. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask again, the honourable Minister, how solid is his leadership? I hope he is not easily influenced, because this is an industry that is important for Fiji. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> We need, I have mentioned it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an over-</p><p>reliance on plantations.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mahogany:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> You know what has happened in most of the native forests in Fiji, it is almost gone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost gone. The issue of sustainability in the long-term and that is why it has to remain, and I urge the honourable Prime Minister, reconsider this decision because it is critical. We know how busy you are honourable Prime Minister Sir, but it is important for Fiji, and it is important for the landowners that we fight for, and it is important for the economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> It is not an easy thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he talked about the certification, we know the tightening in market conditions. Sir, on environmental issues, I know what is coming up when this goes to the Minister. There are overplanted plantations as well. Sir, the danger</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>2262 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 in overplanted plantations there are small operators who are working with some of the landowners because landowners sell out of desperation. They do not go through proper consultations and that is why we need to protect this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have strong objections to that, and we hope that the honourable Prime Minister reconsiders because it is important for the country. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry supports the motion and it will debate due to the following reason. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 gives an overarching power to the Mahogany Industry Council which has the power the control the management of mahogany plantation through FHCL. And the engagement of landowning forest base trust under the Fiji Mahogany Trust. This basically brought other private enterprise to buy mahogany process and export timbers which negatively affected FHCL and resource owners. The practice of restrictive mahogany licensing and cooperatively high log price since 2016 has not blend well with the industry performance to date. Under the Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 the FHCL has not been allowed to explore its full potential to expand its business into processing and export mahogany timber overseas. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also repealed the Fiji Mahogany Act 2003 which gives Fiji Mahogany Trust more flexibility to make its own decision on its future direction. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also applies to the Forest Act 1992 in the mahogany plantation. This allow FHCL not to only operate but to regulate its own operation which should be regulated invertedly under the Forestry Act. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also limits the role of FHCL to grow in of the mahogany plantation and selling the mahogany lots. This limits the profitability of FHCL and the owners who leased their land for mahogany plantations under the FHCL. The FHCL should be allowed to process and market its own trees as well to ensure more return as value added product rather than selling only primary product in forms of log. Fiji Pine, on the other hand, assists the company - Tropik and pine product which allows more economical management and the plantations higher returns to landowners. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 encourages Fiji enterprises through its mahogany industry, licensing and planning their 2011 to promote the mahogany brand through its licence customers. But very little is done facilitating landowners to actively participate in forest business. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 states the landowners through the Forest Base Trust are given a fair share of return through lease rental and land management fees. However this share is quite small compared to what those private enterprise are receiving from export mahogany timber overseas. The Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 also have a very little support for the provision of initiative availability and financial facilities that could enable landowners to enable meaningful participation in SMEs and Forest Enterprise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry welcome the opportunity discussed in this motion and stands ready to execute the decision in this Parliament. I, therefore, support and commend the motion before Parliament.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 2263 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment to Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 putting the responsibility of the mahogany industry in the hands of the experts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have heard me talked about turbo-charging the economy in this Parliament or supercharging the economy, Sir. This industry if handle well will be a contributor to supercharging or turbo-charging the economy.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Get the right people:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They did not do the right thing on the other side:</span></p><p>I am reminded of what they did in the Bible, the parable of the talents in the Bible. They just sat on it, they did not do anything to it. One meeting of that Council in 2010; what are shame! Shameful, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If you look at the trend of revenue, these industry should be a $100 million industry right now in our country. It is not even scraping $20 million at the moment and I think by placing it in the hands of the Ministry of Forestry, we will do the right thing and do justice to not only the industry but to the landowners, the resource owners of this industry. Let me just share some pertinent facts of what the other side did to the Mahogany Industry just to put it in perspective. Some of it was during the chairmanship of the current honourable Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, they amended the Decree, they removed the 10 percent shares of the mahogany landowners vested through FMT. Why? They were saying that they were in for landownersâ€™ rights. Why did you do that? Secondly, weaken the role of iTaukei Trust Board on mahogany leases by enabling the Council to have overriding powers on any matter relating to iTaukei land that are leased for mahogany purposes. iTaukei resource owner, right? Why? Thirdly, weaken the participation of mahogany landowners to have meaningful participation in the harvesting and cartaging of operations. The honourable Minister mentioned it just now, do you see any wealth created amongst the landowners, the resource owners in the Mahogany Industry?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- None:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Absolutely!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Stop lying:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Fourthly, weaken the participation of the mahogany landowners to participate in the processing and export business. I rest my case. Introduced an unworkable licensing system that led to poor decisions by the previous government, to increase the mahogany log prices to unrealistic levels. Oh, they have gone quiet! (Laughter) And mahogany log production at export volumes have been on the decline and the list can go on. I would like to just share two other things when I came back from my travels, I participated in the Mahogany Industry. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Still travelling?</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>2264 Mahogany Industry Development (Amendment) Bill 2023 23 rd Nov., 2023 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in a company that actually started talking about certification of the forest, that was in 2018. The honourable Attorney-General is still talking about no certification. They sat on the certification and the implications were, we lost out on a major market in New Zealand without a certification. They just sat on it, they had no money or no whatever. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- They had no political will to do the right thing by the landowners in the Mahogany Industry. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said numerous times that the previous government was full of talk, but a lot of hot air. This example here, the mahogany industry is a classic example of hot air, lots of talk and no action. I support the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir and the landowners of this country who own mahogany have a promising future ahead of them. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just a few other issues I would like to highlight. Contrary to normal standard best practise for forest sector management, the FijiFirst Party it basically takes out what is the legislative role of the Ministry of Forestry, so what we are doing here, we are reverting that back to where it rightly belongs. The essence of the honourable Leader of the Oppositionâ€™s submission is basically leadership, give it to the person who is the leader. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if am listening correctly, this is what he said. It is only the Prime Minister who has the power, that is the problem with the other side. (Chorus of interjections) Mr. Speaker, if I am listening correctly, this is what he said, it is the Prime Minister who has the power, that is the problem with the other side. All the Ministers and Assistant Ministers, we empower them. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- What about them? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- It is not a one man rule! Gone are those days! (Laughter) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Thereâ€™s a new political order we are creating here! (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- The civil servants are the advisors. As Ministers we go, we listen, we empower them, we give direction, we do not dictate what they used to do, so that is what we have created today. Fiji will benefit, the iTaukei will benefit, the forest industry, the mahogany plantations, the entire country will benefit from this Bill. I endorse it, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) Question put.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023 2265 Votes cast: Ayes Noes Not voted - 4 - 27 - 23 Motion agreed to.
