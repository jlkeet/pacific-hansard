BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on Levuka Town Council for years 2012 and 2013 which was tabled on 12 th September, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Levuka was the first municipality that was proclaimed in Fiji after the passing of the Town Ordinance in 1877. Through this, the residence of Levuka were given the right to govern the town thus appointing wardens to oversee the work being carried in Levuka. However, changes came into effect after Independence when the Local Government Act of 1972 was passed, giving all townships in Fiji municipality status and the power to elect their own town councils, councillors and mayors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the year 2012 and 2013, the Council highlighted a few events that was quite significant for them. For instance, these were courtesy visits from the Special Administrator Rakiraki for Levuka/Rakiraki Tourism Partnership. The visit from the Director of Local Government and Chief Executive Officer of Nadi, the Minister for Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment and the Parliament Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to the above, the Council carried out the following activities. They launched the nomination dossier and later Levuka Town was inscribed in the World Heritage Listing. They also hosted the arrival of the Uto ni Yalo and increased human resource capacity to enhance the services provided by the Council. The Committee acknowledged the work carried out by the town council in 2012 and 2013. It also noted the challenges and opportunities that Levuka can build on to boost its economic viability and its status as a municipal council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that the Council build on the Private-Public Partnership model and strengthen partnership with civil society organisations to improve the image of Levuka as a heritage site. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I also have a list of speakers before me and four speakers have been identified. The batting will be led by: 1. Honourable Viam Pillay; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 3. Honourable Premila Kumar; and 4. Honourable Assistant Minister of Finance. Honourable Members, as soon as the first bell is sounded, we will humbly ask you to resume your seat. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to give a few remarks on the Consolidated Review of Levuka Town Council’s Annual Report for the years 2012 and 2013. I know it is an old report and a lot has been said about Levuka, so I will be very brief.</p><div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Levuka Town Council 2012 &amp; 2013 Annual Reports 2279 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka Town Council’s vision to preserve the heritage of Levuka for sustainable livelihoods and its mission to promote economic growth through partnerships and efficient service delivery resonates deeply with the aspirations of our nation. The Committee’s recognition of the Council’s effort in hosting notable events, receiving courtesy visits and achieving World Heritage Listing status is a testament to the significant strides taken by Levuka in preserving its cultural and historical richness. The launch of the nomination dossier leading to Levuka Town’s inclusion in the World Heritage Listing is a milestone worth celebrating. It not only recognises the historical significance of Levuka but also positions it on the global stage as a custodian of cultural heritage. Such achievements underscore the importance of local governance in shaping the identity and the reputation of our municipals. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to provide some insights and also address the august Chamber on the motion before us which is on the report provided by the Committee. the Chairperson and Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give my comments this evening, I wish to extend my appreciation to the assessment and constructive recommendations. Furthermore, I also thank the Special Administrator, CEO and staff of Levuka Town Council for diligently serving the people of Levuka. the Committee Members for Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka was the first capital of Fiji and the recommendation given by the Committee is timely because it encourages more participation with the private as well the public to promote some of the developments that happened in Levuka. Based on the size of the Council, it needs the cooperation assistance of the civil society as well as private organisations to assist in the development of Levuka Town. Recognising effective collaboration stringent on open communications subjective and mutual respect and the Ministry is committed in enhancing partnership to elevate the image of Levuka’s heritage sites. It is also pertinent to highlight a note the significant aid provided by the Government of Japan to the Levuka Town Council. This include essential equipment such as garbage trucks, ride- on lawn mowers, skipper trucks and more not only supports the Council but also generates additional revenue through hiring. The Government of Japan’s assistance in building seawalls post-cyclone destruction underscores their commitment to Levuka’s wellbeing. Furthermore, under the UN Women’s Market for Change Project of $400,000 has been co- funded for the construction of the new Levuka Market. The Ministry stands in support of civil society organisations committed to preserving our cultural heritage. We are so blessed that Levuka is one of the sites because of it being the first capital of Fiji. In conclusion, I express my gratitude for the opportunity to respond to the motion before us and from the Ministry’s perspective, it looks forward to continue to support the operations of Levuka Town Council. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this motion. Levuka’s rich history is easily identifiable by having among the first of many things; the first trading hub, the first schools and hotels, the first banks and post office, the first police station, the first church, mosque and mandir, the first market and the first capital of Fiji. This is a huge part of Levuka’s historical identity for Fiji. It was in Levuka that education, politics, trade, investment and other things began to take shape. It is worth noting that Levuka Town Council was the first municipality proclaimed in Fiji which dates back to 1877. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2013, was a momentous year for the people of Levuka, when Levuka was</p><div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div><p>2280 Consolidated Review Report - Levuka Town Council 2012 &amp; 2013 Annual Reports 23 rd Nov., 2023 listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just after three years of being declared a UNESCO Heritage Port, TC Winston in 2016 and subsequent cyclones damaged majority of the historical buildings, in total, about 76 buildings were destroyed at that time, including seawalls and other monuments in Levuka. This was a major setback for a small town. It is to be noted that Fiji faced 14 cyclones from 2016 of different strengths, example, TC Harold, which was Category 4 and TC Yasa, Category 5. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite all the cyclones, at that time the FijiFirst Government tried to do its best to uplift, repair and restore Levuka. The Committee’s recommendation is appropriate because Levuka is a small town, the community there is close knit, and they want to promote Levuka as a tourist destination. But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be noted that, Levuka Town Council is not in a financial position to look after Fiji’s only heritage town on its own. They barely have about 152 ratepayers, and they are limited by other resources, so, there is a greater dependence on the National Government, NGOs and other development partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka Town Council barely collects around $150,000 in rates, and through other fees and charges, they can come up to around $400,000. There is absolutely no way and maintain the historical sites and provide basic services, when it collects such a small amount of money. Levuka is our pride, Fiji’s only world heritage site, so we must continue to invest in the upkeep of the infrastructure as much as we can. The FijiFirst Government had been supporting the heritage town, to restore the seawall and the road. Mr. Speaker, Sir, every year, Levuka Town Council was receiving around $200,000 from the Government to manage their operations. As we have heard from the Minister, the FijiFirst Government also, at that point, designed and started working on the new and modern Municipal Market, and the reason why this was being done, was for two purposes: 1. Municipal Council can start collecting fees etc. and they can slowly become self-sufficient; and 2. To allow the vendors from nearby islands to come to Levuka to sell their produce. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, with the help of the Government of Japan, we managed to secure a nine-tonne tipper truck and a 5.7 tonne excavator. With these two machineries, they are not only managing the dumpsite, but they are also hiring it out to the ratepayers at a cost. They pay money, and that is another additional revenue for the Municipal Council. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs and support staff, for reviewing and finalising the Levuka Town Council Annual Report for the 2012 and 2013. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka Town Council through the Ministry of Local Government, has received a total of $5.3 million over the last 11 years. The substantial amount that we have seen here was in – • • 2012 - $500,000; 2013 - around $210,000;</p><div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Consolidated Review Report - Levuka Town Council 2012 &amp; 2013 Annual Reports 2281 • • • • • 2014 - same amount of $210,000; 2015 - Fund for Challenge Investment Fund around $62,000; 2016-2017 - Drainage and Flood Mitigation - $50,000, Challenge Investment Fund around $299,000 and the completion of the Levuka Market; 2022-2023 - around $1.7 million; and 2023-2024 – we have budgeted around $1.37 million. So, the Government has supported Levuka Town Council for the last 11 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a comment on Recommendations (6), that is the Councils should build on Public-Private Partnership Model and strengthen the partnership with Civil Society Organisations to improve the image of Levuka as a heritage site. This collaborative approach envisions a concerted effort between the Private Entities and Civil Societies, to leverage resources, expertise and community development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Levuka Town Council, is impacted by the deploring state of infrastructure. Our heritage site is in a deplorable state currently. A once, booming economy is now in a battle against aging infrastructure. With businesses relocated and people migrating to other parts of the country, this has resulted in the reduced number of ratepayers leading to economic down-turn of the town. Sir, the Coalition Government recognises this problem and is looking at ways to assist Levuka Town Council, also having the Municipal Elections and having elected members will be better planned for the towns and cities including Levuka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 2013, the Council recorded an operating deficit of $64,000 and also into 2014 and 2015, owing to maintenance of properties, roads, drains, streets, streetlights and the payment of salaries and wages. They need Government and other grants to support itself to make surpluses, every year. The previous Government neglected Fiji’s heritage site, Levuka. I have been told that Levuka, despite being isolated from the centre business district, is one of the most serviced town with a record of 26 ships serviced per week. The economy is surviving on the operation of the Pacific Fishing Company. Mr. Speaker, Sir, heritage tourism has been noted to be one of the desired tourism in other countries, but our first Capital fails to attract tourists. Levuka Town is also exposed to environmental degradation, which leads to depletion of Fiji’s natural resources. The human factors lead to environmental degradation, Sir. I wish to speak for a few minutes on the financial accounts, which needs to be updated. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, to speak in reply. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wish to thank the honourable Members that contributed to the motion before the Parliament, noting the Reporting here. Levuka Town Council has been encouraged to work towards to the submission of their pending Annual Reports. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p><div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div><p>2282 Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2015 Annual Report 23 rd Nov., 2023</p></body>
