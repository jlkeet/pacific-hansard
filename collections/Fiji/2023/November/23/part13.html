LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, fellow Government Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today to deliver my Ministerial Statement on the country’s largest and one of the oldest hospitals, the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, which is celebrating its 100 th birthday in nine days’ time.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2195 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Colonial War Memorial (CWM) Hospital, as we fondly call the hospital by, celebrates its century of existence on Saturday, 2 nd December, 2023. This will be a proud moment for the Hospital and the Ministry and as the Minister for Health and Medical Services and a former staff of CWM Hospital, I am indeed proud to be part of the celebration of this achievement by an iconic health facility for the nation and the region. The CWM Hospital is not the oldest health facility in Fiji however its achievements and contribution to the health of the people of Fiji over these 100 years is most certainly worthy of our acknowledgment and appreciation. On a brief history of CWM Hospital Mr. Speaker, Sir, the original colonial Hospital was located at Levuka the Old Capital of Fiji in Ovalau built by the local business community with the support of the British Subjects’ Mutual Protection Society in the 1860s. In 1894, the Hospital was then relocated to Walu Bay in Suva, some 12 years after the Capital was officially relocated from Levuka Town to Suva Town in 1882. In 1918, the deadly Spanish influenza pandemic that caused a high number of sickness and the demise of about 5 percent of the population in Fiji put a lot of pressure on the Hospital. The Hospital was overwhelmed with cases and temporary hospitals were set up in the nearby schools and halls around Suva to cater for patients coming to the Hospital. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was reported that from this experience, the then Government considered building a new and bigger hospital. With the end of World War I in 1918, the decision was made to build the new hospital as a memorial to Fijian citizens who served in the war - hence the name, “Colonial War Memorial Hospital”. In 1923, the new CWM Hospital was constructed and completed with the aid of £319,500. It was officially opened by the then Governor of Fiji, Sir. Cecil Rodwell on 2nd December, 1923. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the time of its opening, the new Hospital boasted a total of 108 beds with a staffing of two doctors and a total of 27 staff. Out of the 27, 17 were European staff and 10 were native staff, as they were called then. The new CWM Hospital contained an out-patient department, administration offices, inpatient ward beds for 28 Europeans and 80 natives, kitchen, laundry, operating room, x-ray room, clinical laboratory, nurses’ home, and lecture room. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an interesting and probably not well-known bit of the history of the Hospital is that the Hospital was said to be the brainchild of Sir Henry Marks, an Australian born businessman of Jewish descent, and Legislative Council member, who personally donated £5,000 towards its founding and gave another £5,000 through his company. Mr. Speaker Sir, Sir Marks, who was then elected as Mayor of Suva from 1926 to 1930, also held the rank of Major in the Fiji Volunteer Force, before being made Honorary Colonel of the Fiji Defence Force in 1937. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CWM Hospital today, as we have witnessed over the 100 years, the Hospital has evolved and expanded its services. The Hospital’s infrastructure has expanded tremendously from the original ferro-concrete building which constituted the current West Wing of the Hospital. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Hospital now has more than 500 inpatient beds and a workforce of more than 2000 workers and the scope of health provided by the hospital has expanded manyfold. Tertiary healthcare services like those available in tertiary hospitals abroad are now provided at the hospital by well trained and competent Fijian healthcare workers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Hospital has continued in its teaching role, which started when the Colonial</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>2196</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Hospital was in Levuka and continues to this day. Preparing the regions next generation of health practitioners through hand-on training for thousands of undergraduates and post graduate trainees in medicine, nursing, dental, allied health, health management, support services, and even including training from well-developed countries around the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the century of services, many millions of Fijian citizens have been born, cared for, had consultation, treated, reviewed and discharged from the hospital. As the referral hospital for the Central and Eastern Health Divisions, the hospital has ably provided health services to people referred for admission at the hospital, as well as conduct outreach visits to many islands in the Eastern Division as well as to the communities in Rewa, Tailevu and the interior of Naitasiri. In addition, Medical Specialities from CWM Hospital continue to carry out outreach visits to the Western and Northern Health Divisions of the country, taking specialist medical services close to the population in these divisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2021, the hospital also faced a very similar challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic, to the Spanish flu-pandemic that the original hospital faced in 1918. The CWM Hospital responded effectively and contributed immensely to the Ministry’s overall successful response to the pandemic. On infrastructure improvement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing the aging infrastructure at CWM Hospital has been a real challenge that previous governments have attempted to address. The Hospital currently has a total of 14 buildings of varying ages. Those buildings that are 20 years and older require significant infrastructural improvement works. A number of infrastructure assessments have been done over the last decade and some repair and renovation works undertaken. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to undertaking the necessary works to address the infrastructure needs for the hospital and is utilizing our allocated resources as well as liaising with our health partners for technical assistance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the World Bank’s assistance a Structural Assessment Project was approved in June 2023 and is in progress for the Hospital. A structural retrofitting assessment is to determine which buildings are suitable for refurbishment or extension, and to delineate the necessary structural interventions required to improve health services, safety, climate resilience, and compliance with national building codes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an initial scoping mission was completed in October this year and it has identified eight out of 14 buildings as eligible for structural integrity and retrofitting assessments and further prioritization of the building is underway by the Ministry. A full detailed assessment under the project is anticipated to commence in January 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the assessment report will assist the Ministry to prioritise the most urgent retrofits of CWM Hospital for consideration in our next annual budget proposal, while feeding into the long-term master planning for health services delivery in Fiji. In addition, the ongoing “Health Sector Review” that the World Bank is assisting the government is expected to provide additional information that would inform the master planning process that is required for the hospital. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Centennial celebration CWM Hospital board of visitors have been working hard and supporting the Medical Superintendent - Dr Luke Nasedra, the proud son of Wainibuka and the Hospital Management in the celebration programme. The Board Members are led by the Chairperson, Dr. Esther Williams are volunteers and are putting in a great effort to support the Centennial celebrations for the Hospital. The Centennial celebration was formally launched on</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2197 Remembrance Day 11 th November, 2023 at the CWM Hospital and it was fitting that the Hospital hosted ex-servicemen from the Republic of Fiji Military Forces on the auspicious occasion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the celebration programme includes: Planting of 100 trees around the Hospital compound. 1. 2. A planned clean-up campaign for the Hospital scheduled for Saturday 25th November, 2023 which I hope to see you all there. 3. A sports day for the Hospital staff planned for Saturday 2nd December, 2023. 4. The Open Day for the Hospital on 13th to 15th December, 2023 to be held at Albert Park. 5. A Gala Dinner and Ball to be held on 16th December, 2023 to acknowledge the Hospital staff and the stakeholders. I look forward to the support and participation from all honourable Members of Parliament at the various activities of the Centennial celebration, Sir. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, CWM Hospital launches into the Centennial celebration, we also acknowledge and pay our deepest respect to those dedicated Hospital workers who worked hard and gave their best in delivering health services from the Hospital in these 100 years. We pay tribute to the former Medical Superintendents, Matrons, Consultants, Doctors, Nurses, Dental Officers, Allied Health Practitioners, Ward Assistants, Drivers and other Support Service workers, for the yesteryears, many of whom have since passed on while some are still with us today. We also know that some of their descendants have come back to serve at CWM Hospital and some are still here today. The Ministry remains committed to supporting the role of the Colonial War Memorial Hospital to carry on the legacy of services and caring irrespective of age, gender, economic status or belief in the next 100 years.</p><h4>Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to deliver my Ministerial Statement. Vina’a</h4><p>valevu. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Good morning. Mr. Speaker. Sir, I rise to respond to the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services Ministerial Statement. I thank the honourable Minister for the Statement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Ministry of Health and Medical Services intend to celebrate the Century of the old Colonial War Memorial Hospital. No doubt the old wing of the CWM Hospital has played a pivotal role in serving the people of Fiji throughout its 100 years of existence. It is essential to acknowledge the challenges posed through the progression of time and changes in Occupational Health and Safety Regulations among other international hospital standards to address them effectively. The West Wing of the CWM Hospital houses various clinical facilities as alluded to by the honourable Minister including some private wards, the ANZ Ward, the Rewa Ward and the Lau Ward. It also house some of the Matrons office, the main switchboard for the Hospital, Physiotherapy Department, the JB Savou Dental Teaching Clinic for the School of Medicine, the Urology Clinic and also the CWM Dental Clinic. Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering the significance of this historical building it is imperative to conduct a thorough evaluation to address the multiple issues concerning the infrastructure. If the</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>2198</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 Coalition Government wants to keep this 100 years old building, then it is imperative, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, to do a thorough assessment of the building. I asked our honourable Whip whether the CWM Hospital is part of the National Heritage Site because I was thinking we could do something like MHCC, to keep the face, but he said, “No, not at the moment”. So, in the status, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the infrastructure is no longer compliant to the Fiji Medical and Dental Council accreditation standard. The challenges of infection control is an ongoing issue in the building, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Currently, the Physiotherapy Department operates from the end of the East Wing, which is along the Extension Street, down to the other New Wing of the Hospital. In addition to improving the West Wing it is crucial to provide suitable office for the Nursing Unit Manager and staff, given that the inpatient wards and Dental, Physiotherapy and Urology Units also require a facelift, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, over the past century, the dental profession and the services provided in the Dental Department of CWM Hospital has evolved immensely. The service demand by patients and the different modalities of diseases that are presented to the clinic has also changed from its initial size, and the services that were provided in the Dental Unit from the starting has now changed. Also, in the past 100 years, dentistry has evolved in a phenomenal phase globally, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With the support of the Bainimarama and the FijiFirst Government, it assisted the Fiji National University to develop a speciality training - Post-Graduate Training for Dentists, who are now qualified but still serving as normal Dental Officers in the Hospital because of the need to review staff establishment due to the increasing population and the demands of service, and also to remunerate the Post-Graduate qualification and the speciality of care that they are now providing to Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, I urge the honourable Minister to look into the staff establishment for CWM Hospital. Also, at the moment, our Prosthetic Unit is operating from Nakasi Health Centre. They were relocated there because of the OHS issue with the old Children’s Hospital - the wooden building across the road from the Mortuary. We need to bring the prosthetic service back to CWM Hospital to attach to the clinical services so that patients do not have to travel that far to and from for the completion of their dental care. Mr. Speaker, space is an issue in CWM Hospital and we hope that the honourable Minister, in their scoping and also in their plan, would consider the plight of the CWM Hospital Dental Unit. It is important because CWM Hospital Dental facility is the main referral centre for all dental cases that cannot be treated outside of Suva. We have graduates who have done their Post-Graduate training that have also earned their licence for speciality service for dentistry but are not remunerated as such, and I had indicated this to the honourable Minister and I hope that he would look into it. Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement and I hope that the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance will give the necessary funding support for the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services to be able to uplift the healthcare services, especially at CWM Hospital, so that we can look forward to a new face of CWM Hospital. By prioritising this improvement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health can retain and enhance the historical significance of CWM Hospital for future</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2199 generations. I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement and I thank you for this opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management to deliver his Statement. Development Programme for the Rural and Maritime Communities and Support from Development Partners HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, our distinguished guests in the gallery and I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Malcolm Patterson of the Australian High Commission as well as Ms. Rebecca Brown, who are good friends of Fiji; vinaka vakalevu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today in this august Parliament to provide an update on development programmes for the rural and maritime communities. Supporting our Fijians through various programmes is one of the core principal activities of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, the other being coordinating disaster management operations, which I had already discussed earlier in the week. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, the Ministry’s development programmes have been expanded to include: • • • Rural Housing Assistance with a budget of $3 million; Seafaring Entrepreneurship Assistance Subsidy with a budget of $0.5 million; and Rural and Outer Island Development Programme with a budget of $2.5 million. The other existing programmes are: • • • Self-Help Programme with a budget of $1 million; Community Access Road, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF) with a budget of $2 million; and High Risk Water and Sanitation with a budget of $0.8 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to the end of the 2022-2023 financial year, the Ministry solicited applications through an online portal for those requiring assistance under the three new programmes. Applications received were then shared with the Divisional Commissioners’ Offices for validation of information and assessment to determine the scope of assistance required. In a span of three months (August, September and October), the Ministry was overwhelmed with almost 6,000 applications. Breakdown of these applications were: 1. 2. 3. Rural Housing Assistance - Seafaring Entrepreneurship Assistance Subsidy - - Rural and Outer Island Development 5,381; 227; and 209. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of Divisions, the number of applications received from the Divisions are as follows: • Central Division - 1,916;</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>2200</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 • Eastern Division • Northern Division • Western Division - 310; - 1,475; and - 2,116. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the SEA Programme, the Ministry of Finance has approved the release of the $0.5 million to the Ministry. The Ministry has already identified 40 recipients from the applications received to be funded from this budgetary allocation, as follows: • Central Division • Eastern Division • Northern Division • Western Division - 8; - 10; - 9; and - 13. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has identified 147 recipients for the Rural Housing Assistance Programme, as follows: Central Division Eastern Division Northern Division - 22; and • • • • Western Division - 44; - 40; - 41. The identified recipients would have been the ones that met the eligibility criteria and selection criteria set out by the Ministry. Included in this list are 12 recipients who are former workers of the Emperor Gold Mine of Vatukoula. There was an agreement by the previous Government for them to be assisted under the Vatukoula Social Assistance Programme, which we have now fully funded. On another note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have received an additional 10 packages of housing materials, transferred from the Ministry of Housing that handled the Rural Housing Scheme previously. These housing materials were funded in the 2021-2022 Budget but procurement were deferred due to COVID-19. The Ministry of Housing has started the procurement of outstanding materials which are now delivered to our Ministry for facilitation of cartage to recipients. We have already arranged to start the delivery of these materials from this weekend whereby three sets of materials will be delivered to the Northern Division and seven sets will be delivered to the Eastern Division. We hope to complete these deliveries by the end of next week. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also in the process of recruiting a Head for Rural Housing Unit and a Senior Technical Officer, who should be appointed before the end of December 2023. The positions were advertised after the Ministry completed a Job Evaluation Exercise and upon the endorsement of the Ministry of Civil Service. The Ministry has received three Leading Hands transferred from the old Rural Housing Unit previously based in the Ministry of Housing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the Rural and Outer Island Development Programme, the Ministry is also working on completing submission for the $2.5 million budget release. In the meantime, the tender process for assets and services required under the programme have already been advertised (hire of machineries, procurement of portable sawmill and procurement of value adding equipment) and remaining ones targeted for advertisement this weekend. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is in the process of recruiting a Head of the Rural</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2201 and Outer Island Programme and a Senior Technical Officer, who should be appointed before the end of December 2023. The positions were only advertised after the Ministry completed a Job Evaluation Exercise and upon the endorsement of the Ministry of Civil Service. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the three new programmes, the Ministry had to use its existing officers to work on planning for implementation and drafting of Operational Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures. The Ministry has already received approval from the Ministry of Finance to utilise 70 percent of the funds allocated for Self-Help Programmes and CARFF, an equivalent amount of $0.7 million and $1.4 million respectively. The Ministry is now progressing on implementing a total of 29 Self- Help Programmes and 39 CAFF projects to utilise the $2.1 million that has been approved. In addition to the above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry recently received approval for the release of $0.8 million for the implementation of 43 Hire Risk Water and Sanitation Projects across the four Divisions - 13 Ecological Purification System Water Projects and 30 Sanitation Projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UNDP Gov4Res Project has been a valuable development partner for the Ministry since the signing of Letter of Agreement (LOA) in August 2020. The Risk Informed Development Programme is a game changer, and we are excited to be the pioneer of this Programme in Fiji and in the Pacific. The UNDP has provided almost $2 million to the Ministry for the implementation of this initiative to support 89 projects that are now being used as a demonstration not only in Fiji but have also been shared across the Pacific region and at the global platform at the DRR Meeting that was held in Bali, Indonesia. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that honourable Members are aware of the Planned Relocation Guideline approved in 2018 and the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Planned Relocation in the Republic of Fiji document endorsed this year. The Ministry has been identified as the lead agency for the implementation of the SOP. A Relocation Projection Unit is expected to be established and this will be managed through the normal budget and planning process. The Unit which is to be secretariat to the Fijian Taskforce for Relocation and Displacement will largely have an administrative function. At present this is currently being managed by the Climate Change Division and (GIZ), the German Agency for International Development Corporation (GIDC). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has an arrangement with the Ministry of the Interior and Safety of the Republic of Korea for the implementation of the Saemaul Undong. This is a concept that has been implemented in Fiji since the signing of our Memorandum of Understanding in 2018. Three communities namely; Silana and Naimasimasi in the Tailevu Province and Mau in the Namosi Province, had been selected for piloting the concept, and various development projects have been implemented in these Villages for the past three years. The Ministry is working on applications for funding for new projects for the next budget cycle of the SMU Korea (2025-2029 budget years). In addition to Saemaul Undong, there is another programme called the Saemaul Geugmo, which is a community based financial model and focuses on communities’ sustainable financial development through savings and self-help development through cooperative principles. The Ministry of Interior and Safety of the Republic of Korea has supported active ODA</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>2202</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 projects such as the on-site study, individual training, consultation on an establishment and operation of pilot Saemaul Geugmo programme in developing countries. The Saemaul Geugmo projects have been implemented in developing countries, including Myanmar, Uganda and Laos by the Korean Federation of Community Credit Co-operatives (KFCC). The KFCC is now intending to conduct such programmes in Fiji. This augurs well with the Government’s vision of encouraging MSMEs and their sustainability to support our local communities and improve living standards and economic growth. Another regional organisation that the Ministry is working with is through its membership in the Centre for Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP), which provides technical support and promotes innovative best practices on sustainable integrated rural development amongst member countries in Asia-Pacific in order to improve the lives of the rural people. The CIRDAP also provides training for member countries in different thematic areas, including integrated rural development, governance, sustainable development, economic empowerment and socio audits, to name a few. The Ministry has developed a template or guideline to assist communities in formulating their development plan. This is to ensure that communities are better able to plan and coordinate their development priorities so that there is a more cohesive approach towards development and resourcing. Last but not the least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst I appreciate the support provided by the Government towards the rural and maritime communities of our nation, I believe that it is time that we, as a Government, must work together on changing the mindsets of our people. Over the past 16 years, a culture of dependency syndrome has been developed. This, obviously, drains out resources that can be better allocated towards efforts of poverty reduction and investing in education for our future generation, for instance. There has to be a concerted effort between the Government, development partners and the private sector, towards building the best capacity of our rural and maritime citizens to have confidence in themselves, make productive use of the resources that they own, and reinvest in their respective communities, thereby, contribute the economic growth. There must be a change in mindset, a total paradigm shift, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In planning for development at community level, this is an area that I intent to focus on in the next 12 months. Our people must be encouraged to instil a culture of wealth creation and innovation from an early age. We should not underestimate the capabilities that already exist in our communities - women and youth empowerment, and even recognising the talents of our children. Planning at the community level should embrace this. I acknowledge the establishment of the Department of Strategic Planning in the Ministry of Finance, and I believe that this will assist in better coordination in planning for development at all levels - national, divisional, district and community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Rural and Outer Island Development Programme and decentralisation of services, and to curb rural to urban drift and transforming the landscape of our communities, the Ministry plans to strengthen guidelines and frameworks for rural development in the next 12 months. This will be done through a consultative approach, not only within the Government, but with all key stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to enlighten Parliament on the progress made</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2203 with regards to the development programmes for our rural and maritime communities. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, I would like to adjourn Parliament for tea. But before doing so, I would like to acknowledge, once more, those sitting in the gallery. I have been informed by honourable Ditoka that there are few friends of Fiji here. I understand some are from the Australian Embassy. Could you stand up if you are from the Australian Embassy? (Acclamation) I have noticed our former staff at the Consul General’s Office in Sydney, Orisi, with his fancy haircut sitting at the gallery as well. Welcome, Orisi. No wonder, we have missed you during our recent trip to Sydney. From New Zealand, we have Nina Nawalowalo. Ni sa bula vinaka, Bulou. The last time we met was in Palau, I think. (Acclamation) Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for tea and, please, dear friends, you may join the honourable Members in the Big Committee Room to share some coffee and tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.31 a.m.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2204</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last evening when we concluded, he made a very passionate speech on the Fiji Sports Council 2017-2018 Annual Report and I reminded him that his National Disaster Awareness Week has brought disaster to Albert Park. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ground condition is quickly deteriorating, and I urge the honourable Minister for Local Government to please take particular care about Albert Park. Suva is our capital, Suva is our pride and there has been a lot of investment. I walk around the park almost everyday during dinner time and I am really worried about the condition. MR. SPEAKER.- $10 million for Albert Park.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Yes, Sir, justified.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the statement by the honourable Minister this morning, again, very well aligns and confirms what I did mention a few years back, the shift in our development paradigm. We had TC Tomas in 2010 - a Category 4 Cyclone; TC Evans, again, in 2012 - a Category 4 Cyclone, let alone all the other calamities that occurred in between and then in 2016 with TC Winston, the change in our development paradigm that we took with us into Bangkok and Tokyo. The way we live is changing, the way we do development must change and, therefore, the way we do partnership must also change and this is exactly what the honourable Minister had stated in his Ministerial Statement this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to see that he is continuing but I differ with his concluding remarks. In the Ministry we inculcated a dependency syndrome in the last six years. I beg to differ on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir because rural development is essential. We have huge potentials in rural Fiji and therefore it is important that we create the environment for rural Fijians. There are constraints, there are challenges, what we as leaders, we as planners must do is convert those constraints and challenges into opportunities because there are huge potentials and opportunities that can only be realised when government creates the environment for our rural people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, the way we live is changing, I have talked about resilience in development, I have talked about sustainability in development and that is why the governance for resilience programme was in place together with the United Nations. It is about risk informed development. Honourable Minister for Works, I drove up to Vunidawa on the day after TC Mal and a suggestion to you, honourable Minister, and the honourable Minister for Rural Development in terms of governance for resilience, we are now still doing the Viria Water Project. I saw the construction of the pipes at the Naqali Crossing and, of course, on the two bridges and into Waila. We need to protect the very end of those pipes as it comes up onto the platform that was constructed to raise the pipes so that it is protected from the elements of the environment. If flooding can take away the Moto Bridge, it can take away those pipes. This is about the resilience in development and I hope when it comes to risk informed development that we can look into that.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2205 Mr. Speaker, Sir, infrastructure development; what do we need to do? Again, infrastructure development is critical. We have to look at the airfields in the rural areas, the jetties in the rural areas, the roading in the rural areas, communication in the rural areas because these are all essential. Essential Services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Social Services particularly health, education, water, I will not go into the finer details. Financial support is very critical. Yes, there were considerations in the last few years to have the same programme as the NDP first in the Eastern Division so that the concerns and the potentials in the Eastern Division can be realised. Of course, we learnt a lot when we went to the islands of Lau. I totally agree with what the honourable Minister is considering about the need for detailed planning. We need to now have specific development plans for every geographic region in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Vatoa is different from Ovalau; Ono-i-Lau is different from Wakaya. So, we need to look at specifically the area, potentials, challenges and what can we do as leaders and as planners to bring those potentials and opportunities into reality. That is why these programmes are so important. Again, I emphasise resilience in development, particularly on housing, we need to get our people out of the poverty cycle. A lot of internal movements, probably I will not call it displacement, but a lot of internal movements came after TC Winston particularly for those who had their homes damaged. Again, this is an investment. We invest in housing. We will get our people out of the poverty cycle and they can use their savings and reinvest into other potentials they have in the rural areas. Saemaul Undong and Saemaul Geugmo (MG), we know what is happening in in those programmes, again just continue with it, honourable Minister. Lastly on Rural and Outer Island (ROI), this is important but the linkage between ROI, Ministry for Women, Ministry for Youth and Sports, Ministry for Agriculture and Ministry for Fisheries and Forestry is very critical. If we are to graduate the subsistence farmers, fishermen and women from where they are with the current level to the semi-commercial level, it is the whole of Government approach and it is the interagency connectivity that is very important for the ROI Programme and it needs to be supported. I do agree with the concluding remarks of the honourable Minister, and I would like to say that continuity and further improvement is necessary in order to fully realise the potentials and the opportunities in rural Fiji that I have talked about. 2 nd Australian Ministerial Visit to PALM Scheme Workers HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, guests in the gallery and those watching on their television or online; I rise to update this august Parliament on the recent Ministerial visit to Fijian workers in Australia, approved employers and the Fijian diaspora from the 21 st October to the 4 th November, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I commence with my Ministerial Statement, I just wish to provide a response to the supplementary question that was asked by the other side of Parliament yesterday on the Volunteer Service Abroad (VSA). Mr. Speaker, Sir, our records show that there are two Volunteer Schemes that the Ministry is engaged in: 1. Graduates Pre-Service or Pre-Employment who are registered as volunteers for training under</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>2206</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd Nov., 2023 NEC and that is where we have 105 of them this year; and 2. Regional Volunteer Scheme whereby our retirees and unemployed are engaged in the Pacific Islands abroad. This scheme has not been operating since 2021 due to budgetary constraints and other government priorities, including COVID-19. The New Zealand VSA Scheme, the volunteer scheme in New Zealand, this is the first time we are signing the agreement with them. It has not been in existence before. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this visit to Australia was to meet with the Fijian workers, approved employers and the Fijian diaspora in the five states across Australia, that is Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria which were not covered in our first visit in March this year. This was to enable my Ministry to hear their concerns and views regarding the schemes and to take appropriate action to resolve that. The areas visited are also those from where most complaints were received by the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our honourable Prime Minister on 18 th October, 2023 signed the renewed and elevated Vuvale Partnership Agreement with his Australian counterpart in Canberra. Under the partnership engagement, Pillar 2 is related to deepening economic relationships and this is where our Labour Mobility Programmes are captured in the document. Through this partnership agreement, we will work closely with the Australian Government to enhance the protection of Fijian workers and strengthen their rights while working in Australia. This includes implementing measures to address issues of concerns pertaining to worker’s welfare and their well-being. Mr. Speaker, Sir, kindly allow me to take this opportunity to reassure our honourable Prime Minister and this august Parliament of my Ministry’s commitment to working closely with the Australian counterparts to ensure that the PALM Scheme continues to benefit Fijian workers and their families while upholding their rights as well. Together, we will strive to create a fair and just working environment for all Fijian workers and strengthen the Vuvale Partnership for the mutual benefit of both countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of issues received by the Ministry on labour mobility under the PALM Scheme resulted from the pathetic attitude of the previous administration for not taking time to visit our workers during their last four years in Government. Remember, I am talking about the last four years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to set the record right, honourable Koroilavesau and honourable Usamate visited the workers during their terms like I am doing, but I cannot say the same about honourable Bala. He once visited the RSC workers in New Zealand who go there for only eight months from 7 th to 11 th July, 2019. No PALM worker was visited.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Look after the workers of this country:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- That is exactly what we are doing:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I do not think so:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. K. K. LAL.- Levu na vosa! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in achieving this the Fijian Government through representation by my Ministry and the Fiji High Commissioner to Australia held meetings with the</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>23 rd Nov., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2207 Australian Minister responsible for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, Honourable Tony Burke and the Assistant Secretary for Pacific Labour Policy and Engagement of the Pacific under the Department of Foreign Affair and Trade, Ms. Carli Shillito discussing labour mobility issues and the way forward including minimisation of social impacts on the families. The meeting aimed at strengthening collaboration and cooperation between the two countries in the field of labour mobility and shared economic development, also identifying gaps and finding appropriate solutions to strengthen the programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during this meeting, both my Australian counterparts and I discussed a range of key issues on the terms and conditions of employment, compliance with minimum standards, skills training and assessment and expanding opportunities for workforce collaboration, funding of the Country Liaison Officers (CLOs) and local training institutions for industry skills development. Both countries reaffirmed their dedication to the PALM Scheme and expressed their intention to further strengthen ties with mutual interest in addition to the Ministry putting together a governance structure for the CLOs and proposed case officers and Community Connections. This organisation is working with the Australian Government to assist our workers in Australia to further reach out to workers with issues and provide support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have conducted a meeting with some approved employers who have engaged Fijian workers under the PALM Scheme. The meeting aimed at addressing any key concerns that may have arisen during the workers employment in Australia. This meeting was crucial in fostering a positive working relationship and ensuring that work rights and wellbeing of Fijian workers are protected. The Ministry is committed to working closely with the approved employers to uphold the principles of fairness, transparency and respect for workers under the scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had a series of meetings with the Fijian diaspora to discuss the important role they play in assisting our Fijian workers under the Scheme through the provision of proper advice and community connect programmes. I wish to thank our various Fijian communities in Australia for providing valuable support and contribution to our Fijian workers when the need arises and were faced with challenging situations in any alien environment as well as the culture shock that they were faced with. I also extend my sincere gratitude to the respective religious organisations and their pastors for the crucial role they play in providing pastoral care to our workers. The insights and contributions from the Fijian diaspora are incredibly valuable to ensuring the wellbeing and success of Fijian workers under the Scheme and we are committed to working closely with the diaspora for the betterment of our workers. Also, I called upon the Fijian diaspora while we were there, Sir, to work collectively to ensure Fijian workers are all treated with dignity and integrity and free from harmful effects of misinformation to support initiatives that promote their wellbeing, rights and fair treatment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, meeting our Fijian workers after a lapse of three years was an eye-opener. At the same time, I felt a sense of shame and guilt over this matter about the laxity of the previous administration. HON. USAMATE.- Hogwash!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D.

(Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of these meetings was to engage directly with the workers, understand their experiences, address any concerns they have and ensure that they are receiving the treatment and support while in Australia. These meetings were crucial to ensuring the workers’ wellbeing and success under the scheme. The country liaison officer, the first one that we have appointed, accompanied us and noted the concerns that need to be addressed through dialogue with the respective employers and to draw the attention of relevant state agencies to ensure compliance, especially in the areas of work rights and fair work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all Fijian workers visited expressed their sincere appreciation to the Coalition Government for taking time to visit and listen to their grievances. There were occasions where emotions got high, there were tears (tears of joy) as well shed by those workers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I quote what most of them said: “We have not received any Ministerial visitation for the past three years since our deployment in 2021, and seeing the Government delegation present here today, gives us hope that the Government of the day cares for us.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
