<div><span>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Government  in  Parliament,  I  would  like  to  inform  honourable  Members  that  the  Opposition  had 
<br/>submitted their proposed amendments to the Secretariat on Wednesday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2023, but was only 
<br/>read by the staff on Wednesday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, since the Secretariat has received the proposed amendment, we have 
<br/>also  taken  full  responsibility  for  this  unintended  oversight.    The  Opposition  had  directed  those 
<br/>amendments to one of the Executives, who was on urgent leave abroad and did not have access to 
<br/>his emails and the staff had resumed work on the same day that the Standing Orders Committee met, 
<br/>that is, on Thursday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, this submission by the Secretariat was not intended and I, as Speaker, 
<br/>wish to reassure the Opposition that I will call another Standing Orders Committee meeting after the 
<br/>July Sitting, to consider their proposed amendments, along with a few others that may be identified 
<br/>in due course, suffice to say that the Standing Orders is not set in stone and that is the ongoing duty 
<br/>of the Committee, to consider and review proposed amendments in the course of a Parliamentary 
<br/>term.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Amendment of the Standing Orders of the Parliament of the Republic of the Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the 2022 General Election and pursuant 
<br/>to  Section  61  of  the  2013  Constitution,  His  Excellency  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji 
<br/>summoned  Parliament  to  meet  on  Saturday,  24</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  2022.    It  was  on  the  same  day  that 
<br/>Parliament unanimously adopted the Standing Orders of 2019, which was published and gazetted on 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span>  April,  2019.    Subsequently,  Sir,  your  good-self  informed  Parliament  that  the  Standing  Orders 
<br/>Committee would convene to review the Standing Orders and report back to Parliament within 14 
<br/>sitting days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Orders Committee met on three separate occasions - firstly, on 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> March; secondly, on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May; and, finally, on 5</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, respectively. On those occasions, 
<br/>the Committee met and discussed amendments to the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders which has been circulated 
<br/></span><span>to  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  are  necessary  because  they  impact  the  way  Parliament 
<br/></span><span>conducts itself. These proposed amendments relate to the performance, functions and the workings 
<br/>of Parliament.  In considering and reviewing the practices and procedures of Parliament, the proposed 
<br/>amendments which the Committee agreed to are hereby presented to Parliament as mandated under 
<br/>Standing Order 128. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report of the Standing Orders Committee, by Convention, is a functional 
<br/>document. The recommended amendments, as well as the Committee Meeting Minutes are annexed 
<br/>to the body of the Report, and I hereby commend this Report to Parliament as recommended by the 
<br/></span><span>Standing Orders Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
