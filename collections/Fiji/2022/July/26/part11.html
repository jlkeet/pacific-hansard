<h3>CONSIDERATION OF BILLS</h3>
<div><span>CONSIDERATION OF BILLS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the following Bills be considered by Parliament without delay - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Media Industry Development (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 45/2022); and  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Water Authority of Fiji (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 46/2022).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move that the Bills - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)  must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/>(b)  must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committees of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)  must be debated and voted upon by Parliament immediately after the vote on the 2022-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 Appropriation Bill 2022; and 
<br/>that time for the debate be limited to ensure that the Bills tabled today are debated and voted 
<br/>upon during this weekâ€™s sitting of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1591 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as with the previous Bills, this is part of the 
<br/>budget streamlining processes, fixing up numerous laws and also the bureaucracy.  It is also to put in 
<br/>place some new methods of doing operations, in particular the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) and the 
<br/>various challenges, so we will debate that later on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker.  Where do you have the time to do all these?  We 
<br/>have the Consequential Bills and we were given six Bills yesterday to be debated and now you have this.  
<br/>How are we allocating time for all these, Mr. Speaker?  I am at a loss to understand how we are doing all 
<br/>these things - these are laws, Mr. Speaker.   Are we going to make time for this, Mr. Speaker, because the 
<br/>way I see it, the time is all taken up already and we do not know how.  Are there other Bills coming in 
<br/>tomorrow?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, you must make some sense out of our Parliament.  This is really unforgiveable - the 
<br/>way they just bring Bills to be passed this week.  Please, can you tell us how we are going to allocate time 
<br/>to do this, Mr. Speaker, because right now, we see that the programme is congested already?  I mean, this 
<br/>is very perfunctory, very casual in the way they handle legislation in this country, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, let me make it very clear, time in this House is dictated 
<br/>by the Speaker.  There will be time to debate these Bills.  It is my job to ensure that there is time to debate 
<br/>the Bills.  Just make sure that you are here.  Let us make no doubt about that.   Anyone  else  wishing  to 
<br/>take the floor at this time?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There being no-one else wishing to take the floor, I give the floor to the honourable Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I have no further comments, except as you 
<br/>have correctly highlighted, you have to control time and even in the motion itself, we have not restricted 
<br/>any time. There is no time limit.  Normally, in some of the Standing Orders, motions are brought about 
<br/>we say it is one hour debate, there is absolutely no time limit.
