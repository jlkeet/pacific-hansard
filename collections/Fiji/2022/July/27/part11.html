<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call upon the Attorney-General and Minister for 
<br/>Economy, Civil Service, Communications, Housing and Community Development to give his Right of 
<br/>Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I must admit this morning at 4 o’clock when I was trying to cobble together my thoughts for 
<br/>this response, I was very much at a loss to know where to start off from because there have been so many 
<br/>issues that have been raised by the Opposition, so many matters that have actually been left out by them 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1703 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was actually specifically pertinent to the Budget.  There were so many issues that were raised that 
<br/>were completely irrelevant to the Budget and there was so much distortion of history itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is that lack of moral compass quoting from the </span><span>Bible,</span><span> yet saying and 
<br/>doing things that are completely contrary to what the </span><span>Bible</span><span> teaches.  Talking about the present, based on 
<br/>a distorted historical analysis which then perpetuates into today’s contemporary Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the lack of basic economic analysis by the Opposition stems from a couple of philosophical 
<br/>problems. One of them, as clearly demonstrated by honourable Kuridrani when honourable Bulitavu was 
<br/>commenting on the Budget which he thought was a positive response, he actually stood up and objected 
<br/>to honourable Bulitavu saying positive things about the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that he did not do the same when honourable Mere Naulumatua said some positive things. 
<br/>I  note  he  did  not  do  that  when  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro  said  some  positive  things,  he  targeted 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what it also goes to show is that the Opposition have come 
<br/>to  this  Chamber  with  the  view  that  anything  that  is  presented  by  Government,  and  in  this  particular 
<br/>instance in the Budget, must be opposed, irrespective of whether the policy that has been announced is 
<br/>good or not. They have to oppose it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I found this very disconcerting but it again demonstrates 
<br/>the mindset of the Opposition.  Honourable Kuridrani, who I will be referring to a few instances in today’s 
<br/>speech said that the reason why the Opposition did not make a statement on two Members of Parliament 
<br/>who  have  been  convicted  by  an  independent  judiciary  is  because  he  believes  the  judiciary  is  not 
<br/>independent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the same mindset that existed in the previous governments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  warn  the  Fijian  public  that  if  FijiFirst  is  not  in  Government,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>alternative government will be made up of people who will systematically … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- … undermine all independent institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  We  saw  that  happen  in  the  Governments  prior  to  2006,  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular after 1987. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have had members of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- It is irrelevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is very irregular when there is a Right of Reply being made for you to raise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a Point of Order.  What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  What  he  is  talking  about  is  irrelevant  to  the  Point  of  Order  I  made 
<br/>yesterday.  My Point of Order yesterday was that, the honourable Bulitavu was breaching the protocol of 
<br/>this Parliament and irrelevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take a seat.  You made your Point of Order yesterday 
<br/>and I told you that a debate was going on.  We are debating the contents of the Budget, that is what we 
<br/>were doing and he has every right to say that.  The other honourable Members have every right to say 
<br/>what they say.  That was what was happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As I was saying and honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kuridrani, again, has dug himself in a hole, there is no such protocol. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every single independent institution will be under threat by any other political 
<br/>party that comes into Government.  I wish to inform people who work at FICAC, Judicial, DPP’s Office, 
<br/>Fiji Police Force and Auditor-General’s Office; all of their professionalism will be under threat by people 
<br/>such as them.  God forbid if they ever gain power! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to make also is that, the analysis that were taken 
<br/>by the honourable Members, most of it was in fact, very much personalised.  Most of it was not on the 
<br/>Budget itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point that I also wanted to raise was that, the sense of indignation that was 
<br/>made  or  demonstrated  by  honourable  Members  of  the  Opposition  was  very  much  constricted  and 
<br/>restricted because their sense of who should have empathy or who we should have empathy for, who we 
<br/>should assist is only for a selected group of people; whether it is a group of elites or a group of people in 
<br/>one particular ethnic group, that essentially was what their premise was on fundamentally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whereas the difference between a leader like honourable Bainimarama and this party is that, we 
<br/>assist people on a needs basis.  People who need assistance will get it, it is not based on provincialism, it 
<br/>is not based on </span><span>tikina, </span><span>it is not based on ethnicity, whether you are Hindu, Muslim, </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> or Indo Fijian, 
<br/>Rotuman or whatever it is, you are assisted on the basis that you need that assistance.  You are connected 
<br/>to electricity as a result of you not having electricity.  You are given water as a result of not having water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have on numerous occasions by  honourable 
<br/>Members of the other side come to see me at lunch time or morning tea time, asking me to do certain 
<br/>things for them or people who they want to assist.  When I said to them (and they know who they are) I 
<br/>cannot do this because the law does not allow me to do so.  They said, “</span><span>Areh, </span><span>you the Attorney-General, 
<br/>do it”.  What it demonstrates, Sir, is that, if they were to ever hold such positions, they would abuse their 
<br/>positions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is a fundamental issue.  We have seen that happen in previous 
<br/>Governments; it happened.  People threw their weight around.  We had right from after 1987, ministers 
<br/>writing on a back of A4 paper saying, “give this person a loan”, and they would get a loan at NBF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1705 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen previously, Mr. Speaker Sir, people writing on the back of papers to say, “Give 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this person a licence” or “give this person this”; bugger the law, but let us do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Elections Office have just recently issued notices to NFP 
<br/>and PAP about how they breached the law (fundamental breaches), how they have actually lied about 
<br/>certain things, Sir, about how they have used their </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page to spread misinformation albeit 
<br/>was done four years ago but is currently on their page.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Shame, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, encaptures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We know where it is coming from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  encaptures  the  thinking  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outlook towards governance by honourable Members of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is a fundamental issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You know where it is coming from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have some sense … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  … because he is the Minister of Elections, he is the Minister 
<br/>responsible for the Election’s Office, he complains to the Supervisor of Elections, the Supervisor of 
<br/>Elections sends a notice to us, sends a response to us - we have the right.  He is judging what the 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections is saying. We know where it is coming from. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a video from 2018.  He is saying that the law should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be applied retrospectively. That is what he is saying.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- What is your Point of Order?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you say you have the right, he has got the right as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a name issue he is bringing in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He has got the right.  You have the floor, Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this so classically demonstrates the point I was making 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>earlier on.  He says that I am the Minister of Elections …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- I know where it is coming from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  forgets  that  under  the  Fijian 
<br/>Constitution that the Electoral Commission and the Fijian Elections Office are independent bodies.  
<br/></span><span>He forgets to mention the fact that the video in question is on their </span><span>Facebook </span><span>page and does have lies 
<br/></span><span>on it, I will leave it there.  He knows where it is coming from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I want to make, it is 
<br/>the sense of justice that we must talk about.  You can have what we call “form over substance”, what 
<br/>is preferable obviously is substance over form.  You can stand up and pontificate about justice, you 
<br/>can stand up and pontificate about governance and all of that but in your very actions, when your 
<br/>very thinking actually is contradicting to that, that means you are a hypocrite.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many people in this country left after 1987 not because of economic reasons, they left because 
<br/>they felt there was no justice.  They felt that if they were to apply for a job, they will not get it on 
<br/>merit, they felt that if they were to try and get a license, they will not get it because, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, they do not feel a sense of justice - whether it is on provincial basis, whether it is on ethnic basis, 
<br/>whether it is on religious basis, whether it is the basis of cronyism, they left as a result of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are leaving now as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference is that people now feel that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is a sense of justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- People now know that people will be treated equally, people 
<br/>now know that when they apply for jobs there is a thing, for example, in the Civil Service called 
<br/>OMRS.  People now know that just because the honourable Prime Minister is from Tailevu, it does 
<br/>not mean all civil servants will be coming from Tailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1707 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- As the man who he supports said recently in Cakaudrove, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When I was a Prime Minister, 70 percent of the top civil servants were from Cakaudrove”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the point is that, these are the fundamental, philosophical 
<br/>differences  and way of thinking between this side of the Chamber and that  side of the Chamber. 
<br/>Importantly,  Sir,  it  also  demonstrates  that  their  analysis  is  imbibed,  it  is  drowned  in  that  way  of 
<br/>thinking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was very interesting that honourable Gavoka, for the first time in the past eight years, gave 
<br/>a relatively comprehensive take on taxation and obviously we know where that comes from - the 
<br/>people from FRCS who were obviously helping him, former staff who may have left under dubious 
<br/>reasons.  What is really interesting is this, like most of the people from the other side, there is no 
<br/>rationality  in  the  policy.  He  said  for  one  of  the  things  he  will  do,  firstly,  is  that  he  will  increase 
<br/>taxation for Corporates, will go up to  28 percent, then all foreign companies will all go up to  33 
<br/></span><span>percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like everyone in this country to know, all businesses, large, small, 
<br/>micro, medium or whatever, you will pay 28 percent tax.  Those who are even exempt will pay tax, 
<br/>and we also want all foreign companies to know that they will now pay 33 percent tax.  Many of the 
<br/>resorts in Fiji, our own island resorts in particular are owned by foreigners.  So we want them to 
<br/>know, we want their staff to know that they will all pay 33 percent Corporate Tax, and let us see what 
<br/>will happen after that.  Let us see the level of confidence in investing and reinvesting in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point he said is that he was going to get Water Authority of Fiji 
<br/>(WAF)  and  other  industries  to  pay  resource  tax  to  landowners.    Sir,  WAF  is  funded  by  the 
<br/>Government  so  the  Government  will  be  funding  this  tax,  it  is  not  a  private  entity.    The  entire 
<br/>operations and capital expenditure of WAF is funded by Government.  Of course, WAF is not in Lau, 
<br/>so how will the Lauan people benefit from this?  There may be more resources used in one particular 
<br/>province than in some other province.  Will they get the larger chunk of the tax?  What will happen 
<br/>to those people who do not actually have those industries in their provinces, will they get the tax?  
<br/>Will the people who have more resources being used by these entities say, “Hey, you give us the bulk 
<br/>of it.”  Guess, what  it is going to  do?  It  is  going to  lead to  provincial differences.  They have a 
<br/></span><span>formula but they fail to actually tell us what the formula is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we do is we tax people across the board, we exempt people across the 
<br/>board, and those tax revenues are then driven and given to people who need them most.  A lot of 
<br/>taxation  is  derived  from  Suva  and  the  Western  Division,  but  we  use  that  money  to  cut  a  road  in 
<br/>Tawake, Udu Point and give people water in Lau; that is the way it should be.  The point of the matter 
<br/>is this, by trying to do this along these lines will actually be contrary to what we are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I wanted to also make, as I was this morning thinking, I came up with 
<br/>this thought and I said, the present is actually informed by the past.  If we do not understand the past 
<br/>in our present, then our future will be ill-informed, and therefore unstable and even turbulent.  I will 
<br/>repeat this, Sir, the present is informed by the past and if we do not understand the past in our present, 
<br/>then our future will be ill-informed and therefore, unstable, even turbulent, and that is precisely the 
<br/>problem with the Opposition.  They do not want to actually get a true representation of the past.  The 
<br/>entire thesis of the Opposition, the political narrative of the Opposition, in particular, those who argue

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the basis of ethnicity as demonstrated clearly by honourable Waqanika, honourable Tuisawau, et 
<br/>cetera, they have a wrong analysis of what happened in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- That’s a lie.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Let me be frank about this, the two protagonists that have 
<br/>been portrayed in the political landscape in Fiji, prior pre-Independence and post-Independence is 
<br/>this supposed ethnic tension and ethnic threats by Indo-Fijians taking over Fiji.  That is a fundamental 
<br/>premise, if you read all their literature. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Gavoka, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the same weak 
<br/>leader of SODELPA who justified outside this Chamber honourable Bulanauca’s racist comments 
<br/>saying that the honourable Prime Minister was a murderer, saying that the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>was racist, saying that I was a terrorist on the basis, honourable Gavoka said, “he said it because he 
<br/></span><span>feels very passionate about indigenous rights.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is the same way that Mr. Qarase justified Mrs. Caucau’s comments in Parliament when she 
<br/>said  and  I quote,  “Indo-Fijians  are  like paragrass”.  The same philosophy.  He has justified, stop 
<br/>saying “please” because you are a weak leader, you are not based on principles and values unlike this 
<br/>man, Sir.  I will now get back to my point regarding history. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The honourable Attorney-General is generalising as usual… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- … and misleading because he is labelling all of us as racists.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is his perspective …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- You are racist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- … and he is a racist himself.  Let me read this out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, what is your Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- He is misleading here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have made your Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That is his perspective, it has nothing to do with us.  We are 
<br/>entitled to form our own perspective of how we develop. His perspective is his own, it has nothing 
<br/>to do with us.  You develop your own perspective, we do ours.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have all had your say very precisely on the floor 
<br/>of this Parliament.  I heard it, everyone heard it, now he is replying to what you have said.  That is 
<br/>his right.  If he generalises, he generalises.  You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I did not generalise.  I said those people who have said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that, that is where they are coming from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the historical basis of this country because they always talk about land, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have given land and, therefore, you have got to do this, otherwise there will be turbulence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  everyone  knows,  read  facts,  books,  charter  of  the  land;  read  this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Academically written, historically researched, factually basis … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You have not read it, that is your problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is  that  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land was alienated in  this country not  by  Indo-
<br/></span><span>Fijians  but  by  the  European  settlers;  everyone  knows  that.    It  was  alienated  by  the  Colonial 
<br/></span><span>Government.  We are one of the very few countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the colonised period where 
<br/>there was no resistance to European control, British control. It is a fact that some chiefs gave away 
<br/>land to impress European settlers.  It is a fact that some chiefs exchanged land for some muskets, for 
<br/>some guns, or even for some food.  That is a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those land were alienated then, not a single millimetre of land has been ever alienated legally 
<br/>or illegally by Indo-Fijians in this country. Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are seen as a threat. That is a 
<br/>fact. That is how it is portrayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Stop misleading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHIAYUM.-  I want to quote and this is when they wanted to have the 
<br/>right to vote and there was a J.J. Ragg (we all know the Ragg family), he urged one of the chiefs, Tui 
<br/>Tailevu, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We must endeavour to permeate the whole of the Fijian race (meaning </span><span>iTaukei) </span><span>with 
<br/>a fixed idea that the granting of the franchise and equal status to the Indians in Fiji would 
<br/></span><span>mean the ultimate loss of all their lands and rights and later their final extinction from the 
<br/></span><span>phase of the earth”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That philosophy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was engrained very deeply and it resonates in today’s Fiji 
<br/>also. It resonates in the justification of 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>.  It resonates in the justification of the removal of 
<br/>the Chaudhary Government in 2000; that is a fact.  So, if we are to look into the future to build a 
<br/>strong economy and a strong nation, we must rid ourselves, exercise ourselves, get rid of all these 
<br/>ghosts from the past. It is a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Till today in colloquial language in Fiji, if you say to someone, “you are a </span><span>kai colo”</span><span>, it is a 
<br/>negative term, but there is a place called Colo.  There were people from Colo who resisted British 
<br/>control and today, it is a bit imbibed in our culture that if you call anyone </span><span>kai colo,</span><span> it is a negative 
<br/>term.  The people from Colo, there were 70 to 80 people killed.  There was no standing British Army, 
<br/>they brought in </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people from the Eastern Division of Fiji and formed what they called the first 
<br/>native constabulary.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were people from Ra who were exiled to Kadavu because they resisted British control.  
<br/>That  is  not  taught  in  our  history.    That  is  not  understood.    That  is  why,  for  example,  when  Ratu 
<br/>Sukuna did all the provincials, land stuff, Navosa was put together with Nadroga. Navosa was split 
<br/>up into other provinces - that is the reality.  Do not romanticise the past, do not put a narrative that is 
<br/>not true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, till today, have people in Ba, Nadi complaining about the way the land was alienated, 
<br/>different </span><span>i tokatoka</span><span> and </span><span>mataqali </span><span>because of political considerations at that point in time. Please, let 
<br/>us not romanticise because if you do not romanticise, if you talk about the facts, then you can actually 
<br/>have a better future.  We can make the right decisions, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  not  forget  the  fact  what  honourable  Seruiratu  talked  about.  When  the  people  in 
<br/>Monasavu gave up their land for electricity (Monasavu Dam), how much were they paid? They did 
<br/>not even get electricity. This man gave them electricity - let us understand that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they did the Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mahogany plantations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the 1950s and 1960s, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people were paid peppercorn rent - one shilling, two shillings.    
<br/>We fixed it up, in fact, he fixed it up.  So these are the realities that they need to understand.  Let us 
<br/></span><span>shed ourselves of all these nonsense, fabricated narrative about the past.  Only then we will have true 
<br/></span><span>analysis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to make also is (I have said this so many times), 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please read people like Simione Durutalo.  He is one of my heroes actually.  Please read.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Ooh  yes.  Great  man!  You would learn, your world will 
<br/>broaden.  Read people like William Sutherland.  They have a historical narrative of Fiji that was and 
<br/>in fact, the power and economic dynamics that helped develop this colony and what perpetuates till 
<br/>today into our present.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make is that, honourable Bulanauca 
<br/>(this is the same man), and I need to say this again, in 2000 when the Chaudhry Government was 
<br/>slowly being dismantled on an hourly basis, he was standing outside Civic Centre (there is a video 
<br/>of it at  the USP  Library) and said, “The executive, the judiciary  are ruled by the  </span><span>kai  Idia</span><span>, Hindu 
<br/></span><span>tevoro.</span><span>”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Shame on you!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He did that, it is there, he knows that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want him to start standing up and repenting, I know he is not going 
<br/>to do that but my point is this, when you have people with that mindset and the leader of his party 
<br/>defending him, it goes to demonstrate … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Point of Order.  Is this relevant, Mr. Speaker?  It is not relevant. Let 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us move on, please.  Let us talk relevance, it is in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, honourable Attorney-General.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I only raised these issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because they raised it.  If they had not, I would not have.  But …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.-  A Point of Order  on clarification, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned and explained that in this House, nothing is said in a vacuum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So he is justifying what he said, nothing is said in a vacuum.  
<br/>So in other words, </span><span>kai Idia</span><span>, Hindus are </span><span>tevoro.  Tevoro</span><span>, for those people who do not know, means 
<br/>the devil.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Sir,  to  clarify  further,  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economy does not understand what I meant by that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- No, he understands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Let me explain it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- We understand what you want to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- When people say that Native land is to become nationalised and 
<br/>land use across the board without the landowners’ consent, that hurts the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  That is what I said; 
<br/>nothing is said in a vacuum.  When people say things like that, they will say things appropriately, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the honourable Member compels me to respond to him.  
<br/>The government at that point in time under that Constitution could not have taken away land without 
<br/>the consent of the landowners - the land laws were still in place.  It is not justified, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Again, thank you very much.  This brings me to the point 
<br/>that  the  comments  made  by  the  other  side  was  based  on  conjecture  –  everything  was  based  on 
<br/>conjecture.  What if this was there, or the idea is there?  They are saying this, that means it means 
<br/>this.  Right from honourable Professor Prasad, the other day making comments outside saying, “Oh, 
<br/>because Fiji Airways is now going to manage AFL, that means ATS will be affected.”  What has it 
<br/>got  to  do  with  ATS?  “ATS  is  a  union-based  company,  therefore  they  will  get  affected”  –  all 
<br/>conjecture, trying to build this kind of cathartic moment, like some big conspiracy, that is the word.  
<br/>Some conspiracy is going to take place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to also make was about, this way of thinking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gets leaders to start thinking in a dichotomous manner.  Everything is like us and them, basically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- What does that mean? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You should know, you are a smart man. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember once I used the word ‘eschatology’ and you went, “Oh!” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I don’t know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  remember  about  three  years  ago,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations and Youth and Sports was 
<br/>here too but unfortunately he is not here with us because of personal reasons, and we were all standing 
<br/>up  and  talking  about  how  Roy  Krishna,  the  football  player,  had  been  given  some  international 
<br/>recognition and we all congratulated him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Leawere stood up and said, “We must not forget about the rugby players.”  </span><span>Areh</span><span>, 
<br/>how  can  we,  talking  about  and  celebrating  Roy  Krishna’s  achievement  have  anything  to  do  with 
<br/></span><span>rugby players?  We will praise rugby players when rugby players will achieve that, we praise them 
<br/></span><span>all the time.  But you see, there is this thing – if you are going to praise Roy Krishna, who is a football 
<br/>player and is Indo-Fijian, we must cover the other side too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister congratulates people, sports players, we do not suddenly say, 
<br/>“Oh, you must then congratulate the other group too.”  This is their way of thinking, what it means 
<br/>is that, you cannot have nationhood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  quote  a  very  simple  quote  from  one  of  the  founders  of 
<br/>National Federation Party (NFP), the late Mr. A.D. Patel and he said this in the 1960s; “Won’t it be 
<br/>better if we thought less of our race and more of our nationality.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  A  very  simple  quote  by  the  late  Mr.  A.D.  Patel!  The 
<br/>unfortunate thing, of course, now is, today’s NFP leadership does not really believe in that because 
<br/>you joined a person who actually thinks along ethnic lines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those thousands of Fijians 
<br/></span><span>who helped us shape the 2022-2023 Budget.  Indeed, Sir, I would like to thank all those who helped 
<br/>us shape the other four Budgets prior to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Qereqeretabua,  the  other  day,  made  a  very  flippant  comment.    Most  of  her 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comments are quite flippant, Sir, based on sort of sarcasm.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Are you attacking the women?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I am not attacking you, I am attacking all of you, I will take 
<br/>you first.  Are you a woman?  Is honourable Bulanauca a woman?  Is honourable Gavoka a woman?  
<br/>Get your facts right! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua said, “Oh, we are going to do another review in 
<br/>six months.  We have done this review so many times.”  Sir, it demonstrates that under our Prime 
<br/>Minister, the Government is actually responsive and agile enough to changing circumstances.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1713 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are not rigid.  The world is volatile.  No one expected a pandemic. The moment pandemic started, 
<br/>the moment we had our first cases, we did a revision of the Budget because we knew what it would 
<br/>mean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we had figures based from 1920 budget which had projected to have “x” number of tourists 
<br/>because no one expected the borders to close and even though the pandemic came and the borders 
<br/>were closed, our figures would have meant nothing, so we had to revise it. In the same way we have 
<br/>to  revise  this  Budget.  If  tomorrow,  God  forbid,  the  war  spreads  in  Europe  and  changes  the 
<br/>circumstance altogether, are we going to say, “This is the Budget, so let us stick to it.”   No.  You 
<br/>have to respond to it. That level of agility was precisely what saved us from going down the path of 
<br/>many other countries, Sir. We responded to it with agility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We knew, therefore, our foreign reserves will get depleted, we do not have tourists coming 
<br/>in so what do we do? We changed our borrowing methodology. We changed the people we borrow 
<br/>from. We need to build our foreign reserves, otherwise we will not have foreign reserves. We will 
<br/>not  be  able  to  buy  fuel,  medicine,  other  imported  items,  we  did  not  have  that  problem.  Other 
<br/>countries, debt is a different issue, Mr, Speaker, Sir, but you need to have the level of foreign reserves 
<br/>in particular when you are largely an importing country to be able to buy those things. They do not 
<br/></span><span>tell you that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all those thousands of Fijians who helped us.  Given 
<br/>that I have the latitude of time, I would like to also thank all the staff too.  I want to specifically 
<br/>mention the people in Tawake and Loa Villages. We went to those two villages and we were received 
<br/>with a lot of enthusiasm.  I would like to also to thank the women entrepreneurs who participated, 
<br/>the farmers, the private  sector people, civil  society  groups,  Fijian  youths, et  cetera, that  provided 
<br/>suggestions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also thank the staff at the Ministry of Economy, FRCS and also 
<br/>the  staff  at  the  Solicitor-General’s  Office.    What  is  really  interesting  (honourable  Radrodro  you 
<br/>should make a note of this) is that, most of these people are below the age of 40.  Most of them would 
<br/>not be holding these positions if it was not for Open Merit Recruitment and Selection (OMRS). These 
<br/>are young, committed, bright, energetic and qualified Fijian civil servants. From the bottom of my 
<br/>heart, I really wish to thank them, Sir, because the way the Opposition speak, they do not realise the 
<br/>hours  that  are  put  through  this,  the  troubleshooting  that  we  do,  and  the  punching  of  holes  we  do 
<br/>before we present the Budget finally.  . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Permanent Secretary for Economy, Mr. Shiri Gounder, below the age of 40 from a 
<br/>good province of Nadroga. I have to control myself, I do not want to get into provincialism.  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Mr. Mark Dixon, Chief Executive Officer of Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (FRCS),

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like, of course, thank them back and would like to now get into some

<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his  leadership,  guidance  and  his  ability.    I  say  this  unreservedly, 
<br/>unequivocally,  his  ability  to  think  outside  the  box,  the  ability  to  be  agile  and  flexible  to  changing 
<br/>circumstances, demonstrated that no other Prime Minister ever had to do this.  No other Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>has ever had to deal with a pandemic for one year and I would like to really thank him for that, Sir.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are on a strong path of economic recovery and when we  said the “Bula 
<br/>Boom” they made fun of it.  Why did we say the “</span><span>Bula</span><span> Boom”, Sir?  Because we are now welcoming 
<br/>tourists to this country with the big </span><span>bula</span><span> that we are known about.  The big </span><span>bula</span><span> smile, the big </span><span>bula</span><span>
<br/>experience, that is why we are calling the “</span><span>Bula</span><span> Boom”.  We had only 34,000 tourists last year, some of 
<br/>them would be returning Fijians visiting friends and relatives.  We are now going to come to about half 
<br/>a million tourists.  That is a boom.  We are obviously from a low base, but it is a boom, Sir, and they 
<br/>made fun of it.  No matter how much they tried and refute it, that is the fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the figures were revised to 12.4 percent.  We are now looking anecdotally, it 
<br/>may be even more and that is a conservative sum. They made fun of that.  Honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/>said,  no  matter  what  pandemic  or  whatever,  he  said,  you  still  had  a  contraction.  So  in  other  words, 
<br/>tomorrow, if we have an earthquake, if we have a volcano like Tonga did and we then say, the economy 
<br/>will get contracted, Sir, he will then say, “oh, I do not care about the volcano, you still had a contraction;  
<br/>I do not care about other people dying, you still had a contraction.”  This is the level of contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as he knows and everyone knows that the 2022 growth is coming from a low 
<br/>base after a massive 17.2 percent contraction in 2020 and a 4.1 percent contraction in 2021.  Every single 
<br/>country in the world was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We faced our highest ever economic 
<br/></span><span>decline and I will say it again unequivocally, it was because of decisive and strong leadership.  We were 
<br/></span><span>criticised so many  times  when the honourable Prime Minister said we will do  a  lockdown  based  on 
<br/>science and health advice.  We will do bubbles.  They said, “Do not do bubbles, do not do lockdowns.”  
<br/>When we then lift it up, they said, “Do lockdowns, do bubbles.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we heard the word “vaccine”, immediately we went to our development 
<br/>partners.  The honourable Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were on the phone talking bilaterally to 
<br/>different countries saying we need the vaccine.  We were talking to Asian Development Bank (ADB), 
<br/>World Bank that we needed vaccine because we knew there would be what we call “vaccine injustice” 
<br/>because smaller countries would get pushed to the bottom of the line and I need to say this again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If USA is going to go to a pharmaceutical company and say, “with nearly 300 million people, 
<br/>200 million of us need to be vaccinated with two dozes that means 400 million dozes order” – placed 
<br/>with the pharmaceutical company.  Fiji with about 900,000 people, 600,000 people need to be vaccinated, 
<br/>our order is 1.2 million dozes. Who will get priority?  We knew that would happen and because of the 
<br/>efforts  of  the  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  and  also  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Indians  gave  us  the  first 
<br/>100,000 dozes, then the Australians, then the Kiwis, then the Americans and now even the French are 
<br/>giving us dozes.  Every one of you in this room has been vaccinated, you are not paying a single cent for 
<br/></span><span>it, we are as a Government, did not pay a single cent for it. We had to pay for the administration of it, we 
<br/></span><span>had to hire vehicles, we had to pay nurses, we had to send people on boats, on horses or whatever it was, 
<br/>to get to people to vaccinate them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a decisive decision made that if we do not achieve high levels of 
<br/>vaccination, we will not be able to open our economy. No Jab, No Job policy worked, the $360 worked. 
<br/>Yes, that was  a  condition  and  yes,  it worked.   Honourable  Prime Minister  said  we  will open before 
<br/>Christmas, we opened on 1st December and we had our national carrier ready to fly.  If we did not have 
<br/>a national carrier, we will be twiddling our thumbs then Virgin Airways would have said, “oh guys, look 
<br/>we are going to come on 30th December”; Air New Zealand may say, “we are going to come on 19th 
<br/>December”, Qantas may say, “we will come on 30th January”, we would have been left to their whims 
<br/>and fancies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is obviously some kind of gloom and doom theory by the Opposition.  
<br/>Like I said earlier on, everything we did, they had to oppose it and everything was played politically.  As 
<br/>we have said in Parliament before as Bill Clinton said, “Is the economy stupid?” That is what we need to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1717 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rescue, that is what our focus is.  This entire budget has been said as an elections budget.  In fact, elections 
<br/>is far from our thought.  We are primarily concerned, if you look at the gist of the budget, most of the 
<br/>policies that we announced previously, Sir, are continuing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new things are what we call the inflation mitigation, everything else is the same, no changes.  
<br/>Some, yes, adjustments here, forestry’s got a bit more money, certain adjustments have been made in 
<br/>various other Heads but we continue with that. If we wanted to do really an elections budget, we could 
<br/>have done a lot more.  It would have been irresponsible, we  would have been physically responsible.  
<br/>Deficit has been reduced from 12 percent to 7 percent.  We could have said, “Elections year, let us blow 
<br/>it out.”  None of them mentioned that deficit has come down from 12 percent to 7 percent; none of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they, of course, try to discredit what has been called the “Bainimarama Boom”. 
<br/>The fact is, that we have never had nine years of consecutive growth increase.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a 
<br/>fact. Again, honourable Gavoka, please, do not embarrass yourself. Because you are saying borrowing, 
<br/>all governments in the world borrow.  The issue is when you borrow, what are you using the money for?  
<br/>If you borrow and if you are going to borrow money to cut a road in Tawake, connect people to electricity, 
<br/>give people water, build hospitals, build nursing stations that is good news of borrowing money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it is a very fundamental issue, he should know as a former banker which 
<br/></span><span>he says he was.  Honourable Professor Prasad has got a number of assets, maybe some overseas, maybe 
<br/>under other people’s names, I do not know but the fact is that, he has assets.  If honourable Sigarara, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, does not have that many assets, the amount of money that honourable Professor Prasad can 
<br/>borrow would be far greater than honourable Sigarara, it is a fact, its what happens.  The more assets you 
<br/>have, the more capacity you can borrow.  It is very simple, Sir.  If the economy is doing well, financiers 
<br/>see that you have a continuous growth rate, they will be able to lend you money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, none of them actually, Mr. Speaker, Sir, mentioned the fact that our GDP doubled in 
<br/>such a short period of time.  It doubled and there was improvement in income levels.  People have more 
<br/>cars, more homes have been bought, start new businesses, embrace new opportunities, better services, 
<br/>improve life, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the result of the nine years of growth.  Honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/>talks about the marginal economic contraction of 0.69 percent in 2019.  He said the economy was slowing 
<br/>prior to COVID-19, but he conveniently ignores the sustained and strong growth and nine years prior to 
<br/>that.  He goes on about the 0.6 percent.  The world actually went into recession, he does not talk about 
<br/>that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put things into perspective, our real GDP in 2022 is almost 116 percent higher 
<br/></span><span>than what it was in 2006, more than double.  Compared to the year 2000, our real GDP is 263 percent 
<br/></span><span>higher  and  compared  to  1970,  our  real  GDP  is  6,311  percent  higher.    That  is  why  we  called  it  the 
<br/>“Bainimarama Boom”.  Now, of course, we have the </span><span>Bula</span><span> Boom on our coming out of the pandemic and 
<br/>that is despite being faced with the COVID-19 crisis and the natural disasters, they do not seem to mention 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one talks about the 14 cyclones we have had, no one talks about the fact </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span>  wiped  off  one-third  of  the  value  of  our  GDP  in  36  hours.  I  am  glad  honourable  Radrodro 
<br/>acknowledged the fact that the schools we built from the Rebuild Programme - Build Back Better, after 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, none of them got affected.  At least, I thank him for his honesty in that respect and the same, 
<br/>I thank him also for his honesty regarding rural infrastructure roads.  Yes, not everything is perfect.  I also 
<br/>thank him for his acknowledgement how a road from Nadi to Suva through inland Viti Levu would open 
<br/>up opportunities for those landowners, open up opportunities not just for those landowners but other 
<br/>Fijians living in other parts of Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was quite interesting how honourable Lalabalavu does not want to benchmark 
<br/>us against the developed countries like Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, but he wants us to be 
<br/>compared to Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.  This is the level of Opposition we have in terms 
<br/>of  their  contribution,  a  true  reflection  of  the  shallow  depth  of  SODELPA’s  vision  and  leadership 
<br/>capabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Lalabalavu  came  up  with  his  own  figures  for  real  growth,  he  and  his  so  called 
<br/>economy’s friends, we know who they are, do not agree with the credible institutions like IMF, World 
<br/>Bank and ADB on growth projections.  This is really absurd.  In fact, the ANZ as we said, are projecting 
<br/>we will grow by 22 percent, we do not agree with them, but that is their projection and I hope they are 
<br/>right, some miracle gets pulled out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Lalabalavu  also  refuted  the  poverty  numbers  from  the  World  Bank.  Really 
<br/>honourable Lalabalavu?  The Opposition likes to pick and choose commentary from these agencies only 
<br/>when it suits their political narrative and that is the point I was trying to highlight.  They all have embraced 
<br/>a particular narrative, they will not change from it, even though the facts may be staring straight at them 
<br/>in their faces, they will not change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they talked about extreme poverty.  Extreme poverty is defined by the World 
<br/></span><span>Bank, is almost non-existent in Fiji; what we call “abject poverty”.  The poverty rates to the 24.1 percent 
<br/>as per the 2019-2020 HIES.  This was the lowest level of poverty ever registered in Fiji.  In 2002 and 
<br/>2003, poverty rate was 35 percent, in 2008 and 2009, the poverty rate was 31 percent, then it fell to 28 
<br/>percent in 2013 and 2014 and to around 24 percent in 2019 and 2020.  Based on current population 
<br/>estimates, it is clear that under the Bainimarama Government and of course, the FijiFirst Government, 
<br/>almost 100,000 Fijians have been lifted out of poverty.  That is the boom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lifting 100,000 Fijians out of poverty is no ordinary feat.  It is a direct result of nine years of 
<br/>consecutive economic growth and various social empowerment initiatives like free education, equality in 
<br/>employment,  creation  of  thousands  of  jobs  under  the  Bainimarama  Government;  we  had  the  lowest 
<br/>unemployment rate in about 20 years.  They equate growth with debt levels.  It logically does not work.  
<br/>They do not even understand the basics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  we  need  to  continue  to  fight  more  against  poverty,  it  is  not  an 
<br/>overnight fight.  It requires continuous efforts, extra effort from everyone, decisive leadership, strategic 
<br/>thinking and way forward thinking, not only up to the next elections, but five years, 10 years and 15 
<br/>years’ time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have said, the Budget is fiscally responsible.  We have been saying, we 
<br/>have reduced the fiscal deficit from 13.8 percent to 7.4 percent GDP.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio is now on 
<br/>a downward path, declining from around 89 percent this year to 85 percent at the end of July 2023.  Based 
<br/>on our planned fiscal consolidation, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall below 70 percent of GDP 
<br/>by the end of this decade.  There has been so much misinformation and fear mongering by the Opposition 
<br/>on the debt issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I have to go and do this sort of one zero one kind of lesson on debt. We have said it many 
<br/>times and I will repeat it today, the high levels of borrowings during the COVID-19 period was absolutely 
<br/>necessary and appropriate. That is why we had all our lenders and partners supporting us because that 
<br/>was the right thing to do.  Had we not done that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would have had a Sri Lanka kind 
<br/>of crisis much earlier than Sri Lanka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The international media and our Opposition are trying to portray (or some of the elements in the 
<br/>international media) the Sri Lankan crisis as a debt crisis because it suits their narrative.  It is in fact not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1719 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a debt issue.  In fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sri Lankan crisis is more of a foreign reserves crisis and less of 
<br/>a debt crisis.  They had many things before the pandemic.  One of their Ministers decided to overnight 
<br/>say, “no more fertilizer, only organic fertilizer.”  Their agriculture output dropped by 50 percent.  Sri 
<br/>Lanka, with certain products, they never used to import it.  They started importing it because they could 
<br/>not have enough food to feed themselves as they could before. A strain on the foreign reserves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, they are not able to buy fuel, food and other necessities and even 
<br/>medicine because they do not have the exchange, foreign reserves.  They cannot pay their debt because 
<br/>of that.  We, by borrowing more from offshore basically meant (honourable Rasova understands this), 
<br/>that more foreign reserves came in, so we built up our foreign reserves because we knew the foreign 
<br/>reserves that used to come from the tourists, no longer can come because the tourists are not coming and 
<br/>we need foreign reserves to trade.  We need foreign reserves to buy cars, medicines, and buy fuel.  All 
<br/>the three fuel companies in Fiji buy all their fuel from Singapore, they trade in US dollars, we trade in 
<br/>Japanese Yen, Australian dollars and US dollars. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with borders closed and the tourism industry asleep for almost two years, we 
<br/>lost around $3 billion in foreign exchange - gone!  We still had to pay for our fuel bill, pay our medicine, 
<br/>raw materials - all the hardware you buy in Fiji is from overseas, the clothes you are wearing is from 
<br/></span><span>overseas.  It may be sewn here but the fabric is from overseas.  We borrowed almost $2 billion in external 
<br/></span><span>loans  during  this  period,  not  only  for  budget  financing  but  more  importantly  to  sustain  our  foreign 
<br/>reserves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the triple whammy was that we used that money to pay for unemployment benefits for our 
<br/>people.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $432 million was paid out directly.  Those people and I will say this again and 
<br/>I said it in the budget consultations - the lady who sits in the Hilton corridor or in Outrigger who makes 
<br/>handicraft, she no longer had a job. She benefitted from the $90, the two rounds of $50 and the two rounds 
<br/>of $360.  The lady who sells boiled </span><span>ivi</span><span>, roti parcels, lovo pack, </span><span>mithai</span><span> outside the airport to the airport 
<br/>workers, to ATS workers, Fiji Airways’ workers had no longer any business because they shutdown.  So 
<br/>she was assisted.  People in the informal sector were assisted as a result of that.  We assisted our people, 
<br/>we built up our foreign reserves, we did not touch the money internally because there was a strain on that 
<br/>and of course, we built up our liquidity.  Now there is more liquidity in the system which means interest 
<br/>rates will come down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also, of course, as a result of what we are doing, how we were spending the 
<br/>money - the Australian and New Zealand Governments were happy with the fact that we topped-up social 
<br/>welfare, they were happy with the fact that we were rolling out unemployment benefits also gave us 
<br/></span><span>budget support, and we very much appreciate that, Sir.  And of course Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sale of 44 
<br/></span><span>percent of EFL shares helped.  They would not tell you the fact that FNPF made a huge windfall from 
<br/>that, they initially bought 20 percent, the Japanese came and bought it and they made a huge windfall.  I 
<br/>will come to FNPF later on, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, when we say what is your alternative - what would the Opposition 
<br/>have done in 2020?  What would they have done?  No one, right from the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition  to  honourable  Gavoka,  honourable  Professor  Prasad,  none  of  them,  though  political 
<br/>opponents are outside, none of them have said what they would have done in 2020.  What would have 
<br/>been their formula to be able to arrest the situation that arose as a result of the pandemic?  What would 
<br/>have been the economic formula they have because the borders were closed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, they cannot say, “this is our secret” - the event has passed, you can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tell us.  It has got nothing to do with the manifesto.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, you cannot say that we would have told you because it has gone.  What would  you have 
<br/>done?  We are not asking you to tell us what you are going to do but what would you have done?  Not a 
<br/>single person said that.  Honourable Professor Prasad said to cut civil service pay, published in the </span><span>Fiji 
<br/>Times</span><span>, cut 10 percent pay.  Honourable, not honourable, I wanted to say honourable, he is no longer, well 
<br/>never was honourable - Narube said that we should cut down the civil service size, reduce the hours.  All 
<br/>of them said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Till today, and honourable Prasad has the gumption to argue about 
<br/>this but he has not told us what he would have done.  Not what he is going to do, what would he have 
<br/>done, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the debt issue - Fiji’s debt level is at sustainable level.  This has also been 
<br/>confirmed  by  credible  international  institutions  like  the  IMF,  World  Bank,  ADB,  ANZ  Bank  and 
<br/>international credit rating agencies.  I would like to urge all Fijians - please do not be misled by these 
<br/>people or the people outside.  You can see the results on the ground.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, credible lenders 
<br/>like  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank  (AIIB),  Japan  International 
<br/>Cooperation Agency (JICA) and others are willing to lend five times more than what they did before.  
<br/>This  simply  means  they  have  the  confidence,  Fiji  will  be  able  to  pay  its  debt  and  debt  levels  are 
<br/>sustainable.  No lender would lend to a person or country if they thought the borrower would not be able 
<br/>to repay back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lalabalavu claims that ADB has said that Fiji’s debt is unsustainable.  That is not 
<br/>true, Mr. Speaker, Sir - if it was true, why is ADB still lending to Fiji.  They wanted to lend to us also for 
<br/>the Nadi River, but we said we did not want it because we have a difference as to how we should mitigate 
<br/>those risks regarding whether we should do dredging or build flood plains.  Why would someone lend to 
<br/>you if you cannot pay back, honourable Lalabalavu especially multilateral banks that are triple A-rated 
<br/>by an international credit rating agency.  Any restructuring of any sort would result in lower credit rating 
<br/>for them, for the multilateral banks yet they continue to lend to us. Opposition so-called experts, can they 
<br/>explain this? They are all lying, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  These lenders do not listen to the critics here in Fiji 
<br/>because they are focused on the truth and do not care about the politics because they very well know what 
<br/>these Opposition  politicians  are saying is not  correct.   Fijians also should not  fall  for  these lies,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lalabalavu said, “Oh, they are lending to Sri Lanka now.”  Yes, that is different.  It 
<br/>is what you call a rescue package - rescue lending like they did in Greece.  It has come after governments 
<br/>have  been  toppled.  It  has  come  after  governments  changed,  a  lot  of  prescriptive  policies,  austerity 
<br/>measures.  They will tell them to raise their VAT.  They will tell them to cut back on expenditure.  They 
<br/>do it with all these prescriptions.  Everyone knows that.  They are not prescribing those to us, Sir.  They 
<br/></span><span>are not telling us to have these kinds of austerity measures that they put in Greece or in Sri Lanka.  See 
<br/></span><span>this is the kind of level of unsophisticated, non-nuanced analysis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, measuring debt sustainability is a technical and complex issue, so anyone that 
<br/>takes a simplistic approach and talks about nominal debt or dollar value of debt, for example $10 million, 
<br/>is trying to mislead or scare us for their own interest.  Simply saying that debt levels increased to $10 
<br/>billion without looking at other factors, holistically makes no sense.  Let us take an example.  Country A 
<br/>has a debt of US$88 billion and Country B has a debt of US$976 billion.  Country B in this case, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, which has $976 billion, has almost 11 times more debt than Country A.  Someone might 
<br/>tell you that Country B is too much in debt and if you just look at the normal value of debt, Country A is 
<br/>in a better position.  But it is not true.  Guess what, Country B is actually Australia.  Australia whose debt 
<br/>is highly sustainable and Country A is Sri Lanka.  But Sri Lanka is in trouble.  It has got lower debt value, 
<br/>only US$88 billion.  Australia is US$976 billion but we know that Australia is in a much better position.   
<br/>So again, this kind of rudimentary, basic kind of analysis, crass analysis does not make sense, just kind 
<br/>of grabbing onto something - $10 billion debt.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a classic example to show that the nominal debt level does not tell you 
<br/>much.  There is a classic case to show that the nominal debt levels do not tell you so much about debt 
<br/>sustainability.  Sustainability is what matters.  In the same way, if honourable Prasad borrows because he 
<br/>is asset rich and is cash rich too, he can repay his debt.  No problem.  He can borrow $2 million.  He can 
<br/>still repay his debt.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, beware, we have to tell members of the public that as soon as 
<br/>someone talks to you about nominal value of debt, he or she is not trying to scare you or probably do not 
<br/>understand about debt themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to suit their narrative, they have gone to another platform now.  The Opposition 
<br/>started quoting debt-per-capita, in other words, debt per person – divide the debt by the number of people 
<br/>in that country to compare debt levels across the economy.  In the same way, honourable Tikoduadua 
<br/>said, “Oh, the Prime Minister is not telling the truth by saying that the iTaukei youngsters who are actually 
<br/>millionaires because if you take the dollar in Trust, I think $54 million, divide by the number of young 
<br/>iTaukei people that means they do not.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  What  a  stupid  analysis!    What  so  obtuse  and  his  leader  is 
<br/></span><span>backing him up.  Everyone knows, Sir that a landowner in a tourism area in Nadi will get paid far more 
<br/></span><span>than probably a landowner in Lau.  You do not take an average.  A person in the Coral Coast will get far 
<br/>more for their land lease money than someone from the interior of Naitasiri.  So, obviously, there will be 
<br/>people within that $54 million parcel of money who would get more than others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are teenagers who have got $0.5 million and some of them have got, now they are only six 
<br/>years old.  By the time they reach 18 years, guess how much they will get?  However, of course, a young 
<br/>person who is in Lau where the land is not leased much, or in the interior of Naitasiri, or in the interior of 
<br/>somewhere else, will not have that much but the landowners where the land is high in demand, they will 
<br/>get more.  Make sense?  Landowning units, </span><span>i tokatoka</span><span>, they have small parcels of land, they will not get 
<br/>that much money.  It is just basic and honourable Professor Prasad is just howling on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This is the problem.  They latch on to a narrative and they just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not want to let go, in spite of the facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lalabalavu and honourable Professor Prasad, if Fiji is a debt-per-capita more than 
<br/></span><span>Sri Lanka, why did Sri Lanka fail - if they are going to use that analysis?  The debt-per-capita in Fiji is 
<br/></span><span>higher than Sri Lanka.  If that is the indicator, then why Sri Lanka failed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia has a debt-per-capita of US$41,000; New Zealand has a debt-per-capita of US$26,000; 
<br/>the  US  has  a  debt-per-capita  of  US$95,000  while  Japan’s  debt-per-capita  is  US$103,000.    Does  the 
<br/>Opposition mean by using this, honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu (this is the problem when you rely 
<br/>on those people), that these countries are worse off than Sri Lanka because their debt-per-capita is higher 
<br/>than Sri Lanka which has a debt-per-capita of around US$4,000 only?  So, if you are going to use that as 
<br/>an indicator as to how well you are doing, your theory is completely flawed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Checkmate! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have countries like Sudan that has a debt-
<br/>per-capita  of  US$1,900  and  PNG  with  US$1,500,  does  that  mean  that  those  countries  have  better 
<br/>situations than Australia, New Zealand and others?  That is absurd!  It is illogical.  It is stupid and obtuse.

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Professor Prasad, please, listen.  We hope you have

<div><span>talking about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has made statements outside Parliament 
<br/>too about debt-per-capita and now he wants to defend it.  He is saying it is one of the indicators, when he 
<br/>tried to say that that is the indicator.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most common way to compare debt levels 
<br/>across countries is to look at their debt-to-GDP ratio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Please, stop muttering! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is like comparing your debt to your income level.  Sir, GDP simply measures the total income 
<br/>of the country or the total value of goods and services produced in the country during the year.  Again, 
<br/>there is no magic number for the debt-to-GDP ratio to measure debt sustainability because even the debt-
<br/>to-GDP ratio does not give you the full picture about the debt portfolio.  It is largely useful to compare 
<br/>debt levels across countries relative to their respective GDP levels.  But, again, it does not say much about 
<br/>debt sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- You sound like a first-year economic student. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to talk in that manner because your side 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>does not understand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s debt-to-GDP ratio  is  on  a  declining 
<br/>trend since 2009 and reached around 43 percent pre-</span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  The large reconstruction spending 
<br/>after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> increased the debt-to-GDP ratio.  However, it is still below 50 percent of GDP, 
<br/>honourable Kuridrani. This is the same reconstruction effort that was acknowledged by honourable 
<br/>Radrodro. After the COVID-19 crisis, the increase in borrowings and large contraction in GDP has 
<br/>led to the debt-to-GDP ratio increasing over 80 percent.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1723 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kuridrani says that we have exceeded the benchmark 40 percent 
<br/>debt-to-GDP ratio. He conveniently forgets the pandemic and the debt levels across all countries have 
<br/>increased. Sir, 40 percent debt-to-GDP is not a realistic benchmark for all developing countries in a 
<br/>post-pandemic world.  Every single country in the world has increased debt post-COVID. This will 
<br/>eventually come down as the economy recovers, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, had we not borrowed during COVID-19 the economy would have collapsed. 
<br/>We would have had large devaluation which they do not acknowledge, social challenge would have 
<br/>increased and price levels  would have skyrocketed and our reputation  internationally would have 
<br/>been tarnished.  Through our decisive leadership and various hard measures, we have come out of 
<br/>the COVID-19 crisis successfully.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To really understand that, Sir, we have to look at various factors like:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the cost of debt; 
<br/>the ability to refinance debt when it falls due; 
<br/>the exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations; 
<br/>the availability of foreign exchange when an external debt has to be paid; 
<br/>the profile; 
<br/>the quantity of debt repayments of the upcoming years; 
<br/>the level of Government revenues to service the debt; 
<br/>the purpose of the debt, understanding who are the lenders and what are the lending terms 
<br/>and conditions; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>what is the state of the economy and the outlook; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>what are the consequences if Government decides not to borrow and many other factors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has to be a lot more nuance, a lot more sophisticated. We are sure the critics are not telling 
<br/>any of this to the public, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but the Government of course and our lenders watch this 
<br/>closely.  The fact is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has always been borrowing for capital 
<br/>expenditure  investments  which  will  generate  future  returns  to  repay  this  debt.  When  the  critics 
<br/>claimed that the future generations will pay the debt, they do not tell you that the future generations 
<br/>will  also  benefit  from  the  roads  we  are  building  today,  the  communities  we  are  connecting  to 
<br/>electricity  today,  the  schools  we  are  building  and  new  hospitals  we  are  building  today  and  other 
<br/>infrastructure that we are investing in and indeed planning for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  The  cost  of  debt  as  we  know,  Sir,  the  cost  of  building 
<br/>something today is far cheaper than building it 10 years down the track. The cost of debt has also 
<br/>significantly come down, Sir. We have borrowed over $900 million, more than 10 percent of our 
<br/>debt portfolio, Sir, is highly at concessional terms equating to over 60 percent grant element. They 
<br/>need to understand that.  The amount of money that we borrowed, we will only pay back 40 percent. 
<br/>They need to understand and grasp that. The World Bank and JICA have lent to Fiji at 40-year terms, 
<br/>10-year grace period and almost zero interest rates.   Grace period, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I 
<br/>need to spell this out for honourable Bulanauca, we do not have to make the principal repayments 
<br/>for  the  first  10  years.    Again,  this  $900  million  cannot  be  compared  to  $900  million  in  the  past, 
<br/>borrowed at over 7 percent to 10 percent at 10 or 15-year terms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2006,  the  SDL  Government  then  borrowed  over  $320  million  through  the  issuance  of 
<br/>global bond with the coupon of 6.875 percent.  Sir, $320 million, 6.875 percent with the entire $320 
<br/>million, to be paid in a lump sum after five years.  Imagine that! Paying interest rate of 6.875 percent 
<br/>and you have to pay the entire sum at the end of five years. This risk profile of the five-year bond

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was far riskier compared to the JICA debt we have borrowed with payments spread over 40 years 
<br/>and  interest  cost  at  0.01  percent.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  ability  to  service  debt  has  increased 
<br/>significantly. We have over 10 times more revenue than what is needed to service the debt every 
<br/>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to know that we do not have to pay the entire debt in one year as 
<br/>repayment is spread over many years and we have more than enough revenues and over $3 billion in 
<br/>foreign exchange to meet the debt servicing cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, has never defaulted on debt.  We also  never default another current 
<br/>scenario. Anyone that may say that Fiji may default on the debt, of course, is lying. We need to tell 
<br/>members of the public, “please do not fall for these lies.” We never have and never will default debt. 
<br/>They said China will take over Kadavu if we do not pay the debt.  Kadavu is still with Fiji and China 
<br/>is still where it is. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, we want people to rely on the facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  I  want  to  make  also  is  about  FNPF  and  Fiji  Airways.  
<br/>Honourable Jale, who made this very vociferous statement on FNPF and I will need to get the facts 
<br/>here. Honourable Jale was part of the Board in FNPF when they made many investments without 
<br/></span><span>going to members of the public, without going to the workers.  There was a handful of people, they 
<br/></span><span>had what they used to call in  those days “Employee/Employer  and  Government  representatives”. 
<br/>They actually engaged in Natadola and Matapo.  They had one of the people  from Matapo, Gary 
<br/>Erwin who actually ended up in prison. We had an undischarged bankrupt from Europe whose name 
<br/>is Gerard Saliot, he was declared bankrupt.  He had five pending bench warrants issued against him, 
<br/>yet they engaged with him.  He used to be flown in a helicopter from Nadi Airport to Natadola - red 
<br/>carpet treatment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these was done, money was going down the gurgler, no consultations and here we have, 
<br/>Sir, an investment in a Fijian company and any person who understands investment would know that 
<br/>if you have a viable company that may then come down because of things outside its control and the 
<br/>share price may drop and if you  buy the shares at a time where the share price have dropped, knowing 
<br/>full well that the share price will increase very soon because business is back and booming, you will 
<br/>get a huge windfall.  They do not tell us that, they are going on employer/employee representatives. 
<br/>In fact, after 2007, we had (because the law was such then) people like Felix Anthony and Daniel 
<br/>Urai who were board members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, we did.  So what, we admit!  We did because the law 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at that point in time was the same as it was prior to 2007. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Shoosh!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1725 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The law was such where you had to have two representatives 
<br/>from  Government,  two  from  employers  and  two  from  employees.  My  point  being,  these  two 
<br/>gentlemen picked up somewhere between $156,000 and $186,000 just in fees and allowances. They 
<br/>raked up telephone bills up to $3,000 to $4,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tikoduadua, who is now sitting on the other side knows this full well, honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad. He was part of the Prime Minister’s Office then; he knows that.  My point being 
<br/>and the reason why I am telling you this, Sir, is that just because you have employee representatives 
<br/>or employer representatives does not mean that there will  be good investments made.  It does not 
<br/>mean that there will be transparency in the way that they choose investments. I have got a whole list 
<br/>of companies that went under - Tropic Health and Bligh Water Shipping Limited which your new 
<br/>leader was part of, he was the CEO for a while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Jale, you may rekindle some of your memory here.  They bought 
<br/>land in  Nadi  without any  due diligence for supposedly a hotel.  The land is  there, I do not  know 
<br/>whether they have sold it or not.  All of these things were done, Sir, without any proper due diligence.  
<br/>Now, all in the name of, “we had an employee representative, we had an employer representative.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the institution with the largest cash reserves.  You need people on the 
<br/></span><span>board who know how to make investments.  You need a management team that can carry out due 
<br/>diligence,  you  need  an  Investment  Committee  that  have  the  acumen  and  the  skillsets,  investment 
<br/>knowledge, know-how and experience to be able to scrutinise anyone that wants to come and make 
<br/>an investment or use the FNPF fund.  That is what matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got the rate of return on investments.  Even in the pandemic, Sir, 
<br/>2020,  2021  and  2022,  the  rate  of  return  on  the  shares  was  5  percent  and  6  percent,  despite  the 
<br/>pandemic, despite the fact that we had a slowing down of global economy and despite the fact that 
<br/>the domestic slowdown of the economy. They say we use it as a cash cow; what utter nonsense!  The 
<br/>Ratu  Mara  Government  borrowed  money  from  FNPF,  the  Rabuka  Government  borrowed  money 
<br/>from FNPF and the Qarase Government borrowed money from FNPF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the level of obtuseness demonstrated by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>NFP.  In this period when the global economy has slowed down, when businesses have shut down 
<br/>locally, where would FNPF get that high level rate of return other than in government bonds? Where 
<br/>else would they have invested?  He cannot tell you that, he does not know that. In the same way they 
<br/>cannot tell us what would they have done in 2020-2021 from an economic budget perspective?  They 
<br/></span><span>do not know that, all they know, “oh, he shouldn’t have done that.”  They do not know the alternative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can tell you many people prior to 2007

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, you have a proper law in place that has that high level of scrutiny.  It has to go through 
<br/>various stages of scrutiny, investment committees done by the management. In this Fiji Airways sale, 
<br/>they had something like 32 advisors at one point in time to help them make the right decision. They 
<br/>engaged people from overseas who were experts in the aviation sector.  That is what happened, Sir, 
<br/>and that is what needs to happen.  In the days prior to 2017, it did not to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to also now continue with the rest.  The AFL/Fiji Airways deal 
<br/>that they were going on about. Many countries in the world, Sir, have their airports managed by their 
<br/>national carrier because the main throughput of that airport is done by the national carrier. It makes 
<br/>a lot of sense, it creates synergy and a seamless travel experience for those people who come into the 
<br/>country. They went into all these conjecture, no one is going to lose their job but as I told the media 
<br/>yesterday,  Sir,  it  does  not  mean  that  everything  is  hunky  dory  all  the  time.  We  had  some  senior 
<br/>management person in AFL who was caught smuggling alcohol.  People who came to the airport, 
<br/>friends, families, people who they knew, they brought them along to the duty free, pushed their way 
<br/>through  because  the  senior  management  said,  “let  this  person  take  five  bottles  of  whiskey”  or 
<br/>whatever  it  was;  charged  by  FRCS,  fired  by  AFL.  So  please,  you  need  to  understand  what  is 
<br/>happening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The management of that is nothing peculiar, there is nothing sinister, AFL is still a limited 
<br/></span><span>liability company, it still has its Board.  It does not mean there is a lack of confidence.  It is actually 
<br/>providing  the  synergy  that  is  required  and  most  airports  do,  do  that,  Sir.  We  do  not  want 
<br/>disconnectivity. Someone said, “It is liking guarding Dracula.  Honourable Professor Prasad said, 
<br/>Dracula guarding the blood bank. What blood bank? What Dracula? I do not know how many movies 
<br/>this man watches.  What is the name of the guy? Christopher Lee is no more, Sir, Christopher Lee is 
<br/>gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot have disconnectivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need these two companies to be in a 
<br/></span><span>lockstep, working together to ensure every airline, every visitor, returning Fijian, freight shipper and 
<br/>inter-island  travellers  see  the  very  best  for  our  country  represented  at  our  airports.    One  of  the 
<br/>mandates we have is that Fiji Airways which also runs Fiji Link must improve the airports at Labasa, 
<br/>indeed, and must improve the airport at Taveuni and must improve the airport at Savusavu.  There is 
<br/>a real need to draw those synergies, in particular, those three main airports that feeds tourist, feeds 
<br/>people into that. The airport experience must be enhanced, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, will build 
<br/>their further collaboration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>None of them actually mentioned or were proud about the fact that Fiji Airways was going to 
<br/>commence direct flights to Vancouver.  There are so many Fijians who live in Vancouver.  There is 
<br/>another market source we can capture that people from the East side of Canada can also come to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Leawere (again unfortunately he is not here), like most on the 
<br/>other side just make flippant comments.  He said, “Oh we’ll let go of our sovereignty because of Fiji 
<br/>Ports Corporation Limited.”  We have highlighted that several times since the sale of FPCL that the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1727 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>asset base is  still  remaining with  the Sovereign State of Fiji.  We have created a company  called 
<br/>“Assets Fiji Limited” where all the real estate of FPCL has been transferred to Assets Fiji Limited.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FPCL and the shareholders are interested in providing the services, they do not 
<br/>really care who owns the assets.  They want to provide the service and make money from providing 
<br/>the services. They do not understand that.  You do not need to own the asset to make money.  You 
<br/>need to own the operations to be able to make money and they do not understand this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government,  as  a  result  of  that,  is  now  receiving  three  times  more  the 
<br/>dividends that it was receiving before the divestment.  The net profit after tax has consistently grown 
<br/>and  remains  stable  even  during  COVID-19  at  around  $22  million  plus.    The  FPCL  and  Ports’ 
<br/>operations  did  not  experience,  not  even  one  day  shut  down  during  the  pandemic  due  to  well-
<br/>established business continuity plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the subsidiary partners of Fiji Ports Terminal Limited continued better turnaround times, 
<br/>elimination of congestion fees because shipping companies are charged congestion fees at Fiji Ports 
<br/>before this divestment.  They no longer have that, no change in fees and charges to counter rising 
<br/>cost internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The statutory role of FPCL is still maintained through the Sea Ports Management Act and 
<br/></span><span>there has been no dilution of the role.  Fiji Ports continues to serve maritime trading through high 
<br/>standards to Fijian businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  honourable  Tikoduadua  said  the 
<br/>guaranteed sugar price is completely incorrect and shows that out of political desperation he and his 
<br/>political party have now resorted to blatant lies.  In fact, it is concerning that despite the clarifications 
<br/>from myself in presenting the Budget, the honourable Prime Minister, the Minister responsible for 
<br/>Sugar and other Members, NFP is still going around telling people that $85 per tonne guaranteed 
<br/>price will not be provided for.  It, of course, is  wrong, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We call on honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad to again publicly withdraw, and I know he is not going to do that, he has got too 
<br/>much of an ego, as he seems to have intentionally misled Parliament and confused the farmers and 
<br/>other stakeholders in desperation for political survival.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sufficient funds have been allocated to ensure the guaranteed cane price of $85 per tonne will 
<br/>continue, making the fourth consecutive year that farmers will get a guaranteed price of $85 a tonne.  
<br/>As we have said,  reduced budget  allocation does not  mean that we have removed the guaranteed 
<br/>price.  In fact, the increase in the domestic sugar price and upward trend in the global price of sugar 
<br/></span><span>has meant that the cost to the Government has been reduced.  Therefore, the $8 million allocated in 
<br/></span><span>the Budget is sufficient. Just like if honourable Rasova decides to bring agricultural produce from 
<br/>Kadavu and say, if he starts growing cassava, and we say to him, “We will give you $85, we will 
<br/>make sure that you always get $85 for a bag.”  You go to the market and you get $60, we will pay 
<br/>you the difference of $25.”  So we need to make a budgetary allocation for that.  But if tomorrow 
<br/>you go to the market and they start buying your cassava at $80 a bag, we only have to make a $5 
<br/>allocation  for  you.    So  in  other  words,  the  budgetary  allocation  will  be  less.    Honourable  Mere 
<br/>Naulumatua understands this.  Honourable Professor Prasad and honourable Tikoduadua to say this 
<br/>is actually completely misleading, they do not understand basic finance and basic maths.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, you see this is a whole conjecture, going to the public, “You will not 
<br/>get $85 a tonne”, I am going to say this come what may.”  I have always said this to honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad - size does not matter. The size of the budget allocation does not matter, it is the 
<br/>quality of it.  Of course, they have forgotten the fact that we have increased the budget allocation for 
<br/>fertiliser. As some of the earlier speakers from this side of Parliament have said that the fertiliser 
<br/>price is almost tripled - $80 to $90 a bag.  The sugarcane farmers are still paying $20.  Before the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pandemic  it  was  $45.65,  the  farmer  paid  $20  and  the  Government  paid  $25.65.    Now,  a  bag  of 
<br/>fertiliser is $85, maybe it will go up to $90.  Assuming it is at $80, the Government has to pay $60 a 
<br/>bag, the farmer will still pay $20.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increased allocation in the budget, someone said about too much assistance to the sugar cane 
<br/>industry.  We made a provision in the last budget Sir, that we said that 43 percent of cane farmers 
<br/>(honourable Professor Prasad and honourable Tikoduadua and this johnny-come-lately to the sugar 
<br/>cane industry, they do not understand this) in Fiji cut less than a hundred tonnes.  So assuming that I 
<br/>cut 50 tonnes of sugar, that means my gross income is $4,250 a year, take out my cartage, take out 
<br/>my fertilizer, my lease money, how much will I make in a year - $2,000, $3,000, $2,500 in one year 
<br/>but why do they continue to cut cane?  Because they will lose their lease if they stop planting cane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Tanya  Waqanika  spoke  about  landless  people,  she  did  not  mention  these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people, she only talked about the blackbirded community, she forgets very conveniently these people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have made an allocation in the Budget, we said those people who 
<br/>now want to get into other types of farming or want to go into any other type of lease, please come 
<br/>forward.  We  have  already  had  16  applications,  people  are  just  tiptoeing  now.    Out  of  that,  Sir, 
<br/></span><span>majority of them said, “We do not do sugarcane farming please give us a residential lease, that is all 
<br/></span><span>we want.”  They want a 99-year residential lease, please give that to us because we need our homes.If 
<br/>they  stop  planting  cane,  they  will  become  landless,  honourable  Waqanika,  they  will  end  up  as 
<br/>squatters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When honourable Nawaikula (no longer honourable) went with his friend before, Qarikau to 
<br/>Vanua  Levu,  50  percent  of  the  cane  production  finished.  Those  lands  are  now  unoccupied, 
<br/>landowners are not getting any money because of political reasons, gone into the bush, no alternative 
<br/>farming for them, they will all end up along the Suva-Nausori corridor.  They all want water now, 
<br/>getting illegal connections, pressure on the infrastructure in the Suva-Nausori corridor; they do not 
<br/>talk to you about that.  When they talk about water woes they do not talk about that, they do not talk 
<br/>about displacement of people whose leases were not renewed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Who said? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is a fact.  Some of them are building their homes on top 
<br/>of a sewer pipe, it is a fact.  You go to a soccer match, football match you see all the Labasa flags 
<br/>here - in Suva.  Why?  Because they are here.  Unfortunately, for the Suva fans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a fact. They have now come forward to us saying, “Please convert 
<br/>our leases to residential lease.”  We expect more to do so, more will come forward and in that way 
<br/>we will be able to rationalise the sugar cane industry.  There are some farmers who are doing well, 
<br/>some landowning units have gone into a thousand acre farming - honourable Lalabalavu should know 
<br/>this in Vanua Levu, honourable Bulitavu knows this exactly well. That is why he gave that speech, 
<br/>because he is actually working at the grassroots level, he is not working at the political level that 
<br/>these people are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  inflation  mitigation  versus  what  they  call  the  “freebies”.    If  I  could 
<br/>respond to the issue of unemployment assistance, inflation mitigation and social protection.  I find it 
<br/>really quite horrendous to listen to the Opposition calling them all freebies.  If we said, Sir, that every 
<br/>person in Fiji will get $180, irrespective of your income, then I would say it is freebie.  They call it 
<br/>the </span><span>saqamoli</span><span> budget.

<div><span>1729 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Qereqeretabua  limited  to  the  World  Bank  extreme  poverty  measurement  of 
<br/>$1.90, what she actually fails to forget is that $1.90 is for your survival.  It means you have no other 
<br/>source  of  income,  that  is  what  it  means  but  she  used  that  -  crass  not  sophisticated  in  analysis, 
<br/>completely pedestrian, US$1.90 she is only giving $1. These people already have a source of income, 
<br/>this is just assistance to them to meet the inflation cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What a fundamental issue, Sir. In fact, I feel embarrassed to 
<br/>actually stand up in Parliament to make these points.  I should be sitting down by now but I have to 
<br/>respond  to  them,  making  all  these  flippant  comments.  These  are  for  people  who  already  have  an 
<br/>income, say less than $50,000 you will get that income even social welfare recipients are getting a 
<br/>top-up on top of what they are already receiving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aftercare Fund, Government Pensioners - all of these people then 10 percent subsidy on the 
<br/>bus fares.  We are not saying to the bus company, “Hey, you reduce your bus fare by 10 percent.”  
<br/>We know they have to survive too.  We are not saying to EFL, “Hey, we are not going to increase 
<br/>your electricity rates”, we know they have to survive too, they need to have a good balance sheet so 
<br/></span><span>Government forks it out and pays on behalf of the citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Kuridrani,  again  he  said,  “Oh,  all  this  money  will  go  to  the 
<br/>businesses.”  </span><span>Areh! </span><span>The business is the one that runs the supermarket.  At the moment you are buying 
<br/>your floor from them so what is the big deal?  The big deal, Sir, is that these people will now have 
<br/>extra money to go and buy it.  So what is he saying - People do not go to shops.  He said, we should 
<br/>not have done this, we should have built infrastructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- See the point is this, Sir.  We are building infrastructure, we 
<br/>are building roads.  Your leader is saying, “Do not give money to FRA.”  Honourable Radrodro says, 
<br/>“Give money to FRA.”  We are building bridges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Clarification!  I did not say, “Do not give money to FRA”, I said, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Budget of $300 million a year to FRA, so please …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Withdraw, withdraw.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Can  you give him a  yellow card?  He is telling a lot of fibs, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I have not got a yellow card.  I have only got a blue

<div><span>card.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, honourable Gavoka says, “Reduce the budget to FRA.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He says, “Give more money to FRA.”  He says, “Build more jetties and roads.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can do both.  If you say to a family, Sir, “Look, we are not going to give 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you the one dollar … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- A Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Areh! </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter))  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  I  mentioned  “supporting”,  he  is  misleading.    I  said,  “Supporting 
<br/>infrastructure”.    I  mentioned  cold  storage  improvement,  some  roads,  hospitals  need  to  improve  - 
<br/>those are the mitigation factors in my view.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Do not give money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Do not give money where? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did not say, “Do not give money.”  Sir, I was saying that in my view that is a mitigating 
<br/>factor but giving cash to people does not mitigate inflation.  That was what I was saying, an example 
<br/>where a woman to come from Navosa, paying $70 to go to Koromumu Hospital.  If they provide that 
<br/>infrastructure, that is, improvement to the hospital at Navosa, that woman will only pay $10 or $5 to 
<br/>get to the hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- They do not know. They are not that credible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have made your Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  could  just  correct  honourable 
<br/>Kuridrani, he said that we should focus on those areas, I accept that he said that.  But what he was 
<br/>saying, “Do not give this money for inflation mitigation”.  Not every person was going to go down 
<br/>to Koromumu; we know that.  There are people living in Keiyasi who may not be sick, so what about 
<br/>them.  If the price of floor has gone up, if the price of soap has gone up and the price of sugar, tea, 
<br/>everything has gone up then we need to help them.  That is what you call “mitigation of inflation”.    
<br/>All other countries are doing it, even countries like Australia are doing it to help meet those costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The bridge will be built, the hospital will be built, those people will be covered, but in the 
<br/>meantime there is an immediate need that people need to have.  There are people with five children.  
<br/>If the person is earning $15,000 a year, they have got five children, suddenly the price of all these 
<br/>basic items have gone up because 21 items have gone up, they need some assistance.  We are giving 
<br/>to them now that is what they need.  They do not care about some bridge, they do not care about 
<br/>some hospitals and Fiji is not only made up of people in Keiyasi.  There are lots of other people all 
<br/>over Fiji that need assistance, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I said in the introduction of the Budget on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, a budget is about addressing your 
<br/>immediate needs.  It is also about planning for the future; you have to be able to do both.  There is 
<br/>an immediate need in respect of this unprecedented rise in the price of imported goods.  It is a well-
<br/>known fact everywhere in the world.  Read all the reports, prices are going up, price of wheat went 
<br/>up. </span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1731 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister highlighted the other day about the weekend where Turkey struck 
<br/>a  deal  with  Ukraine  and  Russia.    We  do  not  know  whether  wheat  will  come  down,  but  there  is  an 
<br/>anticipated reduction.  In the meantime, the price of wheat will go up, in fact, it is going to go up.  Still 
<br/>no access to wheat.  So, we are going to tell those families, “No, we are building a bridge, do not worry.  
<br/>In the meantime, you go fend for yourself.  Go and buy flour at a higher price, we do not care.”  That is 
<br/>what you are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the kind of what we call, honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad said the </span><span>Saqamoli</span><span> Budget. Honourable Qereqeretabua and honourable Tikoduadua may 
<br/>think  it  is  actually  quite  funny  but  it  is  actually  not.    It  is  a  typical  of  what  we  call  a  “five  penny 
<br/>contribution to a five percent party.” But that is the level of contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on top  of the $500 million, we  have provided unemployment  payment  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financial relief in the past three years, on top of zero-VAT. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are continuing with our social welfare payments.  We said to the market 
<br/></span><span>vendors, “You do not have to pay fees for another year.”  They actually appreciate that.  They do not have 
<br/></span><span>to fork out annually $200 or $300 as some market vendors do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but they all call it freebies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a lot of people applying for jobs.  When they apply for jobs, the employer wants a police 
<br/>clearance and it costs about $40.  We are paying that.  They want your birth certificate, we are paying 
<br/>that.  If you are a taxi driver or a bus driver or a carrier driver and your licence expires, we will pay for 
<br/>its renewal.  If you are applying for a fishing licence, we pay for the renewal of that.  Those are what we 
<br/>call “everyday expenses” that we are trying to meet.  They are small amounts, but they actually have a 
<br/>huge burden on the disposable income of individuals; very basic, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like all Fijians to know that the Opposition is actually saying that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should not give you any of these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What they are also saying is that, the 20 cents levy we reduce 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from fuel, we should not be giving you that also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That’s what they say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, by putting those 21 items on zero-VAT, from a revenue 
<br/>perspective, we have lost $165 million.  Everyone buys soap, everyone buys tea, because we know that 
<br/>those people who go and buy that at 9 percent, we would get $165 million.  But we have made a decision 
<br/>to forgo that revenue so that ordinary Fijians could benefit from it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We made a decision, Sir, to forgo the revenue that the Municipal Councils get, but we are actually 
<br/>going to supplement it for them. The revenue that we get from the 20 cents levy on fuel ($55 million), we 
<br/>have forgone that completely.  At least the Municipal Councils are getting paid, we are paying it for them 
<br/>on their behalf.  The LTA we are getting on their behalf, Births Deaths and Marriages we are getting on 
<br/>their behalf.  But those two major expenditures, we have forgone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  issue  that  was  raised,  honourable  Qereqeretabua  made  a  flippant 
<br/>comment on why six months.  I think I have already addressed that, Sir.  If you read most of the literature 
<br/>that  is  coming  out,  God  willing,  there  is  an  expectation  that  inflation  will  peak  in  six  months’  time.

<div><span>Essentially, when it peaks, it means after that it will come down.  Peak is always a peak, it will come 
<br/>down after the peak.  It is like climbing the Mount Everest, then you come down.  So that is why the six 
<br/>months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, God forbid, if the war extends, we do not know what is going to happen.  We may 
<br/>have another catastrophe globally, or inflation may come down sooner than that – we do not know.  That 
<br/>is why we need to do a review.  That is why a responsible Government will do a review of it.  In the same 
<br/>way, we review it after the pandemic struck us, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Qereqeretabu  said,  “Oh,  because  nothing  is  good  with  the 
<br/>Government, that is why they have to do this.”  It is not about Government being bad or good or not right 
<br/>or wrong, it is about what is going to happen economically and what is going to happen globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the other point that some of them did make, they said; “Oh, you cannot 
<br/>have 12 percent growth because the global growth rate is only 3 percent.”  That is the average global 
<br/>growth rate.  Some countries will have 15 percent growth, some will have 1 percent growth, some people 
<br/>will have 25 percent growth, then you average it out.  That is how it works, that is how you measure it.  
<br/>So, for them to logically say, “Just because the world growth rate will be 3 percent, we cannot have 12 
<br/></span><span>percent growth rate.”  We are starting off from a lower base – basic, again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned the taxation that honourable Gavoka referred to.  Of course, 
<br/>we have removed 10 percent ECAL and we have removed STT.  I think he wants to bring it back.  He 
<br/>wants to bring back stamp duties. So, we want to tell all businesses, all the people who actually got ease 
<br/>of doing business that SODELPA and I do not know who else will bring stamp duties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the problem with them, they only look at one figure.  This is probably the 
<br/>former FRCS officer who was giving him the advice but they do not look at the multiplier effect of not 
<br/>having stamp duties. This is the problem. They do not look at the multiplier effect, for example, of giving 
<br/>those kind of concessions on filmmaking. We have reduced it.  I do not know whether he acknowledges 
<br/>that in his speech or not, I kind of switched off.  We have reduced it, to make it a lot more amenable to 
<br/>our economic conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  he  talked  about  in  a  very  kind  of  ambiguous  manner.  He  said, 
<br/></span><span>lewenivanua,</span><span> will help the </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span> and I said at the end of it, who is that? Who is </span><span>lewenivanua?</span><span> Who 
<br/>do you mean? He said, “All people.” So, why could he not say all Fijians? Why did he call </span><span>lewenivanua?</span><span>
<br/>It is ambiguous. Again, they are subtly bringing in this ethnic thing into it. All of them are, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir. No matter how much you say, “Oh, please” that is what it is. In the same way that you defended, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Bulanauca. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific  Labour Mobility Scheme,  all Fijians are the beneficiaries of the 
<br/>Pacific Labour Scheme. All Fijians are beneficiaries of the Duavata Initiative that we have with New 
<br/>Zealand, not on an ethnic basis, honourable Waqanika. I was quite surprised by your kind of xenophobic 
<br/>comments that suddenly will all be reduced and become I do not know whatever she was saying and she 
<br/>went on about Indians. She actually lied she said she did not say “Indians” but actually she did. When we 
<br/>persisted only then she admitted it. In the same breath, earlier on in her speech she quoted from the </span><span>Bible</span><span>.  
<br/>I really cannot see how people can quote from the </span><span>Bible</span><span> or from any scripture but then lie in the process 
<br/>too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, she also insulted every single Fijian that has applied to go overseas under the 
<br/>Pacific Labour Scheme, has insulted every Fijian that is currently working there.  A few months ago, Sir, 
<br/>I was at Wagga Wagga. I had a town hall meeting with those Fijians who are working in Wagga Wagga, 
<br/>a lot of them are working in abattoirs.  The meeting, 90 percent of the discussion we had with them, they

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1733 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talked about how can they buy vehicles and send it over?  How can they invest in FNPF? How can they 
<br/>buy a home? Will they be eligible for the First Home Grant?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These people were thinking about investing back home.  They were asking, “Can you talk to the 
<br/>Australian Government because we could have been given three-year visa. We want to bring our wives 
<br/>or husbands.” Some of them were females also.  They wanted to bring family members. That was what 
<br/>they were discussing.  To say and rubbish that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a huge insult.  It goes to show a 
<br/>complete lack of understanding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, under the Pacific Labour Scheme, the Fijian Government does not select the people who will 
<br/>go  overseas.  The  Fijian  Government  provides  a  facilitating  role.  People  have  to  register  through  the 
<br/>National Employment Centre (NEC). The overseas recruiting employment agencies come to Fiji.  They 
<br/>look at the group of people they want and there is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an opportunity for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, through his initiative through the Ministry of Forestry, they 
<br/>are providing a lot of training now for a lot of young people in sawmilling, portable sawmilling, using 
<br/>chainsaws and nurseries.  There is a huge shortage of people to work in the forests in New Zealand 
<br/>because as you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of the forests in New Zealand are run by private companies. 
<br/></span><span>They are not owned by the State but private companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of them have been recruiting, in fact some of the people who were certified 
<br/>over  the  weekend  in  Nadi  they  have  already  got  jobs.  Some  of  them  have  been  given  three-month 
<br/>contract, six months contract, they go and come back, earn some money, some of them work in Fiji, some 
<br/>of them are talking about starting their own business. We are looking at outsourcing through NDMO, et 
<br/>cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For example, if there is a cyclone rather than using civil servants, we can outsource it to these 
<br/>people who live in that particular area, province and village we can hire them out. They know how to use 
<br/>chainsaws and we will pay them for that. That is the kind of expertise we are building. That is the kind of 
<br/>business  opportunities  we are creating.  They  get some  overseas experience  well  and  good. They  are 
<br/>building that cadre of people in Fiji, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it seems to me that whilst they talk about freedom, they are going to 
<br/>restrict freedom of movement.  Say if tomorrow, some Fijian wants to go and work overseas, some Fijian 
<br/>wants to go on a three-month visit or three years visit, they will say to them, “do not go” because we want 
<br/>you here.  That is their choice, we cannot force them.  These nurses who are being demanded overseas, 
<br/></span><span>we are going to say to them “do not go”; we cannot force them, this is a free country.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>this kind of lack of analysis, short term goal is quite worrying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I wanted to talk about is the University of the South Pacific (USP).  They talked 
<br/>about USP quite a lot.  Coincidently, I just wish to read a letter that I received whilst on the floor of 
<br/>Parliament on Monday and it is written to the Pro-Chancellor and Chair of Council, Dr. Hilda Cathy 
<br/>Heine,  University  of  the  South  Pacific  and  it  is  titled  “Re:  Whistleblowing  against  Director  HR  and 
<br/>Divisional HR”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Dear Madam, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been in USP for the past few years and I currently work in Divisional HR.  This 
<br/>is to bring to your attention on the actual abuse of office by Director of Human Resources 
<br/>USP.  Recently, few selected staff (only Indians) have been promoted on acting roles and 
<br/>these roles have very high salaries.  New positions have been created, such as HR Business 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1734 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Partner and Team Leaders with very high salaries.  Only selective names were chosen for 
<br/>these acting roles.  Why weren’t the other staff considered? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Staff  who  were  currently  on  acting  roles  do  not  have  enough  management  level 
<br/>experience and are given doubled the salary.  This is just an act of collusion and corrupt 
<br/>practice within Divisional HR. If HR is unethical, then how other staff outside of HR will be 
<br/>treated?  They are setting bad examples.  All other divisional staff are now talking about HR 
<br/>staff promotion, especially staff given acting appointments with no experience on higher role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some had only occupied HR Assistant and HR office rank up till now.  The Business 
<br/>Partner role  has  been  advertised just  for the  sake.   The positions would  be  automatically 
<br/>rewarded to internal staff on acting roles.  This is just the formality.  I will ensure this matter 
<br/>is escalated to higher authorities for an investigation on Director of HR. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, there have been fraud cases against USP VC and HR.  Again, this matter 
<br/>needs to be raised so there is fairness and transparency in the entire recruitment process.  The 
<br/>good  applications  from  within  the  HR  Division  USP  and  outside  applications  will  be 
<br/>discarded.  I work here and I know the  corrupt  process  has  been  used.    The  recruitment 
<br/></span><span>process is handled by Totivi Bokini Ratu, hence copying him as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of the day has been strict on the illegal recruitment process at USP 
<br/>and now it is again time to investigate.  If HR itself is not following the rules and regulations, 
<br/>how can you expect other staff at the university to follow the same? Very soon, other divisions 
<br/>and faculties will follow the same strategy.  Restructure, provide fancy job titles and increase 
<br/>staff salary without proper justification.  This is just illegal practise by HR Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been other capable staff within HR and how come acting positions were 
<br/>only given to selected staff, some with no experience.  They are all new positions. This is just 
<br/>a scam knowing that positions will directly be given to staff who are already on acting role.  
<br/>Advertising and conducting interviews are just the formality.  This is just so unfair practise 
<br/>where other staff within HR Division are affected.  This needs to be investigated.  Why are 
<br/>other staff within HR treated unfairly?  Why cannot promotion be based on merit? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been no other division or faculty pay rise due to change in job title restructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is just a scam by Director HR, soon his salary will be aligned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hoping for a positive and fair outcome”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is in line with the Whistle-blower policy and is copied, Director Assurance and Compliance USP, 
<br/>Prime  Minister’s  Office,  Totivi  Bokini  Ratu  and  Minister  for  Education.    Attorney  General’s  Office 
<br/>stamp 22.07.2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Leawere and his leader, honourable Gavoka did make a statement 
<br/>about a week ago saying (and I only know from the media) that they said if there is nothing to hide, why 
<br/>are they afraid of an investigation?  A few days later, I understand that honourable Gavoka has a change 
<br/>of heart now and wants us to give the grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1735 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Misleading Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said, “let us end the stalemate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but leave the running of the USP to the Council and pay up the dues.”  Correction, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It was a change of heart though.  You did say, “let us investigate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are they frightened of?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have continuously said this, the honourable Prime Ministe had said this, I 
<br/>understand he also informed the Samoan Prime Minister of this too, after she had dinner at honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad’s house.  It was on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> and is well known, it is okay with other people they were 
<br/>there. It is fine, you can have dinner wherever you like that is fine.  I understand all NFP were there and 
<br/>others of their supporters.  But Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Even Richard Naidu was there! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is really unbecoming of the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General.  He is reading an anonymous letter and he is naming and defaming people 
<br/>who cannot defend themselves here.  He is mentioning Totivi Bokini Ratu.  I get a lot of anonymous 
<br/>letters  about  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  about  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  about  what  is 
<br/>happening at FNU and what is happening in the Ministry of Education.  I can come and read all those 
<br/>letters here and name people and defame them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is really abuse of parliamentary time.  I mean, he should just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stick to the Budget instead of reading a letter and defaming people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- Absolute nonsense! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you know very well that the subject of USP has come 
<br/>up in this Parliament so often, it is almost a repetition, repetition, repetition and all that he is doing is 
<br/>answering to some of those.  Now, it is a whistle-blower who sent the letter and he read it openly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In the past you have not allowed to name people.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister is reading an anonymous letter - naming people and defaming them.  That is what he is doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have never made a ruling about that in the past.  Never! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have to make a ruling on it.  What you are 
<br/>saying, is that I could come with an anonymous letter, read it here in Parliament and name people. I get 
<br/>so many anonymous letters about so many people here on issues that were raised.  If we are going to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allow this standard in Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, then it is a free-for-all. That is what I am saying, I 
<br/>think you should tell the honourable Attorney-General to refrain from doing that.  That is all I am saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have made your point.  The honourable Attorney-
<br/>General  is  making  his  Right  of  Reply  and  he  has  the  right  to  bring  up  those  matters  that  have  been 
<br/>mentioned. He has got a right to read that if he wants to.  You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he does not have the right to defame the people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who cannot defend themselves here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, that point about the defending the right of people who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cannot defend themselves has been brought up in this Parliament so often by you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have stopped Members from making that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- By you and by others. Honourable Member, you made your point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, no names have been mentioned, except for Totivi Bokini-
<br/></span><span>Ratu.  That was the only name and the letter actually says if you will listen because I know he is caught 
<br/></span><span>up in this theatrics. The recruitment process is handled by Totivi Bokini Ratu, hence copying him as well, 
<br/>that is all.  It does not say he has done anything wrong.  No other names have been mentioned so who is 
<br/>being defamed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The problem is, unfortunately for honourable Professor Prasad, he is very personally linked to 
<br/>this whole issue of USP, we all know.  Not just being a former staff member of USP, but also his spouse 
<br/>is  working  at  USP  and  also  he  has  very  close  links  and  openly  known  with  the  Vice-Chancellor.  
<br/>Unfortunately, he is kind of a bit jaundiced in terms of his contribution regarding the contribution at USP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well I can say many things about you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not go there! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my spouse certainly does not work at USP, 
<br/>nor have I ever been a student of USP, so I do not have any links with USP.  I do not know what he is on 
<br/></span><span>about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you need to make a ruling.  This man is talking 
<br/>about my links with USP - of course I have links with USP, of course everyone has links with USP, of 
<br/>course he has links with people in Government.  His brother is the CEO of FBC and he is the Minister 
<br/>for Communications, I can say he has links.  This man goes beyond any political morality and is trying 
<br/>to make a case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He has gone on and on for almost two hours pontificating here 
<br/>and there and trying to respond to every little thing that has been said by the Opposition, and throws in 
<br/>things here and there to make his point.  This is abuse of parliamentary time and process. Absolute abuse 
<br/>by this man.

<br/>by that side of Parliament or this side of Parliament.  That is his privilege, and for this occasion we are 
<br/>talking about the Budget, he has got the right to do that and I do not deny him that right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, one thing we 
<br/>have learnt in the past eight years is that when honourable Professor Prasad starts really getting irked up 
<br/>and starts doing his theatrics, we know that we have hit a raw nerve - when he has been caught out or 
<br/>when there is something very close to him, that we have actually revealed the truth on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Talk about yourself, my friend! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-    He  raised  about  my  brother,  honourable  Bulanauca  and 
<br/>everyone has talked about my brother at FBC, but FBC is not the subject of investigation and FBC does 
<br/>not get the kind of grants that these people get.  That is the point of difference.  Please, stop trying to 
<br/>obfuscate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have made a very simple proposition.  The Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee of USP 
<br/>raised a number of anomalies, the Chancellor raised a number of anomalies and we said they need to be 
<br/>investigated independently by an independent body.  Please, tell us what is the truth and we will give the 
<br/>grant.  I was asked by I think the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> or someone outside, saying honourable Professor Prasad said 
<br/>there have been so many investigations and nothing has been revealed.  There has been no investigation 
<br/>whatsoever on the issues…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Five investigations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  No, there has been no investigation on the issue… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Done by your people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  There has been no investigation on the issues that have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>raised by the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Chancellor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot understand why they have this huge problem about it.  What are they 
<br/>afraid of?  Is there something they have to hide; nepotism, favouritism, people being appointed like that 
<br/>letter shows?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notwithstanding that, the Fijian Government continues to assist our USP students through TELS 
<br/>and scholarships.  It is an utter lie by the Opposition and other political parties outside that the future of 
<br/>the students will be bleak because the government is not paying the grant.  Yes, I would admit Sir, if we

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did not pay the TELS fees, if we did not give the Toppers Scholarship, if we said to students, “don’t go 
<br/>to USP” - we are not doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The students have a choice - they get a Toppers, they want to go TELS, they want to go to USP, 
<br/>no problem – go, that is your choice.  We will pay for it.  We have not stopped anyone.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the Government is paying the scholarships and provides loans to students to cover their studies at USP.  
<br/>Sir, $156 million has been paid by the Fijian Government to USP from TELS and National Toppers from 
<br/>2014 until now. No other member country contributes anywhere near to what the Fijian Government 
<br/>pays, none of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2014, we paid altogether $4.7 million, in 2015 - $10 million, 2016 - $7.1

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Not a “so what?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  he  is  saying  “so  what”.    Unfortunately,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Professor Prasad please, I am feeling embarrassed for you now.  Please, do not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are embarrassing the whole country by doing that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  I  said  I  felt  sorry  for  him  but  he  attacks  me  personally,  but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anyway.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Climate Change Act, we have gone over the alterations made to the Climate 
<br/>Change Act multiple times in Parliament and the revision being referred to by honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/>was in fact a change made in early 2020.  We have been through this also before.  The inclusion of the 
<br/>ban on deep sea mining which reflects this Government’s position on this issue was originally included 
<br/>due to its linkage to ocean protection.  It is in the original draft. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, through consultations, it was deemed to be a policy which is better linked to the Mining 
<br/>Act, Deep Sea Mining is not a climate change issue but it should be a condition in the Mining Act.  So, 
<br/>if you go to the Mining Act that is technically where it should rest, not under climate change.  Again this 
<br/>is very crass analysis, “oh, they took out deep sea mining from the Climate Change Act, let us go for it” 
<br/>but they do not understand that it should be in the Mining Act.  In the same way, we do not put mining 
<br/>over other things in here, that is under the Mining Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is an issue which is associated with environmental degradation and it is likely to play a role in 
<br/>exacerbating the stress on our marine environment.  That is why it has to be in the Mining Act. That is 
<br/>why, in the same way for example, the Mining Act will set out the parameters.  If you are going to, for 
<br/>example, do bauxite mining, how are you going to get rid of the spill that comes from it? How are you 
<br/>going to deal, for example, with the tailings - that is in the Mining Act, Environment Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate Change Act is to do, as the word suggests climate change.  It is not the Environment 
<br/>Management Act, not the Mining Act, it is the Climate Change Act.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the kind of

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1739 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>level of response I have to do because honourable Qereqeretabua and others have put all those things out 
<br/>there  without  thinking,  political  point-scoring  and  have  sort  of  gone  off,  very  whimsical  kinds  of 
<br/>statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 9 of the Climate Change Act introduces the requirement to design a 5-year 
<br/>carbon budget to achieve Fiji’s long term emission reduction target.  This section further establishes the 
<br/>process  of  the  development  of  a  5-year  carbon  budget  plan  to  plan  a  whole  of  economy  emissions 
<br/>reduction to achieve net zero by 2050 target.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  clearly  written  under  Section  9  of  the  law,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  Minister  with  the 
<br/>assistance of the National Climate Change Coordination Committee must determine a carbon budget for 
<br/>Fiji in respect of each of the following periods, honourable Qereqeretabua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2026 to 31st December, 2030; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2031 to 31st December, 2035; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2036 to 31st December, 2040; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2041 to 31st December, 2045; and 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2046 to 31st December, 2050.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua, please read the Act.  Do not get someone to tell you what is there or 
<br/>not there. The carbon budget under subsection 2(a) must be determined on or before 31st March, 2023.  
<br/>I hope Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua is here with us on 31st March, 2023.  Time and time 
<br/>again we find ourselves in the same position.  The Opposition unwillingly do not put the time to read the 
<br/>key pieces of national legislations but have the gall to poke holes in Government’s approach to critical 
<br/>issues of national wellbeing, when the answers to their questions are not only publicly available but also 
<br/>in this case, available in written law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Any sane minded person would know that operationalising a law as comprehensive as the Climate 
<br/>Change Act cannot be implemented overnight. The reforms it requires are extensive and we pledged not 
<br/>to fast-track implementation in a way that increases the burden on Government and indeed the private 
<br/>sector.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot engage in productive debate if the Opposition does no more than 
<br/>showing up and speaking out without actually thinking and doing their research. Their responsibility as 
<br/>the Opposition to ask questions that have a basis and as I have said continuously, please read, please 
<br/>research and please think. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  have  said  continuously,  there  has  been  no  alternative  budget  being 
<br/></span><span>presented.  They have not even told us what they would have done in 2020 nor have they said what they 
<br/></span><span>could have done positively or contributed to Fiji’s economy.  In fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not even 
<br/>seem to have a policy or strategy.  The political opponents outside are saying, “When they deliver the 
<br/>budget then we will reveal our manifesto”, honourable Tikoduadua said yesterday that “we will not cost 
<br/>our promises.”  He said, “We are not going to adhere to the law” in the same way they are not adhering 
<br/>to the advertisement law. That is what he said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The law is crooked, that is why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He said they are all stupid.  When other countries are already 
<br/>adopting these laws Sir, they do not want to be honest with members of the public.  They have this 
<br/>political culture of hoodwinking people.  They feel ashamed to tell the Fijians their real plans and perhaps 
<br/>that is the reason none of the parties have released their manifesto except I think Unity Party.  I think 
<br/>Unity is having a…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Unlike you before the election - unlike you, you released it the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>day before elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, you see he is getting really desperate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very desperate.  I love this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am telling you the truth but you are lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I think they  are having  a dispute in  Unity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Political Party about who claimed what slogan at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while FijiFirst introduced hundreds of policies, we have not seen any specifics 
<br/>from the Opposition apart from criticism.  Of course, honourable Professor Prasad as we know when he 
<br/></span><span>was asked for an alternative ran out of a radio interview in New Zealand.  Sir, the honourable Lalabalavu 
<br/></span><span>questioned the increased transparency efforts brought about by changes in the Financial Management 
<br/>Act.  Transparency is now mandatory for all parties including FijiFirst when campaigning.  It is applicable 
<br/>to us too.  Do you have a problem with that? We have to be just as revealing as you have to be revealing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition and other political parties are busy fighting on petty issues such as one party had 
<br/>copied or stolen the mission or motto of the other party. Can they successfully run a government?  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, honourable Lalabalavu called Vanua Levu campaigning.  Unfortunately for them, we were 
<br/>the first ones to actually turn up there to have those kind of consultations and mind you Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we started budget consultations back in 2016, it is not something new that we pulled out of a hat and in 
<br/>fact, they lamented honourable Lalabalavu how many politicians from the past have never been to that 
<br/>area, nor have they had that level of consultations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did talk about certain capital projects not being implemented in the past 
<br/>two or three years.  How can it be possible to deliver the implementation of those capital projects over 
<br/>other urgent and pressing priorities, of course, COVID-19 pandemic during these troubled times.  If we 
<br/>have capital projects that could be put on hold and we used that funding to address, for example, increase 
<br/>the  budget  for  health,  increase  the  budget  for  unemployment  benefit,  of  course,  we  will  do  that.    If 
<br/></span><span>something is not failing and not critically needed now, we will of course put that on hold. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there were certain electricity projects, we put it on hold because people needed money to be fed 
<br/>and we did that Sir, that is what we call prudent management.  They talk about, “oh, these projects were 
<br/>not  implemented.”    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Lalabalavu  talked  about  the  underutilisation  of 
<br/>expenditure even in 2019-2020.  We had COVID-19 in March 2020, Sir, and most projects stopped and 
<br/>most ministries other than the critical ministries stalled all operations which were not COVID-19 related;  
<br/>another bias just to suit their narrative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Viria Water Project  as  some people call it,  commonly the Rewa Water Project is  the 
<br/>largest ever infrastructure project in Fiji’s history, thus far at a cost of $270 million.  One project at 
<br/>$270 million, Sir, because of over 360,000 Fijians who reside in the Lami to Nausori corridor and 
<br/>demand approximately 174 million litres of water a day.  The production capacity at the moment, 
<br/>Sir, is only a 172 million litres of water, two million litres of water short.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1741 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the opening up of Viria, if you drive down the back road, past ACS, you 
<br/>will see there is  so much work happening seven days a week.   They  have already laid  nearly 19 
<br/>kilometres of pipes out of the 27 kilometres they are supposed to lay.  Already they have done work 
<br/>so fast.  Of course because of COVID-19, a lot of the engineers could not come.  It would be ready 
<br/>in May of next year, Sir, only a few months away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will resolve the water problem.  It will end water woes in the Lami to 
<br/>Nausori corridor by an  additional 14 million  litres of water.  At the moment  we are short of two 
<br/>million.  We will add 14 million litres of water.  That amount exceeds  the current demand by 38 
<br/>million litres.  What does that mean?  Honourable Kepa would be happy to know.  People living in 
<br/>Korovou or towards Korovou and other places in Nausori who currently do not have reticulated water 
<br/>systems, they can actually have tap water after that because we will have 38 million litres of more 
<br/>water a day.  These things obviously cannot be done overnight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, if COVID-19 had not happened, this would have been implemented by now.  They 
<br/>do not take that into consideration.  They just simply want to say, “No, they are not dealing with it.  
<br/>Water woes are there.”  They do not talk about the fact that infrastructure has been so old.  There was 
<br/>no rebuild programme. We are doing that.  As honourable Usamate said, it cannot be done overnight.  
<br/></span><span>Sir, $270 million of which $32 million we got from the Green Climate Fund as a grant.  Honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister goes overseas, talked about climate change, we go and talk to all these institutions, 
<br/>as a result of that we got a $32 million grant towards the $270 million project.  Unheard of, it is 
<br/>unprecedented actually, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Naulumatua talked about the housing sector, squatters, et 
<br/>cetera. We have projects. None of them mentioned the fact that in Fiji never before have we had what 
<br/>we call the “First Buyer Programme”.  We give a grant, Sir.  It is $30,000 for those people who earn 
<br/>less than $50,000 a year, you are building your first home.  When we announced this last year, we 
<br/>had it previously, we had it at $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 and last year we increased the sum.  Sir, 
<br/>within three months, the fund finished. It meant that dozens of Fijians were building new homes.  It 
<br/>meant dozens of Fijians were also buying new homes and then also those up to $100,000 can get 
<br/>access to the fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also announced in the Budget the social housing assistance, what used to be called the 
<br/>“one-third, two-thirds project”.  It is now Social Housing Assistance where we give up to $10,000.  
<br/>We will give the actual plan for free which is cyclone certified.  We will contribute that.  In that cost 
<br/>we  have  also  built  in  for  cartage  because  we  know  Lau,  Lomaiviti  and  Yasawa  need  access.    If 
<br/></span><span>someone wants to build a house in the village, it includes the cost of the cartage, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Good, thank you!  I wish you had said that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were four members from SODELPA who came to the budget consultations; honourable 
<br/>Bulanauca,  honourable  Leawere,  honourable  Rasova  and  honourable  Vosanibola.    We  have  been 
<br/>calling them for the past number of years, they do not turn up.  I think the first time they turned up, 
<br/>honourable Radrodro and a couple of others had turned up.  After that, no one turned up.  I actually 
<br/>thought because honourable Leawere gave this wonderful appreciation speech at the end of it all, I 
<br/>thought there would be some common sense that will come out of their delivery but it did not.  None 
<br/>of them!  Honourable Bulanauca, I kind of expected that.  None of them!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Read the </span><span>Hansard</span><span>.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appreciate some of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things that had been done but we suggested more areas to invest and expand into.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He also threw in terrorism and all that in between, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Do not lie!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned about how we gave housing numbers and all of that before the 2018 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have 42 sites for development leases.  Most of these land, where we 
<br/>have what we call “squatters”, where we have, for example, we go and pay the development lease to 
<br/>iTLTB.    So  those  squatters  under  </span><span>vakavanua</span><span>  arrangement,  where  they  may  be  paying  the  local 
<br/>landowner or just one individual $30 or $50 a month or sometimes when there is a </span><span>magiti</span><span>, they come 
<br/>and  demand  more  money  that  has  all  stopped  now.  We  now  pay  that  development  lease  money 
<br/>directly to iTLB, who then gives it to the landowners.  So, those people living in those 42 areas, again 
<br/></span><span>they did not mention that, they no longer are paying any money.  What we have said, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, is that, we will develop these as subdivisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Waqanika had a go at us regarding the new laws we had put in place.  There are 
<br/>certain squatter areas, Sir, and as we all know, squatters do not build their homes in alignment with 
<br/>the road.  In fact, there is no road in most of those places.  Some people build houses right next to 
<br/>each other where they can actually hear each other snoring.  There is not enough space between the 
<br/>houses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we are to do a proper subdivision, Sir, where we have got the development lease and we 
<br/>are paying the lease, if they want roads, streetlights, footpaths and a 99-year lease and some of them 
<br/>will be subsidised with low-income people, they need to align their homes with the subdivision plan.  
<br/>How can we build a road between two homes if you can hear the other person snoring?  Where will 
<br/>the road go? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had a number of these projects put on hold because most of them 
<br/>may be in agreement but there are five of them, “I am not going to move my home, come what may.  
<br/>I am not going to allow for the drainage.”  We are paying for the lease, we have got the development 
<br/></span><span>lease.  One has been held up for the past five years.  Why?  Because three or four people did not want 
<br/></span><span>to move their homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have said in this law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that if she bothered to read it rather than try 
<br/>to score political points and going on about freedom, et cetera, we have said that if we have got a 
<br/>development lease and we are going to subdivide the land, you have to move your house to another 
<br/>area so we can build the road, put the drain, put the footpath, put the streetlights so buses can come 
<br/>and run there.  You can drive your cars there too.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  They 
<br/>are not being displaced, they are simply being told to move to another area.  If they do not comply, 
<br/>they have to comply, we will move it for them.  Otherwise, we will be languishing for the next 20 
<br/>years to  30  years.    It  is  a practical  solution,  yet  they  go on about  this, pontificating  as if there is 
<br/>something drastically wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  same  way,  honourable  Waqanika  said,  “You  are  following  Rabuka.    He  said  to 
<br/>nationalise land”, and she used the Surfing Act. What a stupid load of nonsense!  Does she know that 
<br/>Cloudbreak which is a surfing area near Tavarua was licensed by the Rabuka Government or post-
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1743 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1987 by one of the governments?  Tavarua Resort was given a 20-year licence over the surfing area.  
<br/>An individual foreign company was given a licence.  Honourable Ratu Naiqama  Lalabalavu may 
<br/>know about this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what did that mean?  It meant  that people from Nabila and other places 
<br/>could not even go there themselves.  You could only go once a month on a Sunday or Saturday and 
<br/>other Fijians who wanted to surf could only go on that “once a month”.  Tourists from other resorts 
<br/>could only go there once a month.  Only if you stayed at Tavarua could you go and use Cloudbreak 
<br/>– exclusively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cloudbreak is one of the best surfing waves in the world. There are apparently only two places 
<br/>in the world like that.  People come from far and wide.  So at the behest of the Fijian Government 
<br/>and the Fijian people, you had one company that made zillions of dollars because the Government 
<br/>gave them a 20-year licence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the Nadroga/Navosa Provincial Council Meeting when I went with the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and other Ministers, one of the villagers (I forgot his name, I wrote his name somewhere) 
<br/>said to me, “Thank you very much for this Act because now I have a thriving business because when 
<br/></span><span>tourists come, I have an outboard engine, I take them and I charge them lots of money.  I am making 
<br/></span><span>money from taking people to the surfing area.”  He does not have to go and get a licence.  No one 
<br/>from Tavarua or some other company stops him, and he is a member of that  </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> area.  He is 
<br/>making money, he has got his business.  What is wrong with that?  And she here is saying that we 
<br/>have nationalised it.  What stupidity!  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, she was pontificating, she is going on 
<br/>this ethnic line.  That is basically what it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wish to make is that the Budget does not in any 
<br/>way  address  the  issue  of  NCDs,  that  we  do  not  have  a  holistic  Budget  to  address  issues  such  as 
<br/>substance abuse, NCDs and other issues.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Budget, I did not say it 
<br/>in my speech because they would have said I am giving a long speech, it could have been a four-hour 
<br/>speech then.  But if they read the Budget Estimates, in the 2022-2023 Budget, Sir, the Ministry of 
<br/>Health has been allocated $5.4 million in funding which is an increase of $2.2 million that covers 29 
<br/>Public Health Programmes such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communicable and Non-Communicable Disease Prevention and Control; 
<br/> HIV Aids Prevention Control Programmes 
<br/> Fiji Suicide Prevention Programme; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Mental Health Awareness; and 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Polythene Bowls among other Programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Jale said, “We have deserted all our foreign relationships. The 
<br/>people  are  looking  down  on  us”.    Again,  what  a  preposterous  statement.  Does  he  know  what  is 
<br/>happening? Maybe he just irked about the fact that he was not given an invitation. But the fact of the 
<br/>matter is, Sir, is that Fiji’s international presence has been far greater at this point in time than any 
<br/>other point in time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji,  our honourable  Prime Minister is looked upon by many other countries  in  the world, 
<br/></span><span>regional players who look upon his leadership to be able to quell regional issues and he provided that 
<br/>leadership. A lot of that has been done privately. A lot of that has been done behind doors but we 
<br/>achieved the outcome.  For the first time in Fijian history, Fiji got invited to G20. They do not take 
<br/>all of these into account. They are caught in a timewarp.

<br/>trying to cover up for the fact that her leader said, “give them a 10 percent pay cut during COVID.”  
<br/>The fact is that we have also recognised and as highlighted by the honourable Minister for Health 
<br/>and others that those scarce skillset midwifery will get allowances, waiting allowances, allied health 
<br/>workers will also  get paid  overtime even though they are in a different  Band.  All  of that  will be 
<br/>adjusted. The teachers are getting that increased salary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of that is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Bulanauca said, “Why is this increased budget for RFMF? Is Fiji going to be 
<br/>invaded?” Again such a superfluous comment.  As the honourable Minister highlighted, he said in 
<br/>the Budget Address also that the reason why SEG 1 has increased is because of the fact the allowances 
<br/>that need to be pegged to the salary was caught in the 2013 allowance. So, we are just bringing that 
<br/>into alignment.  Someone was questioning, I do not know whether it was honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/>or honourable Waqanika the timing of it.  They did not question the fact that MSAF has also been 
<br/>given an increment. We wanted to do this during COVID, Sir, but of course we could not do it in 
<br/>COVID, you do not understand.  In 2020 and 2021 we could not do it, now when we have got the 
<br/>fiscal  space, we are doing that. Same thing  is  done with  MSAF. We announced it in  the Budget. 
<br/>There are some key qualified people who are leaving because the salary structure at MSAF. We have 
<br/></span><span>increased that so we can retain them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a couple of last points that I would also like to make.  Honourable Tuisawau 
<br/>went on about Act No. 22 of 2021 which was commonly referred to as Bill 17. It is no longer a Bill, 
<br/>it is an Act of Parliament, no consultation and again before the enactment of Act No. 22 of 2021, in 
<br/>order to lease iTaukei land there were five things you had to comply with: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>60 percent of the members of the landowning unit whether it is a </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or </span><span>tokatoka,</span><span> 60 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent of them have to agree to lease the land; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Agree for what purpose they lease the land for; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Agree for how long they will lease it for; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Agree for what will be the premium paid, in other words you value the lease and then whether 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they agree with the premium;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Agree with the annual lease payments made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those five things Mr. Speaker, Sir, existed prior to Act 22 of 2021.  Those five things after 
<br/>Act 22 of 2021 have not changed at all - still there.  The consent of the landowners for those things 
<br/>were required before the law, after the law; not changed.  Honourable Tikoduadua went on about it, 
<br/></span><span>all these other people because they thought this is political capital for us.  We can now go and tell 
<br/></span><span>the iTaukei people that your rights have been taken away.  It was not affected at all.  They all jumped 
<br/>on the band wagon, still harping on about it hoping they might get them some votes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only thing that has changed Sir, is the administrative arrangement with iTLTB.  The same 
<br/>thing Sir, applied to State land.  When you acquired State land or lease to get electricity, water or 
<br/>mortgage, you have to get a consent of the Director for Lands all the time.  Same thing with iTLTB; 
<br/>electricity, water, mortgage, iTLTB Management, not landowners, but management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have seen that so many people have given us feedback, so many landowners have given 
<br/>us feedback and this is great because now we are getting more people demanding for our land.  We 
<br/>can ask a higher premium, it is as simple as that. What is wrong with the iTaukei landowners getting 
<br/>a higher rate of return on their land?  What is wrong with that?  I ask that question continuously, what 
<br/>is their objective?  These are the same people, before 2014 they said you vote for this Constitution, 
<br/>you vote for Bainimarama, you live in reservations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1745 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Bulitavu  and  honourable  Nawaikula  did  videos  on  that,  we  know  that.    Then 
<br/>before 2018 they said, “Kadavu is being sold to China”, now before this Elections, they are going on 
<br/>about Bill 17; no traction. Since the 2013 Constitution, as they said Bainimarama becoming Prime 
<br/>Minister since Bill 17 or Act 22 of 2021; no rights have been affected of the iTaukei people - none 
<br/>whatsoever.  All of those three things have come to no fruition as far as their advocacy was concerned, 
<br/>none whatsoever.  No iTaukei people in Fiji today will say that their rights have been taken away or 
<br/>that someone is leasing their land without their consent – no one and that is a fact, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just lastly I wanted to make a point.  They went on about the voter turnout.  
<br/>The point is that the voter turnout of course, we do not have what we call “compulsory voting” in 
<br/>Fiji and we agree with everyone that says that voter turnout was low in 2018 compared to 2014; yes 
<br/>it was low.  We do not like it to be low. Of course, countries like USA, voter turnout is only in the 
<br/>50 percent.  Some other countries are much lower, we want it to be higher.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2014, it was about 86 or 87 percent, it is therefore the responsibility of every single political 
<br/>party to ensure that the voters turn up to vote.  It is therefore also the responsibility of every single 
<br/>political party to not castigate the electoral system.  On one hand, you castigate the electoral system, 
<br/>you castigate the institution that is running the elections and then you expect people to turn up to 
<br/></span><span>vote. You yourself are undermining the actual process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua and others when we say about how corruption is 
<br/>reduced in Fiji, this is Transparency International’s Report, it is citizen’s views and experiences of 
<br/>corruption.  They highlight, “Oh, the electoral system is corrupt, we are interfering.”  Sir, the reports 
<br/>by credible organisations say otherwise.  It says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We asked citizens in all countries about their personal experience with corruption 
<br/>in accessing basic services such as health care and education to better understand what 
<br/>happens  in  people’s  daily  lives.    We  found  that  bribery  and  the  use  of  personal 
<br/>connections are widespread in many parts of the region and across many key services. 
<br/>Which is the highest one:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Solomon Islands - 21 percent;  
<br/>Vanuatu - 21 percent;  
<br/>New Caledonia - 31 percent (actually higher than those above);  
<br/>Tonga - 38 percent;  
<br/>Samoa - 17 percent; and 
<br/></span><span>Fiji - 5 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again looking beyond bribery, the misuse of personal connections, NFP is 
<br/>always going on about personal connections.  Bribery is not the only form of corruption that people 
<br/>can experience when interacting with public services, relying on personal connections is a form of 
<br/>favouritism that can introduce systemic biases in how public services operate and which groups are 
<br/>able to use them:

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not published by the Fijian Government, this is actually published by 
<br/>Transparency International which is actually a leading organisation in the world that assesses.  Then 
<br/>we have studies here, sextortion rates (you know what that means), honourable Professor Prasad:

<br/>Samoa (less than us by one) - 10 percent; 
<br/>Tonga - 5 percent; and 
<br/>Pacific average - 38 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to highlight this because I remember when presenting the Budget 
<br/></span><span>when I talked about how corruption is reduced in Fiji, honourable Qereqeretabua made a very sniding 
<br/></span><span>laugh about it.  Sir, here we have vote buying rates by country:

<br/>French Polynesia - 23 percent;  
<br/>Samoa - 11 percent; 
<br/>New Caledonia - 6 percent; 
<br/>Fiji - 4 percent; 
<br/>Tonga - 3 percent; and 
<br/>Pacific average - 26 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is on the flip side.  It says: “Taking action. Ordinary people can make 
<br/>a difference in the fight against corruption.”  That is how they feel. Solomon Islands - 84 percent: 
<br/>believe that they can make a difference, Fijians - 83 percent feel that they can make a difference, and 
<br/>the others, of course, are lower than us.  Sir, that is the summary of all the ones that I wanted to say, 
<br/>the others are quite long.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one that I also wanted to make, honourable Kuridrani and various others talked about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this. They talked about other countries’ debt to GDP ratio and if I can read this out: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Country 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New Zealand 
<br/></span><span>Australia

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>96 
<br/>80 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is now put into context, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The last point I want to make also and I have got that 
<br/>nominal value of the debt. The other day, I think honourable Lalabalavu or one of them compared us 
<br/>but  when  you  actually  measure  debt  internationally,  you  measure  it  in  US  dollars;  that  is  what  
<br/>everyone does.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism-dependent  countries;  nominal  debt  value  if  you  came  to  the  presentation  which 
<br/>honourable Rasova, honourable Vosanibola, honourable Leawere and honourable Bulanauca came 
<br/>to, Bahamas’ debt level is US$11.4 billion, Mauritius - US$11.2 billion, Barbados - US$6.6 billion, 
<br/>Maldives - US$6.3 billion, Fiji - US$3.7 billion and then we have, of course, Saint Lucia - US$1.7 
<br/>billion and Seychelles - US$1.1 billion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the larger countries, and this is US dollars again but trillions 
<br/>of dollars, not billion, trillions.  Sir, US is the most debt-ridden country in the world, $30.5 trillion is 
<br/>their nominal debt value; Japan - $13 trillion, People’s Republic of China US$12.8 trillion; UK$3 
<br/>trillion; India $2.8 trillion and Australia $976.7 billion.   Sir, I just wanted to put that into context and 
<br/>highlight that to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  you  very  much  for  your  indulgence.  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the 
<br/>honourable Members for their contributions and more importantly, to all those Fijians, like I said in 
<br/>the beginning, who contributed to this consultations.  We have spoken to hundreds, if not thousands 
<br/>of people regarding this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, as we have said, is about addressing some immediate issues like inflation and it 
<br/>is  also  about  putting  in  place  various  processes  for  long-term  planning.  We  have  invested,  for 
<br/>example, into the ICT infrastructure, the honourable Professor Prasad made a mockery of our BPO 
<br/>sector saying, “We gave them all these incentives, nothing has happened, very slow”, it is happening.  
<br/>You do not just because you offer an incentive this year, suddenly people will start coming in.  You 
<br/>need to look at other incentives.  You need to be able to make sure that the communication sector is 
<br/>liberalised, you need to make sure the cost-structure is good, you need to make sure that, for example, 
<br/>as we have said in this Budget, we are putting a landing station in the Western Division.  We need to 
<br/>build redundancy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are currently talking to a submarine cable company to put another submarine cable to 
<br/></span><span>land  in  the  Western  Division,  just  in  case  God  forbid,  something  happens  to  the  Southern  Cross 
<br/></span><span>Cable.  All of these things are being done, but the BPO sector grew 3,000 jobs during the pandemic.  
<br/>They did not acknowledge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have said, the Budget is about the future, it is about the immediate 
<br/>needs, it is also putting in place the various strategic policies that we have in regards to that and we 
<br/>look forward to ensuring that we provide the stability and the level of consistency.  Some people talk 
<br/>about that it is time for change, the issue is - change to what?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If anything, the contribution by the Members of the Opposition inside Parliament and those 
<br/></span><span>outside is anything to go by, then it will be really stupid to make a change because this is the only 
<br/>side,  this  is  the  only  Government  and  this  is  the  only  political  party  that  can  provide  decisive 
<br/>leadership and that can provide strategic leadership.  It has the visions and in fact, we are, no matter 
<br/>how  much  honourable  Gavoka  will  laugh,  and  no  matter  how  much  of  a  mockery  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Professor Prasad wants to make, the fact is that FijiFirst Government provides stability, confidence
