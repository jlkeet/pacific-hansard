<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  I  welcome  you  all  to  tonight’s  sitting  for  the  delivery  of  the  National 
<br/></span><span>Budget  Address  by  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/></span><span>Communications, Housing and Community Development.  I also have the pleasure to welcome all those 
<br/>watching tonight’s live proceedings on television and the internet from the comfort of their homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  National  Budget  Address  and  the  subsequent  Budget  debates  are 
<br/>significant events in the parliamentary calendar.  The National Budget Address enables the Government 
<br/>to articulate and present its key objectives, policies and forecast for the next financial year.  In the same 
<br/>vein, tonight’s event is essential and vital for Parliament to fulfil its constitutional obligation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to advise all honourable Members that the Business Committee, in due 
<br/>consideration of the parliamentary convention and tradition, has unanimously approved to exempt the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy from the ordinary speaking time limitations for 
<br/>the delivery of the Budget Address tonight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  on  the  issue  of  the  vacant  seat  of  the  honourable  Ratu  Suliano 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Matanitobua, please, take note that I will address Parliament on this issue at the next Sitting.
