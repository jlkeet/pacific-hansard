<h3>2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  good  evening  to  you  and  everyone  else 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>listening in and, of course, the honourable Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaders from across the Pacific came to Fiji this past week and we are proud and honoured to 
<br/>host them in our capital.  We did not need to say it, but our message to the world is clear - Fiji, the hub of 
<br/>the Pacific is open - and we are laser-focused on a resilient recovery and future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the fourth National Budget that we have announced since the beginning of the pandemic.  
<br/>This Budget is different from the three before it because the worst economic crisis in our history is over, 
<br/>and our recovery is here.  We promised you in the darkest days of the crisis that our economy would not 
<br/>just recover, but it would emerge from the pandemic with pace and resilience.  Through Government’s 
<br/>foresight and decisive leadership, and with the tremendous support and participation of the Fijian people, 
<br/>we delivered on that promise.  This Budget is possible because of what we did together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The blueprint for our next financial year is as prudent, responsible and visionary as any we have 
<br/>announced.  It rests on the pillars of infrastructure, education and health, and is built by the values that 
<br/></span><span>our honourable Prime Minister has made his moral and political mission - family, security, justice, true 
<br/></span><span>democracy and equal opportunity.  This Budget creates the certainty that our businesses need to plan, 
<br/>invest and hire, and as prices for food, fuel, freight and fertilizer remain extremely unpredictable, this 
<br/>Budget provides relief for the families who need it most.   It is wholly the strength and speed of our 
<br/>economic recovery that makes all of these possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the many ways to assess an economy, the most important for working 
<br/>people are growth, jobs and wages.  That is as true for Fijians as it is for the citizens of the largest 
<br/>economies on earth and through the first half of 2022, Fiji is growing its economy - adding more jobs 
<br/>and raising wages faster than we have ever done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The economy is conservatively projected to grow by 12.4 percent this year; its highest rate of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>growth ever.  Some estimates put our growth projections much higher.  Employment numbers as at

<div><span>2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May 2022 indicate a total of more than 171,000 employed in the formal sector.  That means that 92 
<br/>percent of employees are back to work in the formal sector compared to pre-COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The demand for labour rose steadily to May, increasing by an astonishing 168.3 percent on 
<br/>the  year.    Increased vacancies were  advertised  across most sectors and the tourism sector led the 
<br/>surge, which is wonderful news.  We expect the June numbers to be even better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since January, we have welcomed 205,527 tourists as of June 2022 – almost 50 percent of 
<br/>the total for the same period in 2019.  Visitor arrivals for June 2022 stood at 62,130; this is almost 
<br/>73 percent of the June 2019 arrivals.  June visitor arrivals are the highest we have ever seen since 
<br/>COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australian  arrivals  in  June  2022  stood  at  almost  97  percent  of  June  2019.    New  Zealand 
<br/>arrivals in the month of June 2022 was 66 percent of June 2019 and US arrivals stood at 78 percent.  
<br/>July is looking very strong as well.  We expect to easily exceed our target of 500,000 tourists arrivals 
<br/>in 2022, which is 55 percent of pre-pandemic arrivals and that should mean more than $1.3 billion in 
<br/>total tourism earnings.  The boom, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is back, and it is what we call a </span><span>Bula </span><span>Boom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cumulative revenues collection as at 30th June, 2022 amounted to $1.96 billion, of which 
<br/></span><span>$1.5  billion  were  tax  revenues.    June  tax  collections  exceeded  the  forecast  by  $11.6  million,  as 
<br/>tourism recovery bounced back strongly, and most importantly, Sir, the wages paid to our people are 
<br/>up  by  $210  million  -  15  percent  higher  compared  to  the  same  six-month  period  last  year  -  $210 
<br/>million in the pockets of our taxi drivers, tourism employees, airport staff, factory workers, farmers 
<br/>and  families.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  every  dollar  of  this  is  owed  to  our  economy’s  once-in-a-century 
<br/>comeback from a once-in-a-century crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No society, Mr. Speaker, Sir, stumbles its way to record breaking growth or to these levels of 
<br/>wage increases and job numbers.  We consistently told the people of Fiji what it would take - nothing 
<br/>less than decisiveness and nothing short of solidarity.  Your Government led with decisiveness where 
<br/>it mattered most.  You, the people, supplied that solidarity and made our policies practically possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that anyone watching or listening needs a lecture on what 
<br/>was required of them personally to get us here.  The teams we led within Government worked far too 
<br/>hard for me to stand here and pretend any of it was easy.  I have spoken with far too many families 
<br/>and far too many communities to believe for one second that it was painless.  But if there had been a 
<br/>faster  or  surer  route  to  recovery,  our  honourable  Prime  Minister  would  have  taken  it  without 
<br/></span><span>hesitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The road we paved was the most direct possible out of the pandemic. We are proud of where 
<br/>it led and Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not the least bit surprised by it.  We thank our people for their 
<br/>patience, for their cooperation and for their faith in the promises that we made  because while our 
<br/>recovery was possible through the Government’s plan, its success depended on our people, on each 
<br/>of  you  watching  tonight.    It  depended  on  you  getting  both  jabs  of  the  vaccine,  plus  boosters.    It 
<br/>depended on  you staying home when that was  necessary.  It depended on your returning to work 
<br/>when that was possible, and its continued success depends on all of us keeping the country on the 
<br/>course that we have set.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in March of 2020, we clamped down hard on the first outbreak and brought 
<br/>ourselves a full year without the virus.  We then not only secured enough vaccines for our people 
<br/>ahead of most countries and at no cost, I might add, we deployed them at the speed of science and 
<br/>we mandated the full vaccination of job holders and recipients of </span><span> </span><span>unemployment assistance.  We 
<br/>kept paying social welfare and paid out $0.5 billion in Unemployment Assistance and indirect social 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1449 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support, more support than any other government has ever paid at any other time and we kept the 
<br/>bones of our economy strong enough to support our recovery so that when the borders open, our 
<br/>people’s jobs are ready and waiting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will explain how our actions achieved a recovery and how we 
<br/>will capitalise on the opportunity it brings because we believe we can do it even better.  That is the 
<br/>good news, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The bad news is that, even though wages are rising, so are prices due 
<br/>to challenges Fiji did not cause and cannot control.  Thanks to our recovery, Sir, right off the bat - 
<br/>this Budget builds more buffers to the price increases crises and long term, it commits us to the path 
<br/>that our honourable Prime Minister has promised will yield a stronger Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will announce our expenditures and provide a comprehensive update 
<br/>on  our  fiscal  strategy  coming  out  of  the  pandemic.    Then  because  it  is,  indeed,  our  most  urgent 
<br/>priority, we will review a package of imported inflation mitigation measures to defend our people 
<br/>from the record high prices of food.   We will detail new investments in infrastructure, such as roads, 
<br/>water  and  telecommunications.    We  will  lay  out  a  series  step  up  in  tertiary  education  support, 
<br/>highlight some of the important and innovative strategies to expand the rich and quality of healthcare 
<br/>and talk through some exciting new support to our farmers.  And we will end with a broad overview 
<br/></span><span>of important highlights from other Ministries and sectors, a suite of policies that will make business 
<br/></span><span>and investment easier than ever in Fiji, and an announcement of a low and sustained corporate tax 
<br/>regime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The policies and allocations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Budget are based on every conversation 
<br/>and  consultations  we  have  held  within  Government,  with  businesses,  with  communities  and  with 
<br/>families this  year and the years prior.  For the first time in our history, our Ministry of Economy 
<br/>travelled to what may be called the deep rural areas of Vanua Levu - to Loa Village and Tawake 
<br/>Village in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Tawake.  They showed us wonderful hospitality and more importantly, made 
<br/>productive contributions.  They are able to watch this announcement right now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>thanks to </span><span>Walesi.  </span><span>I would not have the time, Sir, to share each of the stories of those who joined our 
<br/>consultations, but know that all of you who participated in this process are the beating heart of this 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some ways this is two budgets in one.  Its immediate inflation mitigation package will be 
<br/>reviewed in December or early next  year in  consideration of the volatility of the global shocks it 
<br/>seeks to address.  But the bulk of this Budget is made up of long term policies that enable a sustained, 
<br/>assertive, consistent and wide-reaching recovery built over a multi-year period, and at the end of that 
<br/></span><span>timeline is  a resilient Fiji,  a greener and bluer  Fiji and a Fiji  that creates better jobs,  pays higher 
<br/></span><span>wages and gives every Fijian even greater confidence in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot base our entire plan around a fear of future shocks and 
<br/>crises, we have to see far beyond our noses, we have to harness confidence, we have to plan for the 
<br/>opportunity, the sort of opportunity that inspires our young people and our dynamic workforce so 
<br/>that  we  can  keep  Fijian  talent  here  in  Fiji  and  that  creates  solutions  that  we  might  have  thought 
<br/>impossible even a generation ago.  This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, does that.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the pandemic, Government literally became the economy, or the least 
<br/>majority of it, through stimulus packages that supported businesses and created activity everywhere 
<br/>we could.  We made the strategic decision to borrow $2 billion from credible financial institutions at 
<br/>extremely concessionary terms, which means rock-bottom interest rates.  Most of these loans have 
<br/>major grant components.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  effect,  Sir,  that  means  we  do  not  have  to  pay  back  more  than  half  of  the  amount  we 
<br/>borrowed, of course, we took it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Any government that turns down grant-funding 
<br/>that has no strings attached at no hidden costs and that will benefit its people should be sacked by 
<br/>those same people the very same day.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what we call common-sense.  We 
<br/>have  always  brought  that  same  common-sense,  responsible  and  disciplined  philosophy  to  our 
<br/>borrowing strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of 2006, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 53.5 percent. It rose to 56.2 
<br/>percent by 2010.  Then it entered a steady downward trajectory, falling to 43.5 percent in 2016-2017, 
<br/>a decline of almost 13 percentage points in six years.  Why did the debt-to-GDP ratio decline? The 
<br/>maths, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very simple.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our normal GDP rose much faster than our debt levels, rising from $5.3 
<br/>billion to $11.8 billion during the same period, notwithstanding </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and 13 other cyclones. 
<br/>Amidst all of these, as I have mentioned -  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and 13 cyclones that followed, the devastation 
<br/>we suffered required higher levels of borrowing to build back better. We had to pay now to build 
<br/>resilience in order to avoid much higher costs down the track.  The debt-to-GDP rose to 48.4 percent 
<br/>by 2018-2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was an injustice that Fiji had to borrow to rebuild from climate-driven disasters that we did 
<br/>not  cause, and that was a point we made relentlessly to  the world’s financial institutions.  I have 
<br/>explained the cost of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> hundreds of times to thousands of people.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of 
<br/>that advocacy worked.  The world heard us and we were able to access more affordable finance at 
<br/>lower interest rates.  From 2018 to 2020, the average cost of our overall debt portfolio began to fall 
<br/>from 6 percent in July 2019 to 5.6 percent in July 2020.  This trend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, made it obvious 
<br/>that the debt-to-GDP ratio alone was not the only measure that mattered, the cost of our debt mattered 
<br/>just as much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  COVID’s  economic  impact  was  worse  than  </span><span>TC  Winston,  TC  Yasa,  TC 
<br/>Harold</span><span> and every other storm that struck us since 2016, combined. Tax revenues fell by 50 percent 
<br/>on average every month. We lost almost $1.4 billion in tax revenue over 12 months.  So, in two years, 
<br/>we lost almost $2.8 billion in tax revenue.  During the same period, we had other new non-tax inflows, 
<br/>like Budget Support Grants and Divestment Receipts from EFL that partially mitigated this revenue 
<br/>decline.  So, we borrowed to maintain public expenditures at around $3.7 billion which includes the 
<br/>over $500 million provided in unemployment support and other relief measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The average cost of our overall debt portfolio as of July 2022 is 4.4 percent - a reduction, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>of almost  one-quarter from  pre-pandemic levels.   That  translates to, at  least,  $100 million annual 
<br/>savings on interest payments.  Interest payments alone, a savings of $100 million.  This was mainly 
<br/>due  to  Government’s  ability  to  negotiate  access  to  lower  cost  policy-based  loans,  concessional 
<br/>financing and lower domestic yields over the pandemic period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Certain politicians and their lackeys love talking about debt, but they refuse to talk about these 
<br/>falling servicing  costs.  They  refuse to  acknowledge the imperative of borrowing during a global 
<br/>crisis, and worst of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they refuse to talk about the alternative, let alone offer one. 
<br/>They refuse to tell the people what would have happened if the Government had not stepped up and 
<br/>kept  the  economy  going.  Their  deliberate  distortion  of  reality  is  worse  than  uninformed.  It  is 
<br/>dishonest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us tell you, oddly enough, I think the Fijian people do not need to 
<br/>hear it from me because they know it is the only Opposition Members who sit in this Chamber, their 
<br/>Party hacks and their various mouthpieces in the media and elsewhere who need to wake up and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1451 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>smell the coffee. The pandemic hit hard everywhere, but as the United Nations Secretary-General 
<br/>recently  said  only  few  days  ago  at  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  (PIF)  where  our  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister chaired the session and was the Chair of the Forum, small island economies were, by far the 
<br/>most, vulnerable. These vulnerabilities are inherent and unavoidable. They have to do with the size, 
<br/>scale and relative isolation of our countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, we cannot fix our place on the map, even if we wanted to.  Pre-COVID, the 
<br/>Fijian economy is coming out of nine straight  years of economic growth.  Agriculture production 
<br/>was at record highs, tourism was at record highs, manufacturing was at record highs and new sectors 
<br/>like business process outsourcing were gaining steam.  The pandemic caused our economy to shrink 
<br/>by 17.2 percent in 2020 which took our GDP back to 2015 levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  given  our  expected  rate  of  growth  following  the  resumption  of  tourism  last 
<br/>December, we should fully return to pre-COVID level of GDP by 2024.  Without the Government’s 
<br/>stimulus  package,  the  closure  of  our  borders  and  introduction  of  necessary  health  restrictions,  it 
<br/>would  have  created  a  socio-economic  crisis  and  inflicted  decades  long  of  economic  devastation.  
<br/>People would have been cast into abject poverty.  We would have depleted our foreign reserves.  We 
<br/>very well would have lost our national carrier and be left with no planes flying visitors to our shores.  
<br/></span><span>Hotels would be closed and sold off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, the only blooming business would be debt collectors and the best job available 
<br/>would be for people who board up shop windows.  We would see riots in the streets and that anger 
<br/>would be justified because people would have had no food to eat.  Rising prices, plus jobless people, 
<br/>plus shattered businesses would add to the worst socio-economic unrest in history.  Ten, even twenty 
<br/>years from now, we still would find ourselves recovering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We borrowed prudently to prevent that.  Every government on earth that could borrow did so 
<br/>for the same reason, and we did not just starve off disaster, we prepared actually for the future.  Any 
<br/>objective business owner understands that Government took on that debt so that they, the businesses, 
<br/>would not have to.  The private sector in Fiji holds a debt of $10 billion.  If Government had not 
<br/>borrowed money offshore and then injected that liquidity into our domestic financial system, private 
<br/>sector interest  rates would  have gone through the roof to  as high  as  10 percent.   That  means, we 
<br/>prevented debt servicing cost of businesses from skyrocketing by upwards of $1 billion which would 
<br/>have  made  serious  investment  virtually  impossible  for  years  to  come,  and  we  managed  that  well 
<br/>within the bounds of prudency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  height  of  the  pandemic,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  worked  closely  with 
<br/></span><span>financial institutions and the Reserve Bank of Fiji, to grant a moratorium on more than 30,000 private 
<br/>sector loans.  A total  of more than $3 billion is COVID-19 related. We thank the banks for their 
<br/>cooperation and support to our businesses.  It has certainly paid off.  Most of these loans are now 
<br/>being paid back - principal and interest.  Only a tiny sliver of these loans are not serviceable and at a 
<br/>negligible cost.  That means, businesses are not only open, they are doing well enough to make good 
<br/>on their loan payments.  We tie them over when it mattered most so  that businesses did not shut 
<br/>down, people did not lose homes and jobs did not disappear forever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While our opponents speak about debt, they ignore the robust economic activity that allows 
<br/>us to manage that debt.  These businesses are open, these homes have stayed with their families and 
<br/>our people are working.  That is what the Opposition did not tell us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, or the general 
<br/>public, that is what they refused to even admit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our private sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, did more than survive.  Businesses are seizing on their 
<br/>recovery, adding steams through multi-million dollar investments.  In the coming months, Sir, we

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expect  over  $1  billion  in  domestic-private  sector  investments  to  commence,  which  include 
<br/>investments from the challenged group - B.L. Naidu &amp; Sons Ltd; Vinod Patel &amp; Co. Ltd; New World 
<br/>Ltd (Fiji); Punja &amp; Sons Ltd; Carpenters; Lion One; EFL; Vodafone; BSP Life; FMF; TFL; Digicel; 
<br/>Sheraton; Pullman Hotels &amp; Resorts; Fiji Water; 18 Degrees Water; Vatulele Hotel Group; Grace 
<br/>Road Group; Rups Big Bear; Supreme Fuel; P. Meghji  Trading PTE Ltd; Damodar Brothers (Films) 
<br/>Ltd; Rups Big Bear; CJs Group; and McDonald’s, put together with other industry players, will be 
<br/>showing over $1 billion worth of confidence in our economy and, indeed, in our recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government also borrowed money so that workers being paid off from the tourism sector and 
<br/>the industry and other sectors could succeed at entrepreneurial ventures at opening small and medium 
<br/>businesses and other enterprises.  The results speak for themselves - hundreds of SMEs are open and 
<br/>thriving throughout the country, creating jobs and contributing to Fiji’s GDP every single day.  None 
<br/>of  these  would  have  been  possible  without  the  Government  working  throughout  the  pandemic  to 
<br/>strengthen the resilience of both our formal and informal sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Smart borrowing on our part made that happen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our opponents did not tell 
<br/>you that either.   Because of the extraordinary actions we took, domestic inflation is at 5.1 percent, 
<br/>while  globally  it  is  projected  to  exceed  7  percent.  The  Fijian  dollar,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  not 
<br/></span><span>devalued.  Imagined then what families were paying for bread with a decline in national currency.  
<br/></span><span>Foreign reserves hit a record high this week at $3.62 billion for 8.4 months’ worth of import </span><span>kava. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  represents  our  ability  to  purchase  and  import  goods  from  other 
<br/>countries. If these reserves were low, Fijians would not have access to essentials like fuel, cooking 
<br/>gas, clothing and every other import we rely on.  Liquidity is over $2 billion.  Domestic interest rates 
<br/>are at record lows.  An Economist from ANZ has predicted 23.2 percent growth this year, I hope he 
<br/>is  right,  and  Westpac  projects  12.9  percent,  both  higher  than  our  relatively  conservative  estimate 
<br/>which is about 12.4 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was our purpose-built pandemic response that built a foundation of this 
<br/>recovery.  But our greatest achievement is not what we delivered, it is what we prevented.  Many 
<br/>developed and developing nations are facing downward recession, Fiji actually is not.  Many nations 
<br/>are  facing  double  digit  inflation,  even  as  high  as  80  percent,  Fiji  is  in  the  single  digits.  Many 
<br/>currencies have been devalued, Fiji’s dollar has not been. Many countries are still closed to tourism 
<br/>at this very moment, Fiji is opened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many countries have vaccinated fewer than half of their eligible populations, the Fijian adult 
<br/></span><span>population is virtually all vaccinated.  Some people in other countries are waiting for days for fuel 
<br/></span><span>and cooking gas, Fijians are not.  Some people are literally starving to death, Fijians are not.  Open 
<br/>a newspaper and read what is happening around the world, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  See the images, listen 
<br/>to the stories and you will understand that billions of people would like to be in our shoes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to share an account what is happening right now in Sri Lanka.  A 
<br/>lady called Chamila Nilanthi, a 47 year old mother of two, spent three days lining up to get kerosene 
<br/>in the Sri Lankan town of Gampaha, North East of the capital of Colombo.  Two weeks earlier, she 
<br/>spent three days in a queue for cooking gas but came home with none and she says, “I am totally fed 
<br/>up and exhausted.  I do not know how long we have to do this.”  In China, there are protests over 
<br/>frozen bank accounts and people continue to  live under crushing of COVID-19 restrictions.  The 
<br/>largest street demonstrations ever are underway in Cuba right now due to severe food shortages and 
<br/>arduous COVID-19 restrictions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  suffering  is  actually  real.    It  is  heart-breaking  and  is  playing  out 
<br/>globally.  If we had bungled our pandemic response, Fijians would face the full brunt of this same

<div><span>headwinds.  Instead, we are recovering.  We can respond to protect our people and there is not an 
<br/>economy anywhere in the world, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would bet on more than ours in this particular 
<br/>moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We never stroke for short-term gains, we never treated elections as a yardstick for making 
<br/>economic  policy  announcements.  That  would  be  grossly  irresponsible  and  a  slap  to  the  face  of 
<br/>ordinary Fijians.  We put the economy and the long-term livelihoods of our peoples first.  We put the 
<br/>economic, financial and social security of Fiji and Fijians first.  Many in and outside of this Chamber 
<br/>will not admit any of this because they oppose the similar strategy that delivered it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They argued, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Government should let the economy fend for itself, cut 
<br/>spending, cut Civil Service salaries and ours, abandon our national carrier and leave Fijian businesses 
<br/>at the mercy of the market for loans.  If that was not enough, they wrote off our assistance as freebies.  
<br/>They then protested our vaccination policies and our borders reopening.  They planned, if you can 
<br/>call it a plan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should have set alarm bells ringing in every household.  Sir, if the 
<br/>Opposition had their way right now, Fiji would be worse than Sri Lanka.  Theirs was a recipe for an 
<br/>isolated country, a collapse in economy and a people in crisis.  But we did not listen, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, even on the most difficult days, we did not listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me correct them. We did listen initially but we stopped because we could 
<br/>not believe what we were hearing.  We could not believe the shallowness of their understanding, their 
<br/>inability to grasp basic economics and their apparent lack of concern for the people in Fiji, who work 
<br/>hard everyday to build a life for themselves and their families.  Thank God, Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one 
<br/>listened to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what has that taught us?  The Opposition and political opponents makes 
<br/>memes,  this  Government  makes  jobs.    The  Opposition  cares  about  their  jobs,  we  care  about  the 
<br/>people.    The  Opposition  raises  petty  political  objections,  we  actually  raise  wages.    We  serve  the 
<br/>people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by delivering historic economic victory after historic economic victory.  
<br/>The Opposition serve themselves, not so much out of a potent mix of incompetency and political 
<br/>power seeking, they are politicians before all else and the only jobs they care about are their own.  
<br/>Despite all of their dire doomsday warnings, the reality of the matter is that, if we turn to the global 
<br/>market  right  now  to  raise  funds,  credible  financial  institutions  would  still  lend  to  us  without 
<br/>hesitation.  We are not talking about unscrupulous loan sharks here and there, these institutions do 
<br/>not throw money around like the National Bank of Fiji did before it collapsed.  These are the most 
<br/>sophisticated multilateral and bilateral lenders in the history of human civilisation and they remain 
<br/></span><span>confident in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they may have seen that every dollar we borrowed, we used wisely - they 
<br/>have seen that.  We took a market system development lens to our recovery initiatives in order to 
<br/>empower the private sector.  Once again, we worked with bilateral and multilateral partners to begin 
<br/>building more resilient, flexible and efficient supply chains in industries via an extensive network of 
<br/>businesses, government agencies, apex bodies and research bodies.  That critical planning has meant, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we can now rely on a strong private sector to lead economic growth, while the 
<br/>Government ensures macroeconomic stability, economic confidence building and improving even 
<br/>further the ease of doing business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we had bowed down to political opponents demands to stop borrowing, 
<br/>the private sector would have not had any cheap finance to draw upon.  Businesses would be paying 
<br/>up to 15 percent interest rate in the current debts and majority of them would have been finished and 
<br/>no question.  That is what our political opponents consistently cannot seem to comprehend or worse, 
<br/>do not care to comprehend.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition are not  business  people.  They complained about  our 15 
<br/>years in Government, but a number of them have been in politics since the 1980s and 1990s.  The 
<br/>world has changed, and they have not, and if you cannot understand what business needs are in the 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span> century, you cannot run an economy and you cannot lead a modern country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the sake of honesty and fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope we can recognise how foolish it is 
<br/>to claim that Fiji is on par with nations  undergoing financial and humanitarian crisis.  Fiji is in a 
<br/>strong fiscal position post-pandemic than Sri Lanka’s before the pandemic, by a long margin.  That 
<br/>was exactly what Dumith Fernando, the former Chairman of the Colombo Stock Exchange said in 
<br/>Fiji, at a lecture earlier this month.  Frankly, to compare our situation to theirs is insulting, not to us 
<br/>in  Government,  but  to  those who are suffering  because it trivializes  what  they  are actually  going 
<br/>through now.  They have absolutely no compassion for that.  We did not let that happen, and we will 
<br/>not let it happen, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we saved most of our businesses from going under when it mattered 
<br/>most as we have promised, we now expect the private sector to step up and play a much bigger role 
<br/>in our recovery.  Apart from the over $1billion loan in upcoming domestic investments, we have also 
<br/>set the stage for massive foreign investment that will create development, jobs and income in the 
<br/></span><span>tourism, manufacturing, mining and BPO sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The latest findings show us that private sector credit is accelerating.  During the first five 
<br/>months of this year, over $1billion worth of loans have been disbursed to the private sector, which 
<br/>means the engine of business  led-growth is  tuned for high and rising performance.  Through this 
<br/>Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is only borrowing to fund capital expenditure, as we have 
<br/>restored the discipline fiscal balance that ensures we only borrow to build, not to cover operational 
<br/>expenditure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may remember that past Governments even without the catastrophe of 
<br/>a global pandemic, took on debt just to pay civil servants.  They did not need a global crisis like a 
<br/>pandemic to create a fiscal one for themselves.  Safe to say, they would have sunk to the bottom of 
<br/>Suva Harbour with the once in a hundred year event like COVID-19 on their shoulders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To meet the crisis with the powerful and necessary stimulus, this Government announced a 
<br/>20 percent deficit in 2020-2021, that fell to 16.2 percent in the current financial year.  Tonight, it falls 
<br/>to a manageable 7.4 percent through a budget that is as decisive for our recovery as is it disciplined.  And 
<br/>over the next two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be brought below 3.0 percent and bring our debt-to-GDP 
<br/></span><span>ratio below 70 percent within the next seven years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, true to our commitment to fiscal consolidation and fiscal responsibility, we are 
<br/>reducing our deficit level, as I have said, to 7.4 percent of GDP.  Our forecast of total revenue stands at 
<br/>$2.9 billion and our total expenditure at $3.8 billion, or net deficit of $872 million and debt-to-GDP 
<br/>projected to hit 85 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government’s role in the recovery moving forward is two-fold - one, we have to ensure that 
<br/>the private sector has the flexibility to deliver what it knows how to deliver and two, we have to ensure 
<br/>that  growth  reaches  every  corner  of  the  country  through  landmark  investments  in  education,  health, 
<br/>agriculture, social protection and, indeed, infrastructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  Mini  Budget  announcement,  commodity  prices  have  remained 
<br/>extremely volatile. Some have recently taken a dip, they could easily rocket back up tomorrow, and those 
<br/>increases do not impact us in isolation.  When fuel prices rise, freight prices rise also and the price of the 
<br/>food that we import rises as well.  When fertiliser prices rise, farming costs rise and so do food prices.  It 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1455 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>takes an elementary grasp of supply chains to understand this.  Fiji does not grow onions, we do no grow 
<br/>wheat, so when food and fuel prices rise due to wars far from home, so does our import bill and so does 
<br/>the  cost  for  local  households.    Internal  cartage  costs  increased  for  cane  trucks,  bus  companies,  taxi 
<br/>operators.  This means that the local crops are affected because they rely on fertiliser to grow and have to 
<br/>be transported to the market in cars, trucks and vans, and those vehicles need fuel to run. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not pulling oil out of wells or in Fijian waters, and ships and trucks do 
<br/>not run on coconut oil.  While it is not the only cause, the Russian war on Ukraine is the most immediate 
<br/>driver of this price increase crisis because it has cut off vital supplies of food, particularly cereals and 
<br/>energy.   President Putin  knows the high cost he is inflicting  on Fiji  and  other  countries  because our 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  has  directly  told  him  that,  for  which  our  honourable  Prime  Minister  has, 
<br/>indeed, been widely commended.   The decision to end the war rests entirely with Russia to be sure, but 
<br/>it would be cowardice for Fiji to suffer in silence along with other vulnerable nations and will continue 
<br/>to use its voice to urge peace. Until such time, we have to contend with the world as it is, not as we wish 
<br/>it would be.  Aside from cost crises driven by shortages, inflation is also skyrocketing globally, as I have 
<br/>mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in part due to disruptions in the supply chain that began during the pandemic 
<br/>and have created scarcities.  Fiji is feeling this as well through the goods that we import.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the last two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a period where they have mattered more than ever, 
<br/></span><span>Government’s social protection measures never waned.  This Budget continues the more than half-a-
<br/>billion dollars’ worth of initiatives previously announced to aid those most vulnerable, which includes 
<br/>the direct subsidy of water and electricity for those earning less than $30,000 annually, subsidies that 
<br/>make  bus  fares more  affordable, the  removal of  market  vendors’  fees that continues, the removal  of 
<br/>export-related fees that continues, and the removal of 20 cents fuel levy that continues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an additional line of defence, we have also removed VAT from that expanded 
<br/>list of 21 essential items in the Mini Budget that continues.  This includes sugar, flour, rice, canned fish, 
<br/>cooking oil, potatoes, onion, garlic, baby milk, powdered milk, liquid milk, dhal, tea, salt, soap, soap 
<br/>powder, toilet paper, sanitary pads, tooth paste, kerosene and cooking gas.  These all remain VAT exempt 
<br/>moving forward.  This unprecedented exemption measure has already saved consumers $50 million since 
<br/>its implementation on 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2022, and will save $163 million over the course of the year - $163 million 
<br/>shaved off the top of the grocery bills and kept in the pockets of the families who need it the most, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  This has cushioned the blow.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We earlier reduced fiscal and import excise duties on over 1,600 items, reduced departure tax, 
<br/>reduced fuel duty, removed ECAL, Stamp Duty, Service Turnover Tax and business licences.  So far, 
<br/></span><span>that has saved an estimated $600 million in taxes that would otherwise be paid.  Fiji’s price controls have 
<br/></span><span>also prevented some commodities from becoming entirely unaffordable for many families, while not 
<br/>pricing those commodities so low that suppliers no longer wish to export them to us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most countries do not have these built-in crisis buffers. We do and, indeed, they are working, Sir.  
<br/>Our price controls and VAT removal, of course, have not stopped the confluence of global crisis, driving 
<br/>up prices and they have offered our citizens some protection.  Just to give an example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>fuel in Fiji is about FJ$3.44 per litre on average.  In New Zealand, it is FJ$4.52 per litre. As prices go 
<br/>higher, we have sought other ways to protect the people as much as we can. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonight, we unveil a six-month $60 million of what we call ‘Inflation Mitigation Package’ to add 
<br/>another buffer between our people’s budgets and the rising cost of goods.  Through this Budget, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we will provide direct cash assistance to the most vulnerable Fijian families based on the 
<br/>number of children in each household.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this applies to all children from newborns to 
<br/>those in Year 13.

<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Carrot! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I hear calls of carrot, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This is the level, I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>digress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wish to address the Fijian people and we wish them to hear what others are 
<br/>saying.  This applies to all children from newborns to those in Year 13, and this will be assessed in 
<br/>December based on where food prices stand at that time as we expect prices to stabilise or even decrease 
<br/>within the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  rollout  this  assistance  through  an  online  application  process  in 
<br/>conjunction  with  the  Ministry  of  Education,  for  Fijian  families  with  a  combined  annual  income  of 
<br/>$50,000 or less.  We will provide $1 per day per child in each family, or $7 a week or around $30 per 
<br/>month, making for a total of $180 per child for the next six months.  A family with three children, for 
<br/>example, will receive $540 in groceries assistance over the next six months.  Any family making under 
<br/>$50,000 a year can access this assistance, even including civil servants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that bump is $1 per day per child, so that is $30 a month.  For six months, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>it is $180 and that is per child. So, if you have three children, you do the mathematics, you will come up 
<br/></span><span>with the amount for the three children.  If you have six children, you multiply $180 by six and that bump 
<br/>makes a big difference.  It can mean the difference between a fish head and a full fish.  It can mean the 
<br/>difference between a full chicken and a soup pack.  It is a difference between fresh fruit or no fruit at all.  
<br/>It is the difference between nutrition or unhealthy snacks, and that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a difference that 
<br/>matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those who have been taking part in the EFL subsidised electricity initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>water subsidy initiative and the bus fare subsidy initiative will be eligible for the subsidy immediately as 
<br/>the  simple  vetting  process  will  be  in  place.    An  online  platform  will  be  developed  similar  to  the 
<br/>vaccination registration process whereby parents will apply online.  Alternatively, Government will set 
<br/>up registration centres for Fijians to apply in person on a needs basis.  For those without connection to 
<br/>electricity  and  in  the  rural  and  maritime  areas,  we  will  make  this  assistance  accessible  through  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education and application will be done through the schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will also apply to families where the children are below school age too and 
<br/>they can also apply.  We, recently during a consultation, met a lady who have four children below the age 
<br/>of five years.  So all her four children will be eligible for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  assist  pensioners  with  the  current  high  inflation  environment,  all  existing  social  welfare, 
<br/>government pension and aftercare fund recipients will receive a payment of $180 over the next six months 
<br/>period.  It is expected, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that around 100,000 Fijians will benefit from this initiative who 
<br/>are on what we call ‘social assistance recipients’.  Similar to the cash support provided to the vulnerable 
<br/>Fijians, it is based on the assistance of $30 per month for the first six months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just because fuel prices are rising it does not mean that our people have any less 
<br/>reason to travel to work, school or to access essential services.  Their travel must be as affordable and 
<br/>reliable  as  we  possibly  can  make  it.    That  is  why  from  1st  August,  2022,  Government  will  directly 
<br/>subsidise bus fare by 10 percent across the board for, at least, the next six months.  We are taking all these 
<br/>costs because we do not believe it is fair to place this burden on the backs of the bus companies.  So when 
<br/>the bus rider pays this new discounted fare, the Government will pay the difference directly to the bus 
<br/>companies.  To pick up that 10 percent cost, $6 million has been allocated in this Budget.  We will make 
<br/>an  advance  payment  to  all  bus  companies  for  the  month  of  August  based  on  previous  records  and 
<br/>reconcile with the acquittal and e-ticketing data every month.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not forgotten our tertiary students.  Regardless of whether they are not 
<br/>TELS  or  Toppers  recipients,  all  Fijian  students  enrolled  in  any  tertiary  institution  -  Fiji  National 
<br/>University (FNU), University of the South Pacific (USP), University of Fiji and any of the other approved 
<br/>institutions, will receive a payout of $180 in a six month period to be paid out in two phases. These 
<br/>include Montfort Boys Town, Nadave and Sangam Fiji. About 30,000 students are expected to benefit 
<br/>from this Scheme also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, strong economies and recoveries for that matter built a strong infrastructure. 
<br/>Now it will be a terrible time to turn away from managing and building the roads, bridges and jetties that 
<br/>connect  the  country,  sustaining  our  recovery  of  the  long-term  demands  landmark  infrastructure 
<br/>investments.  It is the smartest way to support a private sector land recovery.  It is a powerful way to 
<br/>create more livelihoods and support our farmers in rural and maritime communities. The most important 
<br/>way, we continue to build Fiji’s climate resilience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  more  roads  not  fewer,  and  those  roads  must  be  maintained  to  the  highest  possible 
<br/>standards, especially as rain, storms and sea level rise intensify.  People need to get to work, crops need 
<br/>to get to markets and students need to get to school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the next five years, Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) is undertaking a capital works programme 
<br/></span><span>valued at $2.5 billion. In the 2022-2023 financial year, FRA is allocated a total sum of $376.7 million for 
<br/>the  effective  management  and  development  of  Fiji’s  road  network  -  $13.8  million  will  cater  for  the 
<br/>Authority’s operational cost and $362.9 million is to carry out a comprehensive capital works programme 
<br/>to keep up with Fiji’s growing need for new infrastructure and to maintain our existing road network.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $60 million is allocated for FRA’s Ongoing Maintenance Programme - $50 
<br/>million is allocated for the renewal and replacement programme, and a total of $31.4 million is allocated 
<br/>for  ongoing  bridge  construction  for  the  Naseyani  Bridge  in  Rakiraki,  Vunikawakawa  Bridge  in  the 
<br/>Northern Division, Matawalu Bridge, Waidalice Bridge, Vuniyasi Bridge, Yaqara Bridge, most of which 
<br/>will  be  completed  by  September  2022  of  this  year.    In  addition,  funding  is  also  allocated  for  the 
<br/>construction of the new Toga Bridge in Nausori.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has allocated $15 million to help fulfil its commitment to connect 
<br/>our rural communities to our economic centres and key public services. These communities must have 
<br/>the  security  and  connection  to  the  rest  of  the  country  that  a  robust  road  network  will  provide,  and 
<br/>Government will allocate funding to pay new access roads to previously inaccessible communities.  Sir, 
<br/>$3 million is allocated for the upgrade of the Lagi to Tawake Village Road and a new road between 
<br/></span><span>Tawake  to  Wainika  in  Vanua  Levu  near  Udu  Point.    Funding  is  also  provided  for  a  new  road  to 
<br/></span><span>Nasauvakarua in the interior of Viti Levu.  The FRA is also planning to cut the new road from Namosi 
<br/>to  Nasauvakarua  Village.    Sir,  $1  million  is  allocated  for  the  commencement  of  design  and  the 
<br/>construction of the Kavanagasau Road along the Sigatoka East Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major ongoing projects that are timed for completion in the 2022-2023 financial year will require 
<br/>funding for completion include; the Vuci Road Upgrading Project ($3 million) and the upgrade of the 
<br/>Queen Elizabeth Drive, Nasese ($20 million). To explore more feasible options for easing congestion on 
<br/>our roads, $150,000 is allocated for planning, investigation and a survey for Adi Lady Davila Road and 
<br/>the Nadi to Lautoka four lane road.  Investment along these frequently traffic routes will foster growth 
<br/>and development in nearby areas and make the road safer and more reliable for road users.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $145,000 will enable FRA to commence a pre-feasibility investigation into the 
<br/>construction of the Viti Levu cross-country highway - a road that will become one-off, if not, the most 
<br/>ambitious infrastructure projects in the history of the South Pacific.  From a strategic nation-building 
<br/>perspective, such a highway will significantly reduce travel times, for one. It will also unlock serious

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunities  for  our  interior  communities,  who  have  been  constrained  by  the  setup  of  our  national 
<br/>infrastructure network.  The highway will be built section by section, creating jobs along the way, and 
<br/>once completed, Sir, it would be Fiji’s first-ever toll road, bridging the West to our capital, creating for 
<br/>far  greater  social  mobility  and  huge  opportunity  for  commercial,  industrial  and  tourism  expansion 
<br/>throughout Viti Levu’s interior.  It will catapult the value of land in the interior. </span><span>More land will be leased, 
<br/>more Fijians will have access to affordable homes in areas that are made more convenient, and that will create 
<br/>benefits for our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a number of non-FRA assets - roads, crossings and culverts around the country that 
<br/>were initiated as projects through communities and Government Ministries and, therefore, not classified 
<br/>as FRA assets.  Whether you call a road an FRA asset or not, it does not change its value to a community.  
<br/>So an increased allocation of $5.5 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will allow the FRA to upgrade these assets 
<br/>so  the  students  can  get  to  school,  vendors  and  farmers  can  get  to  markets,  those  in  need  of  medical 
<br/>assistance can get to hospitals and people can generally get whatever they are going to.  This, of course, 
<br/>will mean that eventually these roads will have to be transferred to the FRA as their assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  I  have mentioned earlier that we travelled to Tawake Village for budget 
<br/>consultations.  It was actually quite recently that this Government cut the sole road that led to Tawake 
<br/></span><span>Village.  Many communities in Fiji are still unconnected, Sir.  They have no road access and rely entirely 
<br/></span><span>on waterways for travel.  With the rising cost of fuel, it is exorbitantly expensive to even bring your fish 
<br/>from Udu Point to anywhere to a road access.  We have been steadily connecting these communities over 
<br/>the years, though if past Governments had shown the same initiative and had cut just 50 extra kilometres 
<br/>of road every year, all of those communities could have been connected to the nation much more sooner.  
<br/>It is actually a tragedy when you go down and see it on the ground, and here we have people talking about 
<br/>cutting expenditure from FRA. It is our commitment alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that will allow all those 
<br/>isolated villages we have heard directly from, to be connected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $204.3 million is allocated to the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) -  $89.2 million 
<br/>is allocated for operating expenditure, while $115.1 million is allocated for capital investment to improve 
<br/>and  expand  the  nation’s  water  distribution  network  and  wastewater  management  systems.    These 
<br/>networks need to become more reliable, more resilient and more capable of serving a nation on the move.  
<br/>If we do not make these investments now, our children will actually pay for our folly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, WAF provides services to some 772,000 Fijians nationwide and currently has 
<br/>154,383 water and 33,190 wastewater active connections.  Most of the ageing infrastructure that makes 
<br/>up the reticulated system was built around or before our independence.  Its limit present us with major 
<br/>challenges in both, capacity and maintenance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural-urban drift adds another strain.  Currently, there are over 360,000 Fijians residing in the 
<br/>Lami-Nausori corridor.  The current peak day demand in the Lami-Nausori area alone is approximately 
<br/>174 million litres of water a day.  But our current WAF systems at full capacity are able to produce only 
<br/>172 million litres of water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new Rewa River Water Supply Scheme Project which supports the water 
<br/>supply and as a result, the sustainable growth and development in the greater Suva area will now be 
<br/>completed in May 2023 - only nine months from now.  This project, Sir, together represents an investment 
<br/></span><span>of $270 million - the largest water-related investment in Fijian history.  It will end water woes in the 
<br/></span><span>Lami-Nausori corridor through an additional 40 million litres worth of water per day for the benefit of 
<br/>over 360,000 Fijians.  Sir, that amount exceeds current demand by 38 million litres daily.  Of course, it 
<br/>means we can connect to other unconnected areas.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major  service  disruptions  are  also  being  experienced  almost  daily  along  the  Tacirua  East 
<br/>Subdivision Feed Zone.  Due to a land dispute, we could not fully access or utilise the reservoir in the 
<br/>Tacirua East Subdivision.  We have developed an alternative route to the reservoir at a great cost, I might 
<br/>add, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  However, we can soon supply water to the lower Tacirua East Subdivision area.  
<br/>The WAF has been allocated $1.1 billion for the urgent completion of the pipe laying connection works 
<br/>and pipe  connection  works  with Tacirua  East reservoir.   Once the reservoir is commissioned, it  will 
<br/>address the service disruptions and bring much needed relief to Tovata, Khalsa, Nagatugata Feed Zones 
<br/>within the next two to three months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The treated water supply  from the WAF  infrastructure and Nadi system currently ends at the 
<br/>Uciwai Junction along the Queens Road and the Nabila Village past the Uciwai Settlement. It is the only 
<br/>reticulating water supply infrastructure serving the area which is owned by the Fiji National Provident 
<br/>Fund (FNPF).  As part of this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are happy to announce that the Government 
<br/>has acquired the Momi Water Pipeline from the FNPF at a cost of around $2 million, we bought this 
<br/>yesterday.  The ink is still wet on the agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we bought it yesterday which was 
<br/>signed between WAF and FNPF. We will begin connecting a total of 3,999 people along the Uciwai to 
<br/>Nawai corridor and settlements, along the coastline from Uciwai to Korokula to the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total funding of $18.25 million will fund the extension of water supply to 
<br/></span><span>Uciwai, Nalovo, Nawai, the gap between Nabila and Momi Village and school, Nawai Secondary School, 
<br/>Nalovo  Sangam  School,  Savusavu,  Tau,  Korokula,  Bavu,  backpackers  and  upcoming  motels  near 
<br/>Marriott, progressively over the next two to three years.  Out of this $18.25 million, Sir, a budget of 
<br/>$800,000 is allocated under the 2022-2023 financial year to extend that water supply to customers at 
<br/>Nalovo Settlement and people residing along the Queens Road from Uciwai to Nawai Junction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  improvement  works  under  this  funding  shall  include  the  implementation  of  the 
<br/>Nawaicoba Booster Pumps, the reservoirs and its associated water mains, construction of water mains for 
<br/>the extension of water supply to areas mentioned, and further construction of reservoirs with booster 
<br/>pumps at Bavu and Tau, to ensure 24 hours water storage and adequate pressures to cater 24/7 supply to 
<br/>3,999  people  –  primary  and  secondary  schools  and  the  upcoming  hotels  and  resort  development,  as 
<br/>mentioned earlier on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next five years, WAF will be focussing on reducing the amount of 
<br/>water  that  is  lost  in  the  system  by  strengthening  pressure  management  and  leak  detection  activities. 
<br/>Shockingly, little work was done by previous Governments to regularly maintain water infrastructure, 
<br/>and  that  short-sightedness  is  catching  up  to  us.    The  Authority  will  also  streamline  its  activities  by 
<br/></span><span>outsourcing the automation of water and wastewater systems.  We need more private sector efficiency 
<br/></span><span>and effectiveness to get the job done.  It will help us manage assets better and urgently put private sector 
<br/>ingenuity behind our effort to build a climate resilient water and wastewater utility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conserve  more  of  our  water  supply,  we  have  allocated  $1  million  for  the  Rain  Water 
<br/>Harvesting  Programme  and  $5.5  million  to  improving  non-revenue  collection.    For  the  Rain  Water 
<br/>Harvesting Programme, Government will now fund the construction of bases, as well as distribute the 
<br/>water tanks.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we encountered several cases where tanks were ready to be distributed but 
<br/>the bases were not yet built because people could not afford to build the base, so they did not get the water 
<br/>tanks. Government is now taking on both responsibilities in the name of efficiency.  Sir, WAF will be 
<br/>engaging contractors to build these bases across the country to lift this burden from the communities’ 
<br/>backs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also amending the Water Authority Fiji Act 2007 to ensure that WAF 
<br/>can issue infringement notices for offences. This will address offences, such as tampering of WAF assets, 
<br/>illegal or unauthorised connections to our water and sewage reticulation system and trade waste non-

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compliance.  With the introduction of infringement notices, WAF will be strengthening enforcement and 
<br/>compliance to curb these breaches to protect its assets, the communities and, indeed, the environment.  
<br/>Sir, WAF will closely work with relevant stakeholders to educate and raise awareness in this area as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, plumbers provide an essential service in our society and quality of their work 
<br/>underpins the safety of our homes and commercial buildings.  Having a licence ensures that a plumber in 
<br/>Fiji has been tested for his or her knowledge and skill to carry out their work. The amendments to the 
<br/>Water Authority Fiji Act 2007 will enable WAF in partnership with FNU, to issue plumbers licences.  
<br/>The task of providing the necessary training, facilities and examination for all Fijians who want to apply 
<br/>and get certified in this trade will be done by FNU. The Plumbers Licence will integrate and replace the 
<br/>Waterworks Fitters Licence and Drain Layers Licence, previously issued by the Water and Sewerage 
<br/>Department and the Municipal Councils respectively in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government will continue its efforts of improving our water treatment plants 
<br/>and  development  of  water  sources.  Government  will  provide  an  allocation  of  $6.9  million  for  water 
<br/>treatment plants in Waila, Tamavua, Wainibuku, Balevuto, Benau and Naviqiqi; Tasman water tanks for 
<br/>Nadi  Hospital,  Lautoka  Hospitals  and  Tauvegavega,  Tavakubu  and  Nawaicoba  and  water  source  at 
<br/>Vakadredrebua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the Water Distribution Programme, $12 million is allocated for the replacement of old, 
<br/>undersized  and  leaky  water  mains  and  distribution  systems.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $4.9  million  is  also 
<br/>allocated  for  the  Rural  Water  Supply  Programme  in  order  to  provide  access  to  clean  water  in  rural 
<br/>communities - Villages in Navutu, Nauluvatu and Waibalavu in Naitasiri, Dada Government Station, 
<br/>Ratu Simione School in Namosi, Balekinaga Village, Driti Village in Tailevu, Nagatagata Village and 
<br/>Marou Village in Ba, Navola Village, Sariyawa in Nadroga, Vatukacevaceva and Nawairuku Village, 
<br/>Bureiwai  District  School,  Rarapatu  Settlement  in  Ra,  Domonisavu  District  School  in  Cakaudrove, 
<br/>Tavulomo Village in Bua, Bucalevu Combined Scheme and Nakanacagi Village in Macuata.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Energy has been allocated $4 million to install standalone 
<br/>solar home systems in 1,000 homes in remote communities that do not have access to the main EFL grid.  
<br/>This  is  more  affordable,  it  makes  these  communities  more  resilient  by  lessening  their  fossil  fuel 
<br/>dependence and helps us be in line with the low emissions target we have set for ourselves and which we 
<br/>demand from the world.  All 1,000 households will be receiving a Type 2 system, which has a capability 
<br/>of supplying AC loads such as charging laptops, mobile phones, torches, televisions, small radios, fans, 
<br/>small washing machines and any other small loads less than 300 watts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Energy has also been allocated another $1million for the maintenance of the 
<br/></span><span>Type 2 systems, a responsibility that covers around 5,000 systems for the 2022-2023 financial year.  Also 
<br/>there are approximately 1,500 systems on the ground that are Type 1.  It will cost around $6 million to 
<br/>replace the systems to Type 2 and will be done progressively over the next three years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  also  be  assisting  the  Lautoka  City  Council  with  the  upgrade  and 
<br/>installation of the stadium lighting at Churchill Park.  We want the Fijian Drua home games to be also 
<br/>played in the evenings and we need to light up the stadium to make that happen to meet international 
<br/>standards.  Night games get more fans and we saw that right here in Suva at the ANZ Stadium, which I 
<br/>understand now has changed its name to another company that sponsored it - HFC.  They also bring in 
<br/>more viewers around the world.  Sir, $0.5 million will go towards this project to light up Lautoka and, of 
<br/>course, we want the Drua to do really well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $3.4 million is allocated for the shipping services subsidy in the financial year, 
<br/>which will cater for the increase in subsidy rates to the routes around the Scheme.  The increase in subsidy 
<br/>rates will cushion the impact of rising fuel costs and ensure business continuity for vessel operators that

<div><span>service the uneconomical routes in the Franchise Scheme.  Additionally, $100,000 will be allocated to 
<br/>cater for the upgrading and managing of facilities in Vatuyalewa Jetty in Buca Bay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $2.5 million is allocated for the construction of the retaining wall along the 
<br/>Government Shipping Wharf side of the water course.  The project will be undertaken in two phases: 
<br/>Phase 1 will be implemented in 2022-2023 financial year in which 107 metres of retaining wall will be 
<br/>constructed to prevent soil erosion, which can cause severe damage to Government Shipping vessels and 
<br/>the premises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project is pushing ahead, despite some delays.  Nadi’s climate 
<br/>resilience is vital to its residents and the tens of thousands of Fijians working in tourism who rely on the 
<br/>Jetset Town as our international hub and, indeed, a gateway to our country.  Physical works will begin 
<br/>on the drainage system in Nadi Town proper and design works for the widening of the Nadi River to 
<br/>reduce flood risks that have been devastating communities along the river on a yearly basis.  The project 
<br/>has been delayed due to COVID-19, but all efforts are now put in place to expedite the works.  This has 
<br/>to get done and, indeed, it will.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were there only few weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we saw the devastation.  We had one 
<br/></span><span>particular village where people used to plant cane and that 200 metres of cane farm has actually gone and 
<br/></span><span>now become part of the river.  We are funding that effort through a renewed mix of funding commitments 
<br/>from  the  Japanese  and  Australian  Governments,  along  with  the  $5  million  in  Government  funding.  
<br/>Discussions will also be held with the World Bank to gauge the interest in the project funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no form of infrastructure is more determinative for success in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century 
<br/>than  digital  infrastructure.    It  is  the  area  where  Government’s  agenda  is  the  least  anchored  by  past 
<br/>incompetence,  because  the  nation’s  digital  revolution  has  happened  almost  entirely  under  this 
<br/>Government’s watch.  Fiji’s data speeds are superb, data is accessible virtually nationwide, the most 
<br/>remote, rural and maritime pockets of the country are increasingly being reached by satellite network.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under our flagship initiative – digitalFIJI and over the past four years we have launched the full 
<br/>Government  digital  directory  which  enabled  Fijians  to  e-communicate  feedback  directly  to  the 
<br/>Government and track the status of their feedback while they await a response, undertook comprehensive 
<br/>assessments, streamline the process of a number of agencies, massively expedited the digital registration 
<br/>of a newborn; provide a suite of full online ROC services such as companies and businesses, systems, 
<br/>name searches, lodgements, amendments, deregistration and cessation services and ability to make online 
<br/>payments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry’s total budget for 2022-2023 financial year is $53.8 million.  The Ministry will 
<br/>continue to provide and enhance those services and deploy more innovation.  The Ministry will continue 
<br/>to provide and enhance those services and deploy more innovation.  The Ministry will continue to provide 
<br/>internet connectivity to unconnected Fijians through the connectivity rollout programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last November, we connected 26 schools and 14 health centres in the Northern Division.  Of 
<br/>these 40 sites, 20 have Wi-Fi hotspots that provide connectivity for the 17,000 Fijians in the surrounding 
<br/>community.  We had  further identified 59 unconnected  and poorly-connected schools nationwide, of 
<br/>which in the last two months, we have connected nine schools already - Navonu Primary School, Eliki 
<br/>Primary School, Nairukuruku District School, Rewa District School, Saqani High School, Ratu Varani 
<br/>Memorial School, Gau Secondary School, Cautata District School and Mua-i-Ra Methodist College.  Due 
<br/>to transport challenges, the tenth school – Cicia High School in Lau, will be connected by the end of this 
<br/>month.    A  sum  of  $2.5  million  is  allocated  to  connect  an  additional  49  schools  around  Fiji  and  the 
<br/>remaining 35 schools will be connected in the 2023-2024 financial year.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  consultation  with  the  telecommunications  sector,  an  assessment  has  identified  240 
<br/>unconnected and poorly connected sites and these sites have been gazetted as universal service areas for 
<br/>mobile phone connectivity which will be implemented in phases.  As such, 15 tower sites have been 
<br/>identified  under  the  universal  service  areas  project  to  connect,  at  least,  96  unconnected  or  poorly 
<br/>connected areas to voice and internet connectivity.  The tender was advertised earlier this week and while 
<br/>this is being finalised, we anticipate an estimated cost of $11 million for the construction of these towers.  
<br/>This  will  be  funded  from  the  universal  service  fund.    We  will  also  use  the  Telecommunications 
<br/>Development Trust Fund to fund some of the operations and maintenance of the towers that are to be 
<br/>built.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1 million is allocated to the Ministry to conduct a feasibility study and develop 
<br/>implementation plans to build a submarine cable landing station in the western side of Viti Levu.  The 
<br/>Vatuwaqa cable landing station provides over 80 percent of international connectivity for Fiji.  If it ever 
<br/>fails, God forbid, we will lose connectivity to most of the country.  It happened in Tonga recently; it could 
<br/>just  as  well  happen  here.    Building  a  submarine  landing  station  in  the  Western  Division  which  will 
<br/>connect  to  a  different  existing  international  submarine  fibre  optic  cable,  will  increase  resilience  and 
<br/>stability to our telecommunications network and will strengthen our position as the ICT hub of the Pacific.  
<br/>Indeed, many BPOs will only come to Fiji if they know that we have a redundancy line.  In this financial 
<br/></span><span>year,  we  will  engage  a  consultant  to  undertake  a  feasibility  study,  conduct  environmental  and  social 
<br/></span><span>impact  assessment,  develop  implementation  plans  and  engage  a  project  management  consultant  to 
<br/>oversee this important initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have successfully completed the digital switchover awareness project for 
<br/>the  whole  of  Viti  Levu  and  another  $14.6  million  will  be  allocated  to  </span><span>Walesi  </span><span>this  year  to  fund  the 
<br/>completion of digital switchover awareness project for the rest of Fiji.  The continuation of free wireless 
<br/>internet hotspot access across 16 public areas throughout all towns and cities, as well as cover operational 
<br/>expenses to support universal access to information through digital television and radio.  Today, we have 
<br/>over  200,000  households  with  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  set-top  boxes  throughout  Fiji  which  have  connected  through 
<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span>’s 25 transmission sites across Fiji and over 700,000 subscribers to the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> app; 700,000 people 
<br/>watch  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  on  their  phones  now.    In  times  of  disaster,  celebration  and  any  time  the  nation  needs 
<br/>notification, you will be connected on the same national network of news, no matter where in Fiji you 
<br/>reside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  also  provides  free  installations  for  villages  and  community  halls  to 
<br/>enable access to information for disadvantaged and marginalised communities.  Places that have never 
<br/>had  access  to  live  news,  live  sports  and  other  entertainment  and,  indeed,  access  to  parliamentary 
<br/></span><span>proceedings, now have it and through the allocation in this Budget, </span><span>Walesi</span><span> will install an additional 50 
<br/></span><span>community installations - 50 more communities will be part of our national-connected network.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given that COVID-19 is not entirely eradicated and to future-proof our recovery 
<br/>efforts to produce trusted, secure and credible proof of vaccination and test certificates, the Ministry of 
<br/>Communications laid the groundwork for a vaccine registry and subsequently, a Fijian Vaccine Pass.  
<br/>The  Fijian  Vaccine  Pass  is  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  and  EU  General  Data 
<br/>Protection Regulation compliant.  The system has the capability to and with further enhancements, be 
<br/>repurposed  for  future  pandemics  and  also  provide  the  foundational  components  for  the  future  single 
<br/>identification efforts that we have for the national ID card.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As previously announced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Valelevu Shuttle Bus Pilot Programme will serve 
<br/>the greater Nasinu area - the most densely populated area of the country, including the area between 
<br/>Centre Point and Davuilevu in Nakasi.  The shuttle service will cater for around 13 routes by the end 
<br/>of this calendar year at a cost of around $4 million. We will have electric shuttle buses running on 
<br/>these routes representing the first electric public transportation fleet in Fiji.  Aside from making travel

<div><span>cleaner and more convenient, they represent an ambitious and important step towards decarbonising 
<br/>our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, we cannot reach everywhere in Fiji by road, as mentioned earlier 
<br/>on.    In  this  Budget,  we  have  allocated  $500,000  to  subsidise  the  purchase  of  fully  equipped  and 
<br/>operational  fibreglass  boats  for  Fijians  living  in  the  most  isolated  coastal  areas  of  Viti  Levu  and 
<br/>Vanua Levu.  The initiative known as a Seafaring Entrepreneur Assistance or SEA subsidy, furthers 
<br/>our longstanding commitment to the self-starting culture of business in our maritime community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To date, $108,053 has been approved for release and disbursement to 16 applicants.  This 
<br/>half-a-million dollar allocation will fund many more.  Given the large number of requests during the 
<br/>Budget consultation meetings, the subsidy will now be extended to those living in deep rural areas 
<br/>where  there  is  no  road  access.    These  include;  </span><span>Tikina</span><span>  of  Tawake  –  Tawake,  Nagasauva,  Vatu, 
<br/>Wainigadru,  Wainika  and  Yasawa;  Tikina  Udu  -  Cikobia,  Yacata,  Galoa,  Kavewa,  Yaqaqa, 
<br/>Druadrua, Navaidredre, Qamea, Nukuni in Rewa and Bau Island.  This will, of course, be extended 
<br/>to these areas too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s airports are our bridge to the world and the foundation of our tourism 
<br/></span><span>industry’s recovery.  We have been searching exhaustively for management entity to implement a 
<br/></span><span>customer centric and capital  intensive vision  to expand the reach of our airports  and improve the 
<br/>quality of service offered to  travellers.  Naming an outside manager for Fiji  Airports is  not  at  all 
<br/>uncommon.  Changi Airport in Singapore may be the best in the world, its operation and management 
<br/>are also handled by an outsider operator.  Qatar Airways Group also manage the Hamad International 
<br/>Airport (HIA).  We did not have to look far to find world leading aviation management expertise. 
<br/>Despite going up against larger and better resource competitors, our national carrier - Fiji Airways, 
<br/>flies in the vast majority of all visitors to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the next early months of our recovery, they flew in nearly all of our visitors.  There is a 
<br/>reason  people  choose  to  fly  like  a  Fijian,  Fiji  Airways  provides  incomparable  service  while 
<br/>competing  vigorously  to  maintain  comparable  fares.    The  point,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  the  Fiji 
<br/>Airways model of service delivery has not only been honed against the best of the best, it has wider 
<br/>application across our aviation sector where their management team has deep industry knowledge.  
<br/>After considerable deliberation, Sir, we have identified Fiji Airways as a national partner to manage 
<br/>Fiji Airport’s operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have since finalised a management agreement to leverage Fiji Airways’ culture of world 
<br/></span><span>class customer service and strategic investment for the benefit of every airport in the country.  This 
<br/></span><span>administrative  change  will  not  affect  their  business,  mission,  Board  of  Directors,  governance 
<br/>structure, compliance or staff of Fiji Airports.  It is still a business that prioritises shareholder value 
<br/>and connecting Fiji to itself and to the world.  Fiji Airways will simply become responsible for the 
<br/>day to day operations, with the relentless focus on the customers which in this case, everyone who 
<br/>uses Fijian airports, our citizens and visitors alike, from baggage handling to gate management, retail 
<br/>experience and every other service known by the public, unseen by the public also in the industry as 
<br/>below the wing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have successfully employed an outside operator before at  Fiji  Ports Terminal  Limited 
<br/>where cargo handling has improved by 60 percent, average turnaround time for vessels increased 
<br/>from 36 hours to 20 hours and average berthing time per vessel reduced from six hours to one hour 
<br/>or less. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Airways  management  mandate  will  be  to  step  up  airport  infrastructure  nationwide, 
<br/>meaning to upgrade our existing airports and build new ones.  Starting in Nadi, they will upgrade the

<div><span>baggage handling and air site infrastructure and enhance the arrival experience, improve customer 
<br/>amenities at Nausori Airport and review our outer island facilities, including Labasa and Savusavu 
<br/>with an eye for major capital development opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, housing is a form of infrastructure that belongs with the people as an asset 
<br/>they can grow in value and pass on to their children, but ensuring access to adequate housing is about 
<br/>more  than  any  financial  benefit.    It  is  about  security,  it  is  in  fact  about  dignity,  ownership  and 
<br/>optimism for families.  Through its Informal Settlement Upgrade and Formalisation Programme, the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  acquires  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board  (iTLTB) 
<br/>development leases and State leases where it is  necessary, predominately iTLTB leases, and then 
<br/>adds the infrastructure necessary to formalise settlements and make them worthy places to call home; 
<br/>they get a 99-year lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has acquired a total of 42 development leases to 
<br/>safeguard low income families and also ensure that landowning units are adequately compensated 
<br/>with premium and annual rental payments that are funded directly by Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annually, the Ministry of Housing pays close to $300,000 in rental payments for these 42 
<br/></span><span>development  leases.  The  2022–2023  Budget,  funding  has  been  allocated  to  acquire  two  more 
<br/></span><span>development leases; Valemasima and Sakoca Stage 2.  After acquisition, these leases will be placed 
<br/>into  the  informal  settlement  upgrade  work  plan.    Of  the  42  existing  development  leases,  12  are 
<br/>currently  in  the  tender  stage  for  the  engagement  of  a  contractor  and  six  are  currently  in  the 
<br/>engineering phase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Housing and Community Development has been provided an allocation of 
<br/>$9.8 million to run the informal settlement upgrade and formalisation programme in the 2022–2023 
<br/>financial  year.  Through the revised 2021–2022  Budget,  we,  as  the Government  stood up  for the 
<br/>injustice faced by Fijians seeking affordable housing at Lagilagi or Jittu Estate as commonly known.  
<br/>We have discussed this scam in detail in previous budgets so there is no need to review the details 
<br/>again now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to know for budget purposes is that the magnitude of 
<br/>the fraud became clearer once the reimbursement application process began.  The Ministry received 
<br/>more than 655 applications, at least 318 more than we initially expected and has already paid out a 
<br/>little over $2.2 million to date to over 336 applicants.  We are now allocating $1.9 million for the 
<br/>2022-2023 financial year to reimburse the remaining 318 victims of the scam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  as  the  Government  of  the  day  see  it  as  our  responsibility  to  return  the  funds  to  our 
<br/>wronged citizens and  finally heal  the wounds left  by People’s Community  Network  (PCN).  The 
<br/>revised Social Housing Assistance Policy aims to introduce more sustainable and climate resilient 
<br/>housing assistance to those who need it the most.  The recipients must be members of the land owning 
<br/>unit if they are building their home within the community boundaries or they hold a freehold or a 
<br/>lease title for the land they want to build on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  the  2022–2023  Budget,  the  Ministry  has  provided  an  allocation  of  $1  million  to 
<br/>implement the revised Social Housing Policy with successful applicants eligible for a maximum grant 
<br/>of $10,000 for the purchase and transportation of building materials.  I say transportation because 
<br/>many of these communities are in the maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Koroipita Model Towns Charitable Trust is a non-governmental organisation committed 
<br/>to  building  engineered  and  service  subdivisions  and  cyclone  safe  houses  for  low  income  Fijian 
<br/>households.    The  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Developments  is  allocated  $2.1million  to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide shelter to 105 more families in desperate need of safe accommodation under Koroipita Stage 
<br/>4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also taking steps to house more civil servants through opportunities 
<br/>for  private  investors  to  construct  and  operate  strata  title  housing  quarters  that  are  available 
<br/>exclusively to civil servants and their families.  We will be starting by making the first crop of units 
<br/>available  to  the  Fiji  Police  Force.    Over  the  long  term,  this  will  ensure  that  civil  servants  can 
<br/>affordably own homes and elevate pressure on the wider housing community and market, extending 
<br/>the same benefit for all home buyers and builders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and finally on the subject of infrastructure, I wish to quickly review the 
<br/>current projects under tender and advertisement.  We provided funding in the next financial year to 
<br/>break  ground on a new  Fiji  Pharmaceutical  and  Biomedical  Services Warehouse, the subdivision 
<br/>construction works for Sasawira Informal Settlement, the design and build for the existing dormitory 
<br/>at  Ratu  Kadavulevu  School,  the  upgrading  of  the  Savusavu  Market,  the  rehabilitation  and 
<br/>construction of schools in Kadavu  and Southern  Lau and the design and  build of the Nabouwalu 
<br/>Passenger Terminal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  now  turn  to  one  of  the  most  important  pillars  of  a  sustained 
<br/></span><span>recovery  and  which  is  of  course  not  built  on  bricks  and  mortar,  it  is  built  by  knowledge  gained 
<br/>through  education.    The  pandemic  changed  the  global  labour  market  in  defining  enduring  ways.  
<br/>Despite moving on to recovery, many advanced economy still suffer debilitating workplace shortages 
<br/>in health care, hospitality, education and other service sectors in air transport and other industries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To fill these gaps, many developed countries are poaching skilled workers from developing 
<br/>countries like Fiji.  There was a recent advertisement in our newspapers offering to pay Fijian chefs 
<br/>with three years or more experience up to AUD80,000 to AUD120,000 annually to work in Australia 
<br/>because there is a shortage of chefs in Australia.  There is no wonder why our citizens are in demand, 
<br/>we  have  incredible  people  and  this  Budget  also  makes  our  biggest  ever  commitment  to  their 
<br/>education.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same generation features empowered by free education have benefitted from $1.2 billion 
<br/>in Government support towards tertiary scholarships and study loans.  In the next financial year, that 
<br/>commitment will be strengthened by a $162.6 million allocation to fund scholarships, study loans 
<br/>and grants. We will award more scholarships, more student loans and more grants in the next financial 
<br/>year than any other year in Fijian history, funding a total of 9,200 scholarships and student loans in 
<br/></span><span>addition  to  2,000 grants  for what  we call “micro qualifications” for skills to  meet  the anticipated 
<br/></span><span>boom in our construction sector and combat the overseas poaching of our skilled workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  current  system,  students  who  were  pursuing  qualifications  which  require  an 
<br/>industry attachment have been at the mercy of the markets with regards to what they are paid. Because 
<br/>these  attachments  are  required,  there  are  very  little  leverage  to  negotiate  competitive  allowance. 
<br/>Pursing an education should not mean accepting the bare minimum of living standards and we do not 
<br/>want to push that cost of higher allowances onto the employers. Government is currently paying $100 
<br/>a month in allowance to students completing industrial attachments under TSLS sponsorship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Budget, we go further to also provide that $100 a month top-up to private students for 
<br/>the first time. If I am a private student, for example, studying mechanics or pastry chef and I have to 
<br/>get an attachment then we will give you the $100. This grant assistance requirements will be able to 
<br/>meet  their  graduation  requirement  in  the  student’s  programme  of  choice,  with  no  extra  strings 
<br/>attached. Many of these people cannot complete it because they cannot get a work placement.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To boost employment in our construction sector, Sir, we will also provide 200 awards as a 
<br/>one-off grant for up to $500 per student for those who do not meet the eligibility for scholarships and 
<br/>study loans. These students are looking to enter the job market with skills that can earn them a decent 
<br/>living instead of facing unemployment.  This grant funding will help them obtain what we call “micro 
<br/>qualifications” in a construction related skilled course over a period of two weeks or to one month.  
<br/>Once that education is completed, they can go on to become tile layers, painters, cabinet makers, 
<br/>joiners,  block  layers,  plumbers  and  other  professions  that  are  critical  to  the  national  network  of 
<br/>modern infrastructure we are building every day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  an  aside,  when  the  Christchurch  earthquake  took  place  in  the  huge 
<br/>rebuild, many of our bricklayers, plumbers, tilers and plaster men and women went away because 
<br/>they took them on short-term visas and they have been now granted long-term visas.  So, we were 
<br/>left with this gap.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not to mention, Mr. Speaker, these students can go on to study diplomas and certificates in 
<br/>more advanced areas once they acquire enough practical knowledge. This grant will be targeted but 
<br/>not limited to those who do not meet eligibly criteria for scholarships and student loans. But to be 
<br/>clear, Sir, this is not a loan and there are no strings attached because we really need to fill in this gap 
<br/></span><span>because we are seeing now, many in the construction sector are hiring workers from Bangladesh, 
<br/></span><span>they bring them from Philippines. We want our people to get the first opportunity if they have the 
<br/>skill sets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us also be clear in saying that TVET is not a second class education and 
<br/>the professionals produced through its study programmes are no less critical to the building of the 
<br/>nation than any other. We need mechanics, we need plumbers, electricians, welders, joiners as much 
<br/>as we need any profession in Fiji. These are important skills and they should be branded an equally 
<br/>respected as such.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  this  Budget  we  will  rebrand  TVET  to  what  we  call  “Skills  Qualification”  in 
<br/>recognition of the value these skills offer our economy. To ensure that equal respect is given, the 
<br/>Government will introduce a new scholarship scheme known as “Skills Qualification” at FNU with 
<br/>200 awards.  The cut-off mark for this new scholarship scheme will be 250 in Year 13 or 270 in Year 
<br/>12.  The Government will also reinstate the National Toppers Overseas Scheme which was suspended 
<br/>because  it  was  entirely  impractical  to  send  students  overseas  due  to  pandemic  related  travel 
<br/>restrictions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can now make up for lost time. The previous allocation to these 
<br/></span><span>scholarships will double next year to 40; 30 of those will be for Degree Programmes in Engineering, 
<br/>Medicines, Science, Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry, IT, Architecture, et cetera which is not available 
<br/>in Fiji; five will be for working people in public sector organisations and five for the newly branded 
<br/>skills qualifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first time for studies in Fiji, we will allocate 10 PhD Research Scholarships and 20 
<br/>Masters Research Scholarships for full time studies.  Three awards for the Masters Scholarships will 
<br/>be  ring-fenced  for  the  newly  formed  Monash  University-FNU  Pacific  Island  Countries  (PICs) 
<br/>Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC). The areas of study will be Medicine, Health, Science, 
<br/>Engineering, Climate Change and Environmental Science as mentioned, Marine Science, Forestry, 
<br/>Public Policy, Public Financing, Economic Modelling and ICT.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  recipients  of  these  PhD  and  Masters  Awards  will  have  compulsory  bonding  with 
<br/>employers who are classified as Fijian entities.  These post graduate level opportunities for our best 
<br/>and brightest are born for a push for innovation, our focus on research that can solve our greatest

<div><span>challenges  and  the  creation  of  new  knowledge  that  strengthens  the  foundation  of  our  talented 
<br/>workforce and knowledge-based society and indeed our young people.  We do not always need the 
<br/>world to solve our challenges for us, we will find home-grown leading experts that can solve our 
<br/>challenges alongside the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government will increase the National Toppers Local Scheme Award from 547 to 770 
<br/>with 40 awards to MBBS, five for Bachelor of Dental Surgery and 40 for Nursing.  The scholarship 
<br/>cut-off  mark  for  the  nursing  programme  will  be  300  in  Year  13.    We  are  making  landmark 
<br/>investments and launching innovated policies to expand the rich and quality of health care in Fiji 
<br/>including surgeries that have not been offered in Fiji before.  We need more doctors, more nurses 
<br/>and more dentists amongst other specialists to deliver on our commitment to a healthier Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of our teachers Mr. Speaker, Sir, are being poached by overseas educational systems 
<br/>as well.  Recently, about 60 teachers were acquired by Australia.  The Government will allocate 165 
<br/>scholarships  for  teacher  training  in  Maths  and  Physics,  Industrial  Arts,  Primary  Education  and 
<br/>Computer Science.  The scholarship scheme for students with special needs will continue.  Awards 
<br/>for the in-service scheme will increase from 120 to 140 awards, of which 100 will be for public sector 
<br/>organisations and 40 also for the private sector and state-owned enterprises.  For anyone at home 
<br/></span><span>doing the maths, this announcement mean that the total number of scholarships for the next financial 
<br/></span><span>year has doubled to 1,200.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know students are keen to know how they can apply.  
<br/>The full eligibility criteria will be published by TSLS and the Fijian scholarship scheme regulations 
<br/>and online. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijian students lost out on significant hours of learning in 2021 which was 
<br/>the  toughest  year  for  Year  12  students  who  are  now  in  Year  13  and  preparing  to  go  into  tertiary 
<br/>education.  Therefore the cut-off mark for TELS for degree level programmes will remain at 250 
<br/>except  for  Commerce  discipline  where  it  will  be  280  excluding  Accounting,  Economics  and 
<br/>Management or Administration where the cut-off mark will be 300. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For TELS, the skills qualification to FNU, the eligibility will be a pass in Year 12, Certificate 
<br/>I or II from the Fiji Higher Education Commission recognised institutions or an offer letter obtained 
<br/>from FNU.  The Government will allocate 2,800 TELS for degree level programmes.  Nursing will 
<br/>have  200  allocations  and  there  will  be  an  increased  allocation  for  teacher  training,  ICT, 
<br/>Environmental and Marine Science disciplines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Skills  qualification  from  Levels  III,  IV  and  V  at  FNU  will  have  4,600  allocations.    The 
<br/></span><span>existing  employees  scheme  will  be  expanded  and  rebranded  as  existing  employee  entrepreneur 
<br/></span><span>scheme with 100 allocations fund both employees and entrepreneurs to obtain a qualification to the 
<br/>level of certificate, diploma and degree.   Should an entrepreneur running his or her own business 
<br/>can pursue an accounting certificate or business management certificate, for example, that is vital to 
<br/>his or her business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government will also introduce two new schemes under TELS.  The 
<br/>first is the qualification upgrade that allows those who were have never been funded by TSLS as well 
<br/>as those who have  repaid their loans in  full to  the bachelor level  to  upgrade to  the post  graduate 
<br/>diploma level.  In addition, those holding a certificate or a diploma who have been funded by TSLS 
<br/>will be allowed to complete up to a degree programme to gain competitive edge for employment if 
<br/>they are not currently working.  Sir, 400 of these student loans will be available in the next financial 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second is skills qualification for other tertiary education providers, including FNU and 
<br/>others.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example, we have already stressed how important these careers are to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fijian economy.  In some cases, we face such a serious dearth in professions like tile laying where 
<br/>we  have  had  to  import  skilled  labourers  as  mentioned  earlier  on.    These  are  jobs  that  our  people 
<br/>should be qualified to do and paid to do.  This scheme will fund skills qualification and this is what 
<br/>we  call  “blue  collar  jobs”  such  as  fitting  and  machining,  automotive  body  works,  carpentry, 
<br/>fabrication and welding, joinery and cabinet making, plumbing and sheet metal, refrigeration and air-
<br/>conditioning,  automotive  electrical  and  on  electronics,  construction  and  tile  laying  as  well.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, 100 of these student loans will be available in the next financial year.  The eligibility 
<br/>will  be  a  pass  in  Year  12,  Certificate  I  or  Certificate  II  from  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission 
<br/>recognised institution or an offer letter from preferred eligible institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tertiary  education  providers,  Nadave  Centre  for  Appropriate  Technology  (CATD)  and 
<br/>Montfort Boys Town were not eligible for the TSLS funding and sponsorship can now apply and be 
<br/>included under this scheme provided they meet all of the TSLS criteria. In total, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>makes  another  8,000  Students’  loans.  This  criteria  will  also  be  published  by  the  TSLS,  the  TELS 
<br/>Regulation and available online.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we currently have $581 billion in outstanding of TELS debts.  The FRCS and 
<br/>TELS have recently signed an MOU to ensure that loans are paid as fairly as possible and with the full 
<br/></span><span>co-operation  of  employers.    We  will  be  acquiring  specific  provision  employed  in  New  Zealand  that 
<br/></span><span>obligates an employer to notify TSLS on Government funded students recruit for employment.  We had 
<br/>announced previously an accelerated payment schedule for TELS recipients that would allow them to 
<br/>access huge discounts or up to 50 percent in their repayments.  After some discussion with the banks, we 
<br/>are  pleased  to  announce  that  we  can  go  further.    As  the  banks,  we  had  a  meeting  with  them  in  fact 
<br/>yesterday, are willing to come forward to refinance loans for students so that they can take advantage of 
<br/>these discounts.  Additionally, a 100 percent tax deduction will be available to companies on the amount 
<br/>of  tuition,  living  expenses  paid  for  students  at  a  higher  education  institution  specified  in  the  Higher 
<br/>Education Act 2008.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a responsible practical strategy that ensures the long-term sustainability 
<br/>in Fiji’s education revolution. We are a young country, let us not forget, 70 percent of Fijians are under 
<br/>the age of 40, 65 percent are under the age of 35, this young generation Fijians will have families and 
<br/>they will have children, it will cripple the nation financially to offer scholarships for all as we prepared to 
<br/>put  this  historic  numbers  of  young  people  through  high  education.  It  is  not  sustainable.    Since  its 
<br/>introduction, TELS had empowered over 50,000 students to access higher education, otherwise they have 
<br/>not been able to afford.  We can empower 100 or 1,000 more through the years ahead provided we keep 
<br/>on the path of sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are conducting a review to ensure the smaller schools and more isolated 
<br/>areas are getting equitable funding’s through the free education grant.  We will also grant more flexibility 
<br/>for schools with the grants we pay them so that they can now use the free education grant to also make 
<br/>lease rental payments to whoever they lease the land from and cover insurance costs to school buildings, 
<br/>including fire and cyclone insurance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry  of Education,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  engages more than 500  rural  services  transport 
<br/>providers who drive more than 34,000 students to school on a daily basis.  These are small, what we call 
<br/>minibus  operators  RSL  operators,  many  of  whom  regularly  go  beyond  the  call  of  duty  to  transport 
<br/>students in rural areas to their classrooms, a lot of them live in their own villages to transport students.  
<br/>The rise in fuel price that has hit these folks is really hard therefore, in this budget, we are increasing the 
<br/>current RSL voucher by 36.3 percent. This increase is in line with the increase for bus fare and will help 
<br/>rural transport providers to stay in operation and cover their costs. It is about our children going to school, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  All of whom everywhere in the country and we thank these operators for the great 
<br/>length they go literally to make sure our education revolution reaches every corner of Fiji.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sport and education go hand in hand, both require investment in people to reach 
<br/>their  full  potential  and  this  budget  delivers  on  both  fronts.    The  2022-2023  Financial  Year,  the 
<br/>Government is allocating a total of $6.9 million for sports grants that will support the development of 
<br/>sport activities in our communities, $1.9 million has been allocated to assist and enhance the performance 
<br/>of Fiji’s National Team through participation at regional and international tournaments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, funding in the new financial year has been prioritised for the following sporting 
<br/>activities Athletics, Rugby Union, Netball, Basketball, Cricket, Hockey and Weightlifting.  Sir, $79,500 
<br/>has been allocated to support overseas training for elite athletes and technical officials.  Funding with the 
<br/>new financial year has been prioritised for the following sporting activities, Rugby League, Swimming, 
<br/>Tennis and Yachting.  Regional and international tournaments are huge source of economic activity for 
<br/>Fiji, investments bring these events to Fiji to pay back massive returns.  $2 million has been allocated to 
<br/>support the hosting of international tournaments in the new financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Sports Commission aims to host the following national sporting events, Australian 
<br/>Football  League  Fiji,  Athletics,  Basketball,  Cycling,  Football  Association,  Netball,  Rugby  League, 
<br/>Rugby Union, Squashed, Tennis and Yachting.  Sir, $1.6 million allocation will ensure that the promising 
<br/>elite athletes are exposed to intense high level of training required to participate, renounce competition in 
<br/></span><span>order  to  better  improve  the  country  ranking  at  world  events.    The  funding  will  directly  support  the 
<br/></span><span>engagement of support coaches in Footballs, Netball, Rugby League, Rugby Union and Yachting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  $500,000  in  funding  will  assist  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  to  develop  a  sports 
<br/>programme in rural communities to hold basic skills in the range of sports and identify clear career paths 
<br/>for young people.  The funding will cater for the following sports: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports Community Camp programmes; 
<br/>Train the Trainer Programmes; 
<br/>Educate the Educator Programme; 
<br/>Children in Community Inclusive Sports Programme; and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $200,000 has been provided for the engagement of the local and international 
<br/>experts to assist in sports development in the country.  The programme aims to support the training and 
<br/>development of the local athletes and sports administrators to international standards in several sports for 
<br/>men and women.  The Government continues to ensure inclusivity and equality by supporting sports.  
<br/>Physical activities and development for people with disabilities and special needs, the funding provision 
<br/></span><span>of $60,000 in the new financial year will cater for the Paralympics in special schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 financial year funding of $654,466 has been allocated to support the growth of 
<br/>minor  sporting  activities  including  volleyball,  netball,  badminton  and  futsal.    The  funding  has  been 
<br/>allocated to support the construction of the two hardcourts in Kamikamica Park in Lautoka and Tataiya 
<br/>in Rakiraki and the construction of Multipurpose Courts in Tuatua Housing in Labasa and in Vunidawa, 
<br/>Naitasiri.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a young population, as I have mentioned, 65 percent are below the age 
<br/>of  35  years,  and  70  percent  are  below  40  years,  and  these  young  people  will  have  children  and 
<br/>sustainability, of course, is a key also in the sporting area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic forced us to innovate and implement the Free General Practitioner 
<br/>Scheme or the Free GP Scheme, as it has become known, to allow Fijians who used to rely on the public 
<br/>health system to seek consultations and treatments at private GP clinics at Government’s cost.  We did 
<br/>that out of necessity and we have kept the programme because it works.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1 million is allocated for the Free GP Scheme for the 2022-2023 Budget.  An 
<br/>additional 23 GPs have been selected to provide free medical services to the general public.  With the 
<br/>inclusion of the additional 23 GPs, there will now be 38 private GPs in a total of 40 outlets throughout 
<br/>the nation, providing medical service to ordinary Fijians with all cost borne by the Government.  The GPs 
<br/>have  now  also  been  selected  in  Korovou,  Nausori,  Nakasi,  Nadera,  Suva,  Navua,  Sigatoka,  Nadi, 
<br/>Lautoka, Ba, Tavua, Labasa and Savusavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  remind  everyone,  as  previously  announced,  the  Government  funded 
<br/>medical services on offer at these clinics include consultations, reviews, referrals, injections, dressing, 
<br/>including minor dressings.  We have now added six new services to that on 20</span><span>th</span><span> June to the Free GP 
<br/>Scheme: multi urine dip stick, Electro Cardiogram (ECG), nebuliser, oxygen supply, ultra sound scan 
<br/>and the sugar prick test.  Approved laboratory testing service under the Scheme will also provide testing 
<br/>for sugar levels, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, cholesterol level, glycated haemoglobin, 
<br/>liver function, renal function or kidney function.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced previously, to expand these various initiatives, another $200,000 is allocated to 
<br/>incentivise private GPs to establish new clinics in densely populated, what we call  in peri-urban and rural 
<br/>areas including Nawaicoba, Malolo, Naidovi, Drasa, Sabeto, Seaqaqa, Dreketi, Nasarawaqa, Korolevu 
<br/></span><span>and Pacific Harbour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the revised 2021-2022 Budget, it was also announced that Government will 
<br/>engage  private  Dental  Practitioners,  to  improve  the  oral  health  of  all  Fijians  including  school  aged 
<br/>children  through  Government  funded  access  to  private  dental  care.    There  are  currently  four  Dental 
<br/>Practitioners under the Scheme who provide consultation, oral examination, extraction, temporary filling 
<br/>and permanent filling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $500,000 is allocated for the private Dental Practitioner’s Scheme in 2022-2023 
<br/>Budget.  This partnership is to ease the burden on the public medical facilities and grants patients who 
<br/>used to depend fully on the public health system access to high quality health care more quickly without 
<br/>waiting in long queues.  This initiative is also an opportunity for dentists to grow their patient base and 
<br/>support the public health system in providing the necessary medical care to all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government in consultation with Fiji Care is finalising the launching of a dedicated 
<br/>website  for  the  initiative  together  with  the  Online  Patient  Information  System,  which  is  expected  to 
<br/>streamline necessary processes for the administration of the initiative.  Through this online platform, GPs 
<br/>in the Scheme will have access to all these patients seen under the PPT Scheme.  Necessary amendments 
<br/></span><span>to the Acts and Regulation will be put in place for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also broaden the availability of medical and dental services by allowing 
<br/>Medical and Dental Practitioners engaged in PPT Scheme to prescribe, supply and dispense essential 
<br/>medicines for 24 hour period, as approved by the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services.  This means it grants flexibility to patients.  If I go and see a doctor at night and I need 
<br/>medicine urgently and the pharmacy nearby may be closed or far away, the doctor can actually give me 
<br/>medicine enough to last me until I can go to a chemist when it opens the next day.  This is not going to 
<br/>upend the pharmaceutical sector but in fact provide essential services.  Prescriptions in the clinical level 
<br/>will only be permitted, if the nearest pharmacy is closed, otherwise these operators will be fined.  The 
<br/>medicines  that  the  medical  practitioners  will  supply  and  dispense  include  amoxicillin  capsules, 
<br/>flucloxacillin capsules, ibuprofen, paracetamol and oral rehydration salt and the medicines that the dental 
<br/>practitioner  in  the  PPT  Scheme  will  be  able  to  supply  and  dispense  include  ibuprofen  tablets  and 
<br/>paracetamol.

<div><span>1471 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also continue to engage private medical laboratories for laboratory analysis and blood 
<br/>samples referred by GPs engaged under the Free GP Scheme.  There are seven laboratories currently 
<br/>engaged under the Scheme and $500,000 is allocated for the Private Medical Laboratory Scheme in the 
<br/>2022-2023 Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the engagement of these laboratories will ensure that GPs participating in this 
<br/>Scheme have reliable access to affordable and high-quality laboratories, an essential component in the 
<br/>successful prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2022-2023 Budget, Sir, $1 million is allocated for the outsourcing of biomedical facilities 
<br/>like  x-ray  machines,  MRI  scan  machines,  ultrasound  machines,  CT  scanners  including  public  health 
<br/>system laboratories and to be maintained and operated 24/7 by the private sector in public hospitals.  The 
<br/>reason is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, experts in this highly technical sector are highly in demand globally. 
<br/>When a public employee is poached, there is no one often who can be quickly trained to fill the role.  
<br/>Outsourcing this aspect of care makes us more resilient to staffing shortages and also grant us immediate 
<br/>access to the highest level of technicians for even the most sophisticated devices.  Overall, this move 
<br/>reduces  cost,  improves  the  reliability  of  services  to  general  public  and  improves  the  equipment 
<br/>performance and longevity.  We have three major capital projects earmarked for the Ministry of Health 
<br/></span><span>and Medical Services in 2022-2023 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first is Savusavu Hospital which is one of the three subdivisional hospitals in the Northern 
<br/>Division.  It offers a wide stream of services but the facility itself has been plagued by severe weather.  
<br/>Heavy rains combined with insufficient drainage have resulted in its rapid deterioration.  In this Budget, 
<br/>$2 million will go towards engaging a contractor to begin the much-needed and frankly, long-awaited 
<br/>refurbishment and land stabilisation works at the Savusavu Hospital.  This is great news for residents and 
<br/>for the future of Savusavu’s local economy.  Major investments in the area are putting our hidden paradise 
<br/>on the map and quality and reliable healthcare is a pillar of Savusavu’s sustainable tourism development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other two are the construction of the new CWM Hospital Maternity Ward and the upgrade 
<br/>of the Labasa Hospital interior works which had been delayed almost entirely due to the pandemic.  It 
<br/>was impractical, if not impossible to manage major renovations while these facilities were the frontline 
<br/>of COVID-19 response.  While these projects have been delayed, they will still be delivered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  next  financial  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $5.2  million  will  go  towards  these  projects.    The 
<br/>Ministry will be completing the tender stage and engage a suitable contractor to initiate the planned capital 
<br/>works.  It is good news for the north and for expectant mothers and families in our Central Division.  We 
<br/></span><span>have procured a new brand or a brand new hyperbaric chamber at CWM which is used for emergencies 
<br/></span><span>relating to scuba diving, an important assurance for tourists who dive in our waters and a third of the 
<br/>Fijian  population  who  rely  on  the  sea.    All  allocation  of  $120,000  for  the  final  instalment  has  been 
<br/>budgeted for in 2022-2023, to make the final payment on the chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s farms have never been more productive.  That is a fact.  Agriculture is not 
<br/>in decline in this country. It is at high records.  In 2021 alone, crop production increased from 296,579 to 
<br/>320,806  MT  or  metric  tonnes,  an  increase  by  8.1  percent.  One  major  driver  of  that  growth  is 
<br/>mechanisation.    Over  the  years,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  has  been  supporting  farmers  through 
<br/>provision of farm machinery on hired basis and highly subsidised rates.  The hired rate for these machines 
<br/>including tractors, excavators and bulldozers and rice harvesters is at $28 per hour across the board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  has  further  mechanisation  but  the  Ministry  continues  to  receive  daily  complaints  from 
<br/>farmers who are still waiting to be provided with farm machinery.  To help meet this demand, government 
<br/>will  outsource  the  provision  of  machinery  to  farmers  through  a  $7  million  allocation.    Tractors, 
<br/>excavators, bull and swamp dozers and harvesters will be hired to farmers on a 50-50 basis.   Stepping

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up  mechanisation  and,  therefore,  agriculture  production  will  allow  us  to  seize  market  opportunities, 
<br/>especially  niche  areas  like  turmeric.    We  expect  this  assistance  will  also  support  farmers  who  have 
<br/>engaged in horticultural crops, root crops, turmeric, kava, rice and livestock.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaking of livestock, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced in the revised 2021-2022 Budget, the Fijian 
<br/>Government will be assisting commercial livestock farmers to raise farm productivity to improve the 
<br/>competitiveness and overall sustainability of the livestock sector. Sir, $350,000 is allocated to the 2022-
<br/>2023 financial year for what we call SELF which is targeted support for large scale livestock farmers 
<br/>who  have  traditionally  not  received  government  support.    This  direct  assistance  to  purchase 
<br/>additional livestock will allow commercial livestock farmers to achieve the scale necessary to better 
<br/>support local demand and export livestock to foreign markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the long-term this will produce high quality meats, eggs and other animal products at lower 
<br/>prices (I should not say eggs but embryos).  Under this assistance Mr. Speaker, Sir, livestock farmers 
<br/>can receive a grant up to $10,000 towards the purchase of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats including the 
<br/>purchase of water tanks and fencing materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Antimicrobial resistance is increasing concerning global health and issues affecting people 
<br/></span><span>and livestock.  Essentially, bacteria becoming more resistant to the tools we have long relied on to 
<br/></span><span>fight them.  Fiji in this case lacks the access to qualified veterinarians who can treat the resistant 
<br/>trends  of  bacteria.    We  are  doing  amendments  or  carrying  out  amendments  to  the  Veterinaries 
<br/>Surgeons  Act  to  allow  for  the  local  graduates  to  be  registered  as  para  veterinarians  under  the 
<br/>Veterinarian Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the interim we are making provisions for those who have Bachelor of Veterinaries and is 
<br/>to be registered as para veterinarians and provide service in animal health production. We will be 
<br/>calling on para veterinarians to take a lead role in providing veterinarian services directly to livestock 
<br/>farmers in Fiji.  We will establish para veterinarian clinics, privately they can do so where registered 
<br/>para veterinarians will work with farmers to maintain animal welfare, health and hygiene.  They will 
<br/>know how much to administer to the animals and they can set up their own business.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  case,  students  who  have  graduated  with  a  Bachelor  of  Veterinarian  Science  can 
<br/>undertake  a  five  day  para  veterinarian  course  provided  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
<br/>immediately register with the Ministry to establish their clinics. Concurrently, the Ministry will be 
<br/>provided with an intensive six months qualifying course and training to register these graduates as 
<br/>full veterinary officers once they pass a qualifying exam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government will continue to support the agricultural sectors through our various public 
<br/>enterprises.  Government has allocated a capital grant of $323,150 to the Yaqara Pastoral Company 
<br/>Limited (YPCL).  The two-third contribution for the purchase of the new excavator that will allow 
<br/>the  company  to  construct  observation  points  in  the  mountainous  area  near  Yaqara  and  boundary 
<br/>fences to control the movement of livestock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Coconut Millers have been provided $420,750 to support its replanting programme and 
<br/>farm cleaning rehabilitation.  The new Farming Cleaning Initiative, FCML has identified 20 farmers 
<br/>with a combined land area of 50 acres to be assisted at a cost of $4,500 per acre.  It is expected that 
<br/>$245,000 will be used for this purpose and the remaining funds will be used for coconut replanting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Rice  Limited  has  been  allocated  $1.3  million  in  2022-2023  financial  year  with  the 
<br/>purchase of paddy from farmers.  This subsidy ensures that rice farmers will be paid upfront when 
<br/>supplying paddy to the rice mill at Dreketi in Vanualevu.

<div><span>The  Government  has  again  provided  $1.2  million  to  Food  Processors  Fiji  Limited  to 
<br/>undertake critical infrastructure upgrades for the factory, improve its farm in Batiri and subsidise the 
<br/>purchase of agricultural products from farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Government  commenced  the  ‘stronger  together  jobs  support  scheme’  to 
<br/>incentivise  employers  to  create  employment  for  out  of  work  Fijians.    To  date  $2.6  million  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  has  been  spent  to  help  85  employers  who  hired  2,453  Fijians.    Employers  assisted 
<br/>through  this  Initiative  include  pharmacies,  manufacturing  companies,  hotels,  construction  and 
<br/>security companies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2022-2023 $2 million have been budgeted to enable the employment of at least 1,500 out 
<br/>of work Fijians.  Applications for the Stronger Together Jobs Support Scheme are open to employers 
<br/>in the private sector, public enterprises, registered NGOs and municipal councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will also be amending the Illicit Drugs Control Act 2004 to pave the 
<br/>way for the establishment of the Industrial Hemp Export Industry in Fiji.  We have spoken about this 
<br/>in the past and we have taken the time to ensure that we get this right and we have been talking to 
<br/>the UN about this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industrial Hemp is a lucrative and largely untapped resource in the global economy due to 
<br/>misconception about what it really is.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Industrial Hemp is not the same thing as 
<br/>marijuana as we call it in Fiji.  It contains very low level of THC and would not make anyone high 
<br/>regardless of how much they consume. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the trick to getting this right is to ensure that we only import and cultivate Industrial 
<br/>Hemp with the THC level below one percent.  There are such amendments due to that effect. We will 
<br/>also amend the Customs Prohibited Import and Export Regulation 1986 to make Industrial Hemp a 
<br/>conditional import item in Schedule 2 for those regulations.  Industrial hemp will only be allowed 
<br/>into  the  country  for  the  purpose  of  cultivation  and  export  once  independent  laboratory  testing 
<br/>confirms that the THC content is below one percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be working closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to arrange for 
<br/>the FNU Agriculture School to grow these industrial hemp seeds.   Once we have those in hand we will 
<br/>be able to distribute these seeds to farmers whether in Kadavu or anywhere else in Fiji.  We plan to source 
<br/>these seeds, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from Canada which has very good high quality industrial hemp seeds which 
<br/>are some of the highest quality hemp in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rewa Dairy has had duty protection for ten years allowing it to grow into 
<br/>the company that it has become.  Mr. Speaker Sir, we thank the Southern Cross Foods that actually 
<br/>bought Rewa Dairy in those days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, now called Fiji Dairy large debt stocks.  They 
<br/>bought the debt stock out when they bought the company and Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of Rewa Dairy’s 
<br/>supply of milk and our dairy products were being imported then still is because the local demand 
<br/>exceeds far more the supply capacity for the local dairy industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course will come to an end on the 31</span><span>st</span><span> of August, 2022. The duty 
<br/>of course on these products they will enjoy which will reduce from 32 percent to five percent now 
<br/>on all those products after the expiry of the agreement on cheese, yogurt and liquid and powdered 
<br/>milk. The protections of course benefitted the company that was part of the deal and we thank them 
<br/>for the purchase and we thank them for bringing the industry to where they are today and I would 
<br/>like to, in this respect, actually recognise Sandeep for his momentous and indeed forward-thinking 
<br/>unfortunately he is not with us anymore, Mr. Sandeep Patel.  Overall, they should bring about the 
<br/>competition of the supplier of the dairy products and lower prices for ordinary Fijians.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to also finally assure cane growers that sufficient funds have 
<br/>been allocated to the Ministry of Sugar to ensure the guarantee cane price of $85 will continue in this 
<br/>financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the game plan developed for our recovery would have remained a plan if it 
<br/>were not for the Civil Service.  The effort and energy made it reality. We have never cut the salaries 
<br/>despite political pressure from our opponents and we have no plans ever to do so. That is a promise 
<br/>that they can believe.  We have some important changes, benefits and reforms announced this evening 
<br/>for civil servants, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Job Evaluation Civil Service Remuneration Guideline will be amended to expand the 
<br/>definition or scarce skills to facilitate the inclusion of the payment of retention allowance for skillsets 
<br/>that exist in competitive markets for higher performing staff. Work on this will be finalised as soon 
<br/>as subsequently announced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced in the revised Budget the suspension on the payment of Maritime Location 
<br/>Allowance was lifted while the review of the Rural Allowance was to be undertaken.  The review 
<br/>has since been completed from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022, Rural Allowance will be reinstated for eligible civil 
<br/></span><span>servants and standardised rates across Ministries and Departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>School based staff have always had alternative leave arrangements to the wider civil servants 
<br/>given they have always had alternative leave arrangements to the wider civil servants given the need 
<br/>for face to face contacting students and of course they had holidays during the school holidays. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 school-based teaching staff would be allowed three days of annual 
<br/>personal  leave  with  the  approval  of  the  Heads  of  Schools  and  not  Divisional  Education  Officers 
<br/>because they do have matters to attend to themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Work life balance is not a luxury it is a necessity.  Our civil servants are not only civil servants 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are wives and husbands.  They are mothers and fathers and they need quality time at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To align to International Best Practice the amount of annual leave that can be carried into a 
<br/>new  leave  year  within  a  valid  contract  period  will  raise  from  10  to  12  days  depending  on  the 
<br/>operational  context  of  the  Department  or  Ministry,  flexi  hours  may  be  considered  in  respective 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise the higher demand for our nurses  overseas  especially in  Australia and New 
<br/></span><span>Zealand  evidenced  by  their  high  turnover  experienced  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address this the Ministry of Health and Medical Services will work with the Fiji Nursing 
<br/>Council to identify additional specialised areas of nursing to allow the Ministry to  remunerate the 
<br/>specialisations accordingly. The payment of transport allowance will be prioritised for those in public 
<br/>health care nursing in rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nursing quarters will undergo stocktake with the intent to upgrade in the new financial year. 
<br/>The Ministry of Health and Medical Services will also review the position of Ward Assistants and 
<br/>engage additional Ward Assistants to provide support to nurses in hospitals and allow them to focus 
<br/>on actually patient care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Midwives have been a scarce skill in Fiji for some time.  We have taken steps to invest in 
<br/>higher salaries and increase training opportunities to ensure we have enough midwives in the country.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The nature of this work requires midwives to operate on call to assist birthing women after all you 
<br/>cannot predict exactly when your baby will be born. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, of course, many of us have children.  I have three of them, Prime Minister 
<br/>has many children and many grandchildren, all of us have children or grandchildren and we know 
<br/>this.  In order to compensate midwives for their unpredictable and often very late or early hours they 
<br/>are  required  to  serve.  We  are  introducing  a  call  back  allowance  which  essentially  compensates 
<br/>midwives for the additional hours they work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  do  not  forget  our  allied  health  workers.    The  payment  of  overtime  allowance  will  be 
<br/>extended  to  all  our  professionals  in  the  allied  health  cadre  on  Band  F.    These  include  dieticians, 
<br/>nutritionists,  environmental  health  officers,  physiotherapists,  medical  laboratory  technologists, 
<br/>medical  imaging  technologists,  pharmacists,  oral  health  officers,  dental  officers  and  biomedical 
<br/>engineers.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  teachers  also  deserve  greater  certainty  in  how  they  get  paid.    We 
<br/>acknowledge that the teacher remuneration arrangements have changed a number of times in the past 
<br/>five years which have led to inconsistencies in the ways they are remunerated.  Degree level teaching 
<br/></span><span>positions have been evaluated Band F, sooner to other positions across the Civil Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, 1,295 teachers have upgraded their qualifications to relevant undergraduate degree 
<br/>and move to Band F with an additional 121 applications expected to be processed.  From 1 August, 
<br/>2022, teachers who are eligible to be on Band F will transition to step 3 of Band F.  This will also 
<br/>apply to newer graduates with relevant qualifications.  This is to allow for some consistencies in the 
<br/>pay of teachers.  Teachers on Band D and E on shortage of contracts will be provided with 5 year 
<br/>contracts to allow them time to upgrade their qualifications so they can move up to higher bands and 
<br/>earn themselves a pay rise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is our duty to take the lead in building effective, accountable, inclusive institution at all 
<br/>levels.    To  begin  the  process,  several  years  ago  when  our  Government  prioritised  Open  Merit 
<br/>Recruitment System (OMRS) and implemented guidelines based on good government principles and 
<br/>that effort continues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  new  customer  service  guideline  was  approved  and  circulated  to  all  ministries  and 
<br/>departments earlier this month for implementation.  There are many specific ways and we are asking 
<br/>for a higher level of service the list of which requires that all civil servants refer to the people they 
<br/></span><span>serve as Mr, Ms, Mrs, Madam or Sir.  As part of the implementation, we launched a customer service 
<br/></span><span>feedback line; the 157 toll free number now allows anyone in Fiji to provide feedback or submit a 
<br/>complaint related to customer service they received at any government ministry or department and 
<br/>also  service  a  feedback  loop  that  will  contribute  to  the  performance,  assessments  of  staff  of  the 
<br/>respective Ministries and Departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The feedback received on the toll free number will form an announcement next year of the 
<br/>top five service to the ministries and departments.  We will not only tell the people where we are 
<br/>doing well in the interest of transparency and accountability, we will also be announcing the poorest 
<br/>performing  ministries  and  departments  as  it  relates  to  customer  service  so  that  the  people  know 
<br/>exactly where the Government will be focused on making improvements.  Civil Service wide training 
<br/>on improving customer service experience has begun and will be incorporated into your induction 
<br/>programmes and our online learning module and we will be available for all civil servants from junior 
<br/>levels to Deputy Secretaries.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another implementation of tool to measure success and ensure that the customer government 
<br/>feedback loop is working, a mystery shopper scenario will be implemented as a measurement tool.  
<br/>This will involve a small group of people visiting different ministries and departments anonymously 
<br/>to check out the quality of customer care services.  They will assess generally how well customers 
<br/>are treated and served by members of the civil service including how long people are left waiting, 
<br/>how thoroughly they assisted and how politely they are spoken to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once sufficient based on information collected and used to improve processes, we launch the 
<br/>Customer  Service  Awards  at  the  ministry  and  department  level  and  at  individual  level.    Using 
<br/>evidence-based assessment tools these awards will acknowledge the dedication and hard work that 
<br/>Civil Service put in to improve the service to the Fijian public.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to ensure 
<br/>that  the  civil  servants  not  only  serve  the  people,  but  make  the  most  effective  use  possible  of  the 
<br/>people’s resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next financial year Sir, the Ministry of Civil Service will lead a right sizing initiative 
<br/>across the Civil Service.  We will start by reviewing vacant positions in the selection of ministries in 
<br/>particular  long  standing  ones  and  departments  identify  positions  that  are  not  required.    These 
<br/>unnecessary positions that have not been filled for a long period of time will be relocated to ministries 
<br/></span><span>and departments with more urgent and pertinent staffing needs before the end of the second quarter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  works  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  to  fund  their 
<br/>relocation and right-sizing as it progresses.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this effort essentially ensures that the 
<br/>Civil Service will not become unnecessary bloated and remains as lean and as efficient as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly on the subject of civil service, we will be restoring the 10 percent pay cut we asked of 
<br/>all the Permanent Secretaries throughout the pandemic and any voluntary pay cuts taken by the heads 
<br/>of government-funded agencies from 1st August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course independent bodies too that voluntarily took a cut, they can have 
<br/>that  restored  and  even  backdated  depending  on  the  board  or  the  particular  commission.    The 
<br/>Ministers, Assistant Ministers, MPs will remain with the 25 percent reduced pay cut. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I will not detail every expenditure by each Ministry or Department in 
<br/>Government - that can be found in the Budget Supplement documents - I will review some important 
<br/>highlights.  Sir, number one and most importantly, we are stepping our funding to FICAC.  We have 
<br/>uprooted a culture of corruption that has plagued our society since independence.  Fiji today is one of the 
<br/></span><span>least  corrupt  countries  in  the  world  (do  not  laugh,  do  not  shake  your  head  when  you  do  not  know 
<br/></span><span>anything).  In the 2005 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) before this Government came into power, Fiji 
<br/>always scored 40 points out of 100 and ranked 55 out of 159 countries, placing us among the middle third 
<br/>of the nations. According to the report, that indicated serious levels of corruption within the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, CPI scored 55 points out of 100, ranked 45 out of the 180 countries for Fiji. Fiji came in 
<br/>to  the  top  third  of  the  countries  that  scored  above  50  points.  In  another  report  the  global  corruption 
<br/>barometer Pacific Report 2021, the corruption and electoral process were amongst the key focus areas, 
<br/>and Fiji was found to run one of the cleanest electoral processes in the Pacific. That is our record and it 
<br/>is backed by credible and impartial analysis – not by those on social media, those who crow about Fiji 
<br/>becoming a more corrupt country under our leadership are those who are the most corrupt of all.  Their 
<br/>actions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, speak louder than their politically motivated whingeing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two  Opposition  parliamentarians  were  recently  convicted  of  obtaining  financial  advantage 
<br/>through fraudulent conduct.  These people broke the law and they were found guilty in a court of law. 
<br/>Did the Opposition or the political opponents condemn their actions? No, in fact they released statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<div><span>2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1477 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>praising them.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the ugly face of the deep-seeded culture of corruption that remains 
<br/>in Fiji, a culture that prioritises certain personalities over the rule of law; a culture that sees some people 
<br/>as untouchable, above the rest of us and even above justice; a culture that lurks beneath the surface of a 
<br/>just society waiting to rewrite the rules in its favour.  If they could even be bothered to pretend to care 
<br/>about democracy and the rule of law, the Opposition and those political opponents outside should have 
<br/>condemned the corruption of its members the minute they were found guilty in an independent court of 
<br/>law.  Instead they try to make them out as martyrs, that has become the standard response - no matter 
<br/>how serious the claim, no matter how provable the charges, they do worse than tolerate corruption. They 
<br/>make heroes out of their worst offenders.  That should serve as a warning to everyone about what they 
<br/>would do if they ever assume power, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the only thing worse than corrupt individuals are their appeasers - those 
<br/>who stand by and let it happen, so as long as this culture remains, our commitment to root it out will keep 
<br/>ramping up.  This Budget funds a national level strategy to strengthen the fight against corruption in Fiji.  
<br/>FICAC has already started the process of creating the necessary framework with the assistance of the 
<br/>United Nation Development Programme and United Nation’s Office on Drugs and Crime.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2022-2023 Budget, the Land Transport Authority will be allocated a total 
<br/></span><span>of $22.4 million - $800,000 specifically for the implementation of new integrated information technology 
<br/></span><span>which would enable customers to access more services online, one more step towards the transformation 
<br/>under digitalFIJI.  To assist in the payment of loading another fine, the Land Transport Authority will 
<br/>allow individual companies to pursue those who had been fined previously (not the new ones), to pursue 
<br/>a payment plan option in line with strict conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon payment of the first instalment, normal transactions will be allowed and the vehicles will 
<br/>be released from any freeze on transaction.  This will allow individuals or companies to continue using  
<br/>vehicles for their business purpose and still meet their fine repayment.  If they default, they will lose the 
<br/>entire thing.  To be clear, of course, as I said this is only for past infractions - this is not the policy moving 
<br/>forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  order  to  better  monitor  and  protect  our  Fijian  roads,  there  will  be  restrictions  placed  on 
<br/>commercial vehicles moving into residential areas.  The municipality and the Fiji Roads Authority in 
<br/>collaboration with LTA will determine the gross combined mass and dimension allowed for commercial 
<br/>vehicles entering residential areas. This is less about preventing disruption but these roads simply cannot 
<br/>handle the stress for such heavy vehicles.  We find people (just for lunch) taking their overladen trucks 
<br/>into small streets and they completely damage the roads.  The regulations are being amended and will 
<br/></span><span>come into effect from 1st August, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2022-2023 Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Maritime Safety Authority Fiji (MSAF) will be 
<br/>allocated  a  total  of  $7.4  million,  of  which  $5.9  million  is  for  operations,  $1.5  million  for  capital 
<br/>expenditure,  $1.1  million  is  allocated  to  reconstruct  the  damaged  lighthouse  at  the  Suva  Harbour 
<br/>Northeast, Pinder Reef and Beqa Southwest Reef.  In order to meet the standards of the International 
<br/>Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) and keep our coastline 
<br/>safe for vessels, the Authority put forward a proposal of salary increments due to current impediments 
<br/>affecting the organisation’s operations and deliverables.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Authority has suffered operational losses as a result of lack of human resources in various 
<br/>departments,  high  attrition  of  senior  officers  and  management,  which  is  a  direct  result  of  lower 
<br/>remuneration, insufficient resources and lack of funding for specific activities.  Through the 2022-2023 
<br/>Budget, a 10 percent increment for 51 technical staff, amounting to $183,000 has been agreed to and 
<br/>provided.  The remaining 10 percent to meet the 120 percent median quartile is to be implemented in 
<br/>2023-2024 financial year.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has approved a total budget of $211,000 for 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>five individuals to be selected by the Authority to undertake the full two and half year course until they 
<br/>reach the Class III certification.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Republic of Fiji Military Forces has a total budget for 2022-2023 financial year is $94.1 
<br/>million.  This is an increase of $8 million from the Revised 2021-2022 Budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $5 
<br/>million is allocated to correctly align the Lodging Allowance and Service Allowance to the current basic 
<br/>salary of 2,396 RFMF officers.  At the moment, these officers, unfortunately, are being paid allowances 
<br/>based on the 2013 Basic Pay, so it is essential to realign this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $400,000 is also provided for the remote location allowance for the engineers 
<br/>who are engaged to build and maintain rural projects, such as Rotuma Hospital, Kadavu Foot Bridge, 
<br/>Lakeba Suspension Bridge and Bua Lomanikoro Foot Bridge; $2.3 million is allocated for the renovation 
<br/>and upgrade works at RFMF facilities including renovation upgrade of RFMF infrastructure, construction 
<br/>of new warehouse at QEB, upgrade of logistics support unit complex, upgrade of Sukunaivalu Barracks 
<br/>in Labasa and the upgrade of Nadi Camp. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are allocating a total of $50.8 million for Peacekeeping Operations, which is an increase of 
<br/>$5.5 million from the Revised 2021-2022 Budget.  The officers deployed for peacekeeping operations 
<br/></span><span>were also paid allowances based on their 2013 Basic Pay rate; $800,000 is provided to realign the Lodging 
<br/></span><span>and Service Allowances for 543 peacekeeping officers on the current pay; $3.5 million has been allocated 
<br/>to meet salaries and allowances of the peacekeeping officers as aligned to the payroll.  Additionally, $3 
<br/>million has been allocated for military training and equipment, which will be reimbursed by the United 
<br/>Nations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General is allocated $5.8 million in the 2022-2023 Budget.  This is an 
<br/>increase of  $900,000  or  $0.9 million as  compared to  the Revised 2021-2022  Budget;  $650,000 is  to 
<br/>address the backlog of audits.  The Office is planning to engage major auditing firms to complete 99 
<br/>pending audits languishing with the OAG outlined for the 2022-2023 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament is allocated $8.6 million in the 2022-2023 Budget.  This is an increase of $1.5 million 
<br/>as compared to the Revised 2021-2022 Budget to cover the operational costs of political offices and the 
<br/>addition of four seats to 55 from the current number of 51 Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Prime Minister is allocated $16.9 million in 2022-2023 Budget, an increase of 
<br/>$2.1 million from the Revised Budget of 2021-2022.   The major increase includes an additional $2.9 
<br/>million provided to the Department of Immigration.  As you know, the Department of Immigration falls 
<br/></span><span>under the Prime Minister’s Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1.3 is allocated to procure e-passport booklets to improve the security of Fiji’s 
<br/>passports.  With the opening of our borders, the Department expects to issue 300 passport booklets per 
<br/>day to meet demand and expects to exhaust its supply of 42,000 booklets in the next six months.  The e-
<br/>passport system is up and running and to ensure its effectiveness and continuity without any disruption, 
<br/>the Department is also allocated $2 million to undertake the disaster recovery for e-passport project.  The 
<br/>project will reduce the damage or disruption to the system and allow quick recovery in the event of a 
<br/>disaster that leads to the system failure.  It will also act as a backup system to protect the data in the e-
<br/>passport.    This  ensures  that  Fijian  passports  will  get  more  readily  accepted  in  other  countries  and 
<br/>hopefully give our Fijian people access to more of what we call “visa on arrival”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Police Force is allocated $182.6 million, a slight reduction of $3.2 
<br/>million from the Revised 2021-2022 Budget, resulting from the near completion of three new police 
<br/>stations - that is why the capital expenditure has come down, in Nadi, Nakasi and Lautoka.  Those three 
<br/>stations  plus  the  new  station  in  Nalawa  will  be  allocated  a  total  budget  provision  of  $10  million,  a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1479 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reduction of $14.5 million.  This will expand the reach of police protection for Fijians living in the Central 
<br/>and Western Divisions.  Crime is changing of course and our policing must change with it.  The Force is 
<br/>increasingly focused on preventing cybercrimes and combatting drug trafficking.  In order to reform itself 
<br/>to  better  address  these  emerging  threats,  the  Force  is  undergoing  a  major  reform  and  restructure 
<br/>programme first announced in 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Force will now continue with phase three of the five-year reform and restructure programme 
<br/>which  was  endorsed  by  Cabinet  in  2018.    The  programme  was  halted  for  the  past  two  years  due  to 
<br/>COVID-19 and after, phases one and two were completed at a cost of $68.3 million.  The Force will 
<br/>commend  phase three of  the RNR  with the  government providing an additional  $4.2  million  for the 
<br/>recruitment of 331 new positions.  This includes 289 new recruits, 15 promotions, seven new civilian 
<br/>positions and 20 new government wage earners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure that Fiji Police Force is fully equipped to provide the best possible service, government 
<br/>will also be providing $4.9 million for the procurement of uniforms, uniform accessories, clothing and 
<br/>footwear.  After some years of focus on constructing new police stations, we are now shifting our focus 
<br/>to improving the condition of the police quarters and posts with an initial allocation of $1.5 million.  The 
<br/>Force is also allocated $1.2 million under Head 50 to assist the Fijian Elections Office to conduct the 
<br/></span><span>2022 or 2023 General Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make Fiji more competitive with other tourist holiday destinations, we are 
<br/>amending the Superyacht Act and reducing the charter fee from US$55,000 to US$30,000.  We are also 
<br/>amending the definition of superyachts from the minimum length of 24 metres to 18 metres which will 
<br/>mean more super yachts chartering in Fijian waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Forestry has been allocated an increased budget of $17.7 million of which $3.3 
<br/>million will be used to facilitate the large-scale planting of trees to continue with Fiji’s 30 Million Trees 
<br/>in 15 Years Initiative.  Since its inception in 2019, Fiji has put over 12 million new trees in the ground 
<br/>through this commitment.  The allocated budget will provide technical support in terms of seed sourcing, 
<br/>seed supply, nursery and silviculture practice training and direct incentives for landowners to establish 
<br/>and manage their own forests.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with this objective, $500,000 has been allocated for research into developing new forest 
<br/>products that can increase economic opportunities for resource owners, cottage industries in the sector.  
<br/>This  funding  will  support  in-depth  studies,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  identified  tree  species,  trial  tests, 
<br/>specialised  equipment,  as  well  as  collaboration  and  consultation.    This  is  part  of  the  diversification 
<br/></span><span>programme for the forestry sector.  The Maritime Pine Development Project is intended to provide a 
<br/></span><span>return on investment for pine grown decades ago in the maritime islands.  Government has allocated 
<br/>$700,000  to  assist  resource  owners  through  the  provision  of  appropriate  harvesting  machines  and 
<br/>equipment with the capacity to economically harvest, process and market their pine trees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  specifically,  resource  owners  will  be  able  to  use  their  own  timber  to  build 
<br/>cyclone resilient homes and market the surplus to generate revenue and elevate the standard of living.  
<br/>Fiji of course is committed to the global objective of reducing carbon emissions and enabling carbon 
<br/>trades with protection of the extensive forest resources.  The Ministry of Forestry will receive $350,000, 
<br/>Sir, to complete the National Forest Inventory which is an accounting of Fiji’s forest resources and an 
<br/>essential reference for decision-making on the sustainable management of our forests including carbon 
<br/>trading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable fisheries are in our fixture of our vision to a bluer Fijian economy.  We are steadily 
<br/>introducing sustainable harvesting regimes to manage the health of vulnerable marine species in Fiji.  We 
<br/>have lifted the five-year ban on </span><span>beche-de-me</span><span>r in favour of a set of harvesting window.  As we explore 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>managed harvesting of other species, we are simultaneously strengthening the science behind culturing 
<br/>these and other high-valued species to support sustainable economic sources for coastal communities.  
<br/>The businesses involved in both domestic and export sales, and to our national economy.  Specifically, 
<br/>Sir, the sustainable measures for the </span><span>beche-de-mer</span><span> fishery include allowing only the customary fishing 
<br/>rights owners to be licenced to harvest.  Implementing a fair and transparent process for the selection of 
<br/>traders and exporters, allowing only the non-convention on international trade of endangered species 
<br/>listed species to be harvested, setting size limits and limiting the harvesting and trading periods to only 
<br/>two and four months respectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Jobs for Nature 2.0 is one of the several initiatives that Government is backing in the area of green 
<br/>jobs.  Jobs for Nature 2.0 gives approximately 10,000 Fijians the chance to generate an income while at 
<br/>the same time contributing to mitigating climate change impacts. The project  is  expected to  pay the 
<br/>minimum wage rate to the public, participants who will have the opportunity for short term work on 
<br/>wetlands  protection  such  as  mangroves  and  seagrass  planting,  restoring  waterways,  riverbank 
<br/>rehabilitation and coastal bank protection, including vetiver grass, enhancing biodiversity through 
<br/>forest restoration, native tree planting, coral reef protection and planting indigenous fruit trees, et 
<br/>cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  will  also  be  employment  opportunities  in  waste  and  wastewater  management.    The 
<br/></span><span>Government will also with the concessional funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the World Bank will 
<br/>provide  $7.6  million  to  back  the  initiative  which  involves  a  variety  of  stakeholders  including  the 
<br/>respective ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly to run through ways we are making businesses easy in Fiji as 
<br/>we prepare for private sector leverage stage  growth, we are leaving no stones unturned to  ensure 
<br/>certainty for the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise that immigration laws and processes need to be continually updated to enable 
<br/>us to keep pace with the rapidly evolving world.  We need fast and simple mechanisms that allow us 
<br/>to remain competitive in the investment destination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To assist with ease of getting specialised expatriates for short-term work assignments or those 
<br/>who want to come and visit businesses and provide consultation services, effective from 1st August, 
<br/>2022 business visas will be granted on arrival for citizens of certain countries that have visa free entry 
<br/>to Fiji.  We will start with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and United States of America.  The 
<br/>business visa on arrival will be valid for 21 days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  also  modernising  aspects  of  the  immigration  system  to  better  recognise  COVID 
<br/>requirements  for  entry  and  removal  of  red-tapes  and  additional  processes  regarding  permit 
<br/>processing.  Permit conditions will now also apply to persons in </span><span>de facto</span><span> relationships with them as 
<br/>well as parents and guardians of family members.  We are lowering the age of a child for immigration 
<br/>purposes from 21 years to 18 years. We are also looking at introducing new categories of permits 
<br/>and revising the fee structure as charged by the department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past five years, we stripped away unnecessary requirements and fees for business 
<br/>registration,  fast  tracked  approvals  and  increased  the  validity  of  licences,  saving  businesses 
<br/>immeasurable  time  and  at  least  $3.5  million  in  direct  savings  according  to  the  World  Bank.  The 
<br/>bizFIJI  portal  contains  a  simple  and  consolidated  guide  on  how  to  start  a  business  and  obtain 
<br/>construction permits.  Now, we have an important update, Project bizFIJI 2.0 which is led by the 
<br/>Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Tourism and Transport, $9 million 
<br/>has been allocated for the implementation of a centralised online application and approval system for 
<br/>starting a business and obtaining construction permits process.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the next 22 months, Sir, we will see the rollout of 25 digital services across 16 different 
<br/>agencies.    To  ensure  seamless  online  transition  for  the  construction  permit  acquisition  processes, 
<br/>amendments will be embed with the requirements for qualified persons into the Town and Planning 
<br/>Subdivision Legislation for the first time.  Qualified persons such as engineers, architects, surveyors, 
<br/>et cetera will be clearly identified and referenced in law to assist in the streamlining of the registration 
<br/>process.  This will lead to improvement in the quality of service delivery plus increase accountability 
<br/>and responsibility of those involved in the construction industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Forestry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has implemented online licencing for the export 
<br/>and import of timber and forest  products  which  has  reduced turnaround time within 24 hours for 
<br/>approvals. The online application for logging licence has now enabled licences to be issued within 
<br/>48 hours.  This Budget will continue to support the Ministry’s ongoing digitalisation transition in 
<br/>support of the sustainable management of our forest resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Insurance agents used to apply annually for licences, those agents can now apply for licences 
<br/>for a maximum period of five years.  This will be amended through this Budget.  The same will go 
<br/>for sand and gravel extraction licences.  The terms of fishing licences will now be aligned to those 
<br/>legally allowed for fishing permits which is up to three years upon approval of the customary </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/></span><span>fishing rights owners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We announced our working group with iTLTB, the Ministry of Lands, Department of Town 
<br/>and Country Planning and the Ministry of Economy in the mini-budget or the revised budget to work 
<br/>on improving survey processes. The agencies were provided with additional resources and they have 
<br/>been  working  diligently  in  clearing  backlogs  and  reducing  inefficient  internal  processes.    As 
<br/>previously indicated on  1st  August,  2022, all new surveys of  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land can be tracked online. 
<br/>Furthermore, all members of the public from 1st August, 2022 will have free access to the VanuaGIS 
<br/>system  for  all  users;  no  fee.    Anyone  can  go  and  check  the  VanuaGIS,  making  this  invaluable 
<br/>information more accessible to the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands will also enable chartered approved survey plans to be viewed online 
<br/>via the Vanua View platform and scanned plans will be freely available on the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>website.  This  expands  access  to  information  that  is  good  for  investment,  good  for  sustainable 
<br/>development and indeed democratises information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Roads infrastructure has been the most costly part of developing rural lots and subdivisions 
<br/>and land development costs to meet subdivision design and standard requirements have become a 
<br/></span><span>stumbling  block  for  development,  especially  for  ordinary  Fijians  living  in  the  rural  areas.    In 
<br/></span><span>consultation  with  the  Inter-Agency  Working  Group  (IAWG),  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  will  soon 
<br/>finalise specific standards for rural subdivisions, thereby reducing cost in allowing more Fijians to 
<br/>acquire land for housing purposes in deep rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The financial limit for obtaining tax clearances will be raised from $5,000 to $10,000. It was 
<br/>raised from $2,500 to $5,000 and now it has gone up to $10,000. This excludes payment for services. 
<br/>This move will benefit banks, businesses and individuals as it significantly reduces the number of 
<br/>small transactions requiring clearance.  Blanket tax clearances are also easily available for larger and 
<br/>more regular transactions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  will  increase  the  FNPF  employer  and  employee 
<br/>contribution from 6.0 percent to 7.0 percent from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023 through 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023. For 
<br/>more than a year now, FNPF members’ accounts have received contributions at a lower rate.  This 
<br/>1.0  percent  reversal  for  both  employers  and  employees  should  credit  $40  million  to  members’ 
<br/>accounts.  The Government will gradually revert the contribution rates to a total of 18 percent in the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coming  years.    Any  employer  who  chooses  to  contribute  more  than  the  7.0  percent  statutory 
<br/>mandatory  contribution  up  to  10  percent  will  be  allowed  to  deduct  300  percent  of  the  employer 
<br/>additional contribution from their taxes and that additional income in the pocket of the employee will 
<br/>be exempt from income tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  support  female  entrepreneurs  in  MSMEs,  we  are  providing  $1  million  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank Women Entrepreneurs Loan Package. The Women Entrepreneurs Loan Package 
<br/>will target women entrepreneurs with registered businesses in operation who require working capital 
<br/>or need to expand their existing business. The package will allow a minimum loan of $1,000 to a 
<br/>maximum of $5,000 with a loan term of up to three years which will be available to sole traders, joint 
<br/>ventures and partnership businesses on its own or those that provide services to other industries. The 
<br/>10 percent equity required for loan packages will be provided through this $1 million allocation will 
<br/>greatly support female entrepreneurs’ access to financing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is an important opportunity to enact policy. It is not the only 
<br/>opportunity.  Our ears are as open to businesses of all size; micro, small, medium and large as they 
<br/>always  are  and  will  remain  flexible  to  develop  joint  solutions  to  every  serious  and  unforeseen 
<br/>challenge facing our recovery.  We will certainly be introducing other legal procedural changes to 
<br/></span><span>create most efficient and least bureaucratic environment possible for our businesses to thrive and also 
<br/></span><span>our individual citizens to enjoy.  Our golden rule will be that every process must serve a purpose 
<br/>other than simply creating a bureaucratic role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not played around with taxes through the pandemic and we will 
<br/>not play around with it in this Budget either. We only making two tax changes in this Budget.  One 
<br/>for  motor  vehicles  and  one  to  realign  the  corporate  tax  rate  for  international  headquarters  and 
<br/>companies listed in the stock exchange.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are keeping our regime lean, mean, streamlined and focussed on making Fiji the region’s 
<br/>most comparative investment and business destination, not for one year but over a multi-year period.  
<br/>There will be no changes to the taxes that were removed such as ECAL, STT, Stamp Duty, Departure 
<br/>Tax, the removal of 20 cents fuel levy, the VAT zero-rated items and large scale reduction in custom 
<br/>duty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Combined these tax cuts will save Fijians around $600 million per year.  These are promised 
<br/>to the private sector that these taxes remain at these low rates or lower for the next three years at 
<br/>least. That is our bond to you because you are must hire, invest and drive this economy.  What we 
<br/></span><span>ask in return is that you pass these savings on to customers including our visitors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know the price of wheat is rising but there is no need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be charging $12 
<br/>for a stubby anywhere in Fiji and some hotels have already started doing that.  We need to take a 
<br/>long term approach to sustain profits rather than squeeze people for everything they are worth once 
<br/>they are at our shores.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Employment Taxation System currently set to expire in 2023 will now be extended until 
<br/>31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2024. The Scheme provides that 300 percent tax deduction on the amount of any 
<br/>salaries or wages paid to first time employees.  If I am a graduate and someone employs me for the 
<br/>first time, they get a 300 percent tax deduction with the wages that is paid to me.  A 300 percent tax 
<br/>deduction of the amount of any salary or wages paid to a student for employment before the student’s 
<br/>graduation.  So, during my university holidays, if I go and work for a company, the salary they pay 
<br/>to me, that company can claim a 300 percent tax deduction.  Where the employment forms part of 
<br/>the student’s course requirements of a higher education, a 300 percent tax deduction of the amount 
<br/>of salary and wages paid to the student by the employer, is also eligible for that deduction.  So if I

<div><span>2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am required to do part-time work whilst I am studying, as part of my course again, whoever pays me 
<br/>that can claim 300 percent tax deduction and a 400 percent tax deduction or amount of any salary or 
<br/>wages to a person with disability for a consecutive period of three years. If you employ someone 
<br/>with disability, you get a 400 percent tax deduction, it used to be 300 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a 300 percent tax deduction will also be extended for wages and salaries 
<br/>paid to persons for apprenticeship. If you hire someone as an apprentice, the salary paid to them, you 
<br/>can claim 300 percent from us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The corporate tax rate applicable to companies relocating their global or regional head office 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be increased from 17 percent to 20 percent and this will be effective from tax year 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 10 percent reduced rate of corporate tax available to companies listed on the South Pacific 
<br/>Stock Exchange will only be available for seven years.  Companies that have enjoyed the reduced 
<br/>rate for seven years or more will now pay the corporate tax rate at 20 percent in the new financial 
<br/>year.  Our commitment is to prevent taxes from becoming a burden on businesses, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>That said, a smart tax regime relies on incentives to drive business and consumer behaviour.  We are 
<br/>making moves to become a less carbon reliant and more energy secure society.  That will not happen 
<br/></span><span>overnight, but those steps cannot wait.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  will  be  enhancing  the  electric  vehicles  charging  incentive  with  a  lower  minimum 
<br/>investment threshold of $50,000 from $100,000.  The subsidy will be increased from 5 percent to 10 
<br/>percent on capital expenditure incurred in the development of electric vehicle charging stations.  It 
<br/>includes even individuals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will zero rate VAT and duty on all electric vehicles and allow accelerated depreciation of 
<br/>100 percent in the first year.  Individuals and businesses that purchase electric motor vehicles will 
<br/>also  receive  a  $10,000  cash  payment  from  Government  towards  the  purchase  of  that  vehicle.  
<br/>Additionally Mr. Speaker, Sir, companies as I said will enjoy a 100 percent accelerated depreciation.  
<br/>We will also increase the import duty on passenger cars to $1,000 for second hand passenger cars, 
<br/>import duty on new passenger cars will be increased by 5 percent.  These are modest sums.  We will 
<br/>also be introducing a luxury vehicle tax of $10,000 per vehicle for vehicles over 3000cc.  A five-year 
<br/>age  limit  will  be  imposed  on  the  importation  of  second  hand  petrol  and  diesel  powered  motor 
<br/>vehicles.  This will align with the current five-year age limit on high breed vehicles.  The Euro 4 
<br/>compliance requirement continues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To help provide alternatives, diesel generators in rural and remote communities and support 
<br/></span><span>the rural electrification programme, the duty on Liquefied Petroleum Gas or LPG will be reduced 
<br/>from 4 cents per kilogramme to 2 cents per kilogramme.  The reduced duty will be applicable on 
<br/>LPG, supply for  energy  generation and  auto  gas  only.   This  will be administered as a drawback 
<br/>facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Effective from 1st January, 2023, capital gains exemption on gains made by a person with 
<br/>disposal of shares will be limited to resident individuals and Fijian citizens only.  Capital Gains Tax 
<br/>(CGT) will be exempted or repurchased agreements or what we call “repo transactions” administered 
<br/>by the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  Extension of project completion time provisions will be incorporated 
<br/>under the standard allowance incentive.  The residential housing and development incentive package 
<br/>will be further incentivised as follows.  Another tier of incentive will be available with the minimum 
<br/>investment requirement of $5 million with at least 10 residential lots.  There will be no condition on 
<br/>the sale of price and the investor will qualify for 50 percent developer profit exemption.  Moreover, 
<br/>they will enjoy customs concessions such as zero duty on the importation of capital goods including 
<br/>capital equipment, plant and machinery and other goods.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have one last amendment.  The 150 percent tax deduction available to 
<br/>restaurants, taverns, hotels and resorts that hire local artists such as craftsmen, dancers, musicians, 
<br/>people who perform </span><span>meke</span><span> will be increased from a 150 percent to 300 percent.  We want the hotels 
<br/>to hire the people from the villages to come and do </span><span>meke</span><span>.  If they pay them a $1,000 they can claim 
<br/>$3,000 from us, if they hire the local band (do not have techno music), hire the local dance groups in 
<br/>the restaurants and resorts, they can claim 300 percent from us from whatever they pay them because 
<br/>we want our talent not only to be showcased and to be shown, but we do not want it to die off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we first announced this policy in 2020-2021 Budget during the period when our borders 
<br/>were closed, we had mentioned that the song, “</span><span>Gimme Hope Jo’anna” </span><span>was a theme song for our 
<br/>present situation and future recovery.  I hope in the next financial year, we can hear some renditions 
<br/>of “</span><span>I Will Survive” </span><span>by the great Gloria Gaynor.  Because we have survived my friends, our economy 
<br/>is no longer chained up by pandemic restriction and now we will thrive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the darkest and most uncertain days, you ask us what comes back, what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comes next.  And we answered by locking in this course for a comeback.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of our honourable Prime Minister who led it, the civil servants 
<br/></span><span>who supported it and the Fijians who depended on its success, I am proud to say that our national 
<br/></span><span>recovery  is  the  most  important  promise  we  have  ever  kept.    This  is  not  a  crisis  budget,  it  is  a 
<br/>confidence budget because that is what Fiji needs in this moment, neither it is an election Budget.  
<br/>This Government does not need one because we have strong record of recovery and we are proud to run 
<br/>on. We have taken the economy from the depth of its worst crisis to its greatest year ever of record. The 
<br/>COVID-19 put us in the situation, we took ourselves out of it.  This Budget is compassionate, it is sensible, 
<br/>it  is  disciplined,  it  is  the  Budget  that  the  nation  needs,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  our  people  need,  our 
<br/>businesses need and there are recovery needs to sustain itself for years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inflation is rising, Sir, this Budget mitigates it, especially for those most vulnerable. Our economy 
<br/>is surging, this Budget strengthens it.  Our jobs are increasing, this Budget adds to them.  Climate events 
<br/>are becoming more devastating, this Budget strengthens our infrastructure.  We are realistic about the 
<br/>threats we face, ambitious for our country and our children and optimistic about what can be achieved.  
<br/>This Budget answers the same question we have always asked with honest and vision, what is to come?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  to  that  great  question  of  our  aspiration  as  a  people,  your  Government  is  answer  is 
<br/>unambiguous - only the best is yet to come, Sir, and I wholeheartedly recommend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this 
<br/>Blue Print and this Budget that will guide us in the years to come. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
