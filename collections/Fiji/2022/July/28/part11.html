<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 31 – Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- I seek clarification on Programme 2-1-7 on   Feasibility  Study  –  Compliance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Enforcement ($180,000).  What does that entail? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- That is basically an allocation for our Compliance Unit 
<br/>that actually go out and investigate complaints on the ground.  If there are any issues, they will raise it 
<br/>with the Public Prosecutions for prosecutions or otherwise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, the Programme is implemented by the Inshore 
<br/>Compliance  and  Enforcement Division to  ensure  enforcement of relevant laws  and  legislation in the 
<br/>Inshore Sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Enforcement Unit is to address and monitor illegal and unregulated fishing practices.  Over
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1801 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the last three  years, the Unit has undertaken 2,118 land-based inspections, 160 sea-based inspections 
<br/>which has led to the prosecution of 79 cases, mainly inshore fisheries including poaching from Marine 
<br/>Protected Areas (MPAs), illegal fishing, harvesting and use of fishing gear where it is not allowed, et 
<br/>cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  benefit,  of  course,  is  to  allow  the  Ministry  to  make  constant  checks  and  gap  analysis  to 
<br/>continuously strengthen and improve the compliance and enforcement work within Fiji’s inshore and 
<br/>coastal fisheries.  There is also going to be a review of the SOPs and proposed policy and legislative 
<br/>amendments for the deterrence of illegal, unreported fishing.  That is what it is for, they are increasing 
<br/>their compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to seek a clarification on Programme 2-2-7 - 
<br/>Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) ($550,000).  This has been ongoing in several Budget Addresses.  
<br/>Has the Ministry been able to work with the industry to determine the catch lost by operators?  How is 
<br/>the industry willing to counter this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  basically  transitioning  into 
<br/>electronic platform and it also involves marine stewardship certification to support fishing vessels in order 
<br/></span><span>to meet international standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Are you able to determine the loss of catch by operators through this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>monitoring? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Absolutely.  We have two layers of monitoring, one is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>electronic monitoring and then we also have our observers on board ships. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-3-1 - Personal Emoluments ($471,614),  
<br/>I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That we raise Personal Emoluments by $400,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fact  is  that,  we  need  scientists  to  come  and  do  research  and  development  on  this.    Our 
<br/>contribution to GDP has been low all these years.  We need scientific brains to come in and do research 
<br/>and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, he has already answered what he is asking. 
<br/>It  is  basically  to  cater  for  additional  persons’  FNPF  -  the  Data  Collectors,  Compliance  Officers  and 
<br/>Officers who carry out monitoring, as well as their meal and accommodation allowances which he had 
<br/>earlier asked.  Those are all catered for under Personnel Emoluments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, I need to move a motion to raise … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, you complain about </span><span>dinau</span><span>, et cetera, and then you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>want to raise it. Where do you get the money from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I need a seconder. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, if you want to raise a motion, say you want to raise a motion.  Do not go 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>round and round.  You have the floor, if you want to raise a motion.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion that we raise SEG 1 to $400,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I have said this earlier and I will repeat - the Ministry’s contribution to 
<br/>GDP has been a minus contribution.  We need scientific brains to come in.  Even though there is about 
<br/>$471,614, I think we need more scientific brains from outside because we have about 1.2 million square 
<br/>kilometres of open sea and we also have thousands of square kilometres of land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You work it out, you are not proposing it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, he is just plucking figures out of thin air.  
<br/>He should tell me what he wants the increase for.  I have already explained that the increase that has been 
<br/>done is to strengthen the monitoring of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing practices.  The 
<br/>Ministry has to ensure that resources are available to facilitate logistics and others, to cater for meals and 
<br/>accommodation, to enable the Ministry to meet increases in fuel price and overtime. These have already 
<br/></span><span>been catered for. He personally complained about </span><span>dinau</span><span> and he is asking us to increase. Where did he 
<br/></span><span>pluck the money from? I do not understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, fisheries is a natural resource-based sector.  All the sectors 
<br/>like agriculture, mining, gravel, et cetera, are all minor contributors to GDP.  I think we should concentrate 
<br/>on those natural-based sectors and fisheries is one. We have about 1.2 million square kilometres of sea 
<br/>and I think we should concentrate on that.  We have failed all these years and that is why we need good 
<br/>brains to come.  That is your job, honourable Minister, you have been lacking on the job.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I am seeking a clarification on Programme 2-3-8 
<br/>– Fisheries Stations Access, I note that there is an increase of $151,000 in the budgetary allocation 
<br/>from $927,000 to $1.078 million.  Can we get a clarification on that allocation, Mr. Chairman? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, this is to deal with the issues of our 
<br/>outlying island fisheries stations and also the new ones that have been done in Bua, Vanua Levu.  
<br/>There are isolated stations that have been opened and this is to deal with their access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, just a clarification from the honourable Minister on  
<br/>Programme 2-3-1 - Personal Emoluments ($471,614). One of the issues raised in a report submitted 
<br/>back to Parliament from the Standing Committee on Natural Resources is regularising positions and 
<br/>wages for people working in the Fisheries Research Unit and that is for the one at Galoa.  Has that 
<br/>been accommodated in this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I am not sure of the details that he is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>asking now, but I can come back to him if those positions have been regularised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-5-9 - Purchase of Aluminium Boat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Eastern Division ($300,000).  I see that that is a new item.  Can we have some clarification on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1803 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I do not know how to define it any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>further but aluminium boat is an aluminium boat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- What I am asking, Mr. Chairman, is that the boat for the Eastern 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Division, what islands will it service and what will it do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, basically when I made my speech, I 
<br/>had said that Eastern Division is purchasing a new aluminium boat basically to cover the Lau Group, 
<br/>and that is the requirement.  The Eastern Division will buy another aluminium boat to actually go to 
<br/>the islands in  Lau. I had covered it very well during my speech, so if he was listening I think he 
<br/>would have remembered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Is it vote buying exercise?  That is what I can see in terms of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a lot of allocations, even with the Ministry of Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Shoosh!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Seriously? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, I am serious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-5-8 – Preparatory Works for 
<br/>Ice Plants (Wainigadru and Koro), just a point of clarification from the honourable Minister, I think 
<br/>this allocation was budgeted also in the 2021-2022 allocation.  Can he give us an update, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, the preparatory  work takes a lot of 
<br/>time, it deals with land issues, if water is available and all other issues.  Of course, the opening of a 
<br/>station will mean that an ice plant will be opened there.  So there is a lot of work that is required to 
<br/>be done on the ground before the station itself is approved.  You have land issues and that is why it 
<br/>takes time.  It is in the process before it is actually being built. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-    Mr.  Chairman,  I  feel  compelled  to  make  a  response  to 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad.  Like him and his other two stooges from NFP, they constantly make 
<br/>crass, flippant comments.  He is saying that it is vote buying, what a stupid comment to make!    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  If  you  look  at  Capital  Purchase,  Sir,  even  if  one  were  to 
<br/>believe his fanciful theory, vote buying means that you give someone personally and say to them, “I 
<br/>am giving you this and you vote for me.”  This allocation, Sir, is the boat being given to the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries to do their work - to support the Fisheries Extension Service in the Eastern Division.  This 
<br/>will  provide  effective  service  delivery  to  the  extension  advisory,  research,  monitoring  of  illegal 
<br/>fishing, control  and surveillance work programme.  How is that in anyone’s fanciful idea of vote 
<br/>buying?  No one has been given a boat, we are not giving out boats or votes for that matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad is so attuned to elections and vote buying, the three of them 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sitting there in their little conspiratorial theory box and everything is about elections, everything is 
<br/>about votes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is for you, it is for you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Don’t think for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  what  we  said  was,  we  needed  a 
<br/>clarification. We do not  need this kind of pontification from him.  It was a clarification from the 
<br/>honourable Minister because in the past, they have allocated boats and it was vote buying exercise in 
<br/>the last Elections and that is the clarification we wanted. It is not a big deal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is a boat for the Ministry.  You are the one who talked about vote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>buying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are an obtuse human being, that is what you are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have covered these boats enough and we are going to move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  we  raise  and  double  the  allocation  to  Programme  2-5-8  on  Coastal  Fisheries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development ($850,000). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I wonder why the Ministry of Fisheries does not 
<br/>have this proposal issue, not driven by strategic plans.  What we see, and this is from the figures 
<br/>given  by  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  is  that  it  has  a  negative  contribution  to  GDP  and  most  of  the 
<br/>islands,  especially  in  the  Eastern  Division  -  groups  of  islands  like  Kadavu,  Lomaiviti,  Lau  and 
<br/>Rotuma, they have always been neglected on coastal fisheries development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have about 850 community fishers all over Fiji and they are not really complemented by 
<br/>the  budget.    That  is  why  we  need  to  raise  this  to  double  the  amount  for  Coastal  Fisheries 
<br/>Development.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Negatively contributing to the GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I would just like to clarify, the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said that fisheries has a negative contribution to GDP.  We have no idea what that means. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Negative  percentage.    How  can  you  have  a  negative 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percentage in fisheries? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on the motion that Head 31 be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased by $850,000 in Programme 2-5-8 with respect to Coastal Fisheries Development.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  2-5-8  -  Preparatory  Works  for  Ice 
<br/>Plants (Wainigadru and Koro), I do not see anything on freezers. If there can be allocation on ice 
<br/>freezers.    There  are  only  two  places  in  Kadavu  where  that  has  been  given,  so  I  thought  to  give 
<br/>$200,000 if that can be all over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Ice freezers is different from ice plant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, all those ice plants that have been sent, especially to 
<br/>Kadavu, they face disruptions.  What we feel is that, ice freezers would be more convenient because 
<br/>with ice plants,  you have to have water, spare parts, et  cetera.  It can be about a month, then the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries sends people to come and fix it.  So, if solar freezers can be put into every 
<br/>fishing village or community, we can put a budget of $200,000 in there. </span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is open for discussion on this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, we have just recently installed eight 
<br/>solar freezers in Kadavu, we cannot do anymore because there are other Provinces that need it too so 
<br/>we need to look at Lau.  We have installed one at Vabea, one at Buliya, one at Dravuni and three 
<br/>villages on the main island.  What about the Lau Group?  Do we take away that and give it all to 
<br/>Kadavu?  No, I am not going to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You said Kadavu too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- That is the problem when you live in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  we  have  had  sufficient  discussions  on  this 
<br/>motion.  We will now vote on the motion that Head 31 be increased by $200,000 in Programme 2-5-
<br/>8 with respect to Preparatory Works for Ice Plant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-6-8, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  there  be  an  increase  in  allocation  to  $500,000  for  Assistance  to  Commercial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Brackishwater Shrimp Aquaculture Farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- If you are seconding, say you are seconding.  Do not just raise your hand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot hear your hand, I can hear your voice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- I second, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, this is quite important, in particular, the research 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>1806 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stations  are  doing  quite  well  in  increasing  their  production  of  shrimps  but  not  enough  to  reduce 
<br/>imports.  I believe imports is over $40 million and I stand to be corrected, but there is a lot more 
<br/>import than we can produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to increase aquaculture farming here in Fiji to increase production of shrimps 
<br/>because  there  is  a  lot  of  demand  for  that  here  in  Fiji.    That  additional  $500,000  would  perhaps, 
<br/>encourage people to produce more and also for the Ministry to educate and train, particularly some 
<br/>of the landowners and fishing rights owners along the coast from Ba to Ra.  I believe those are the 
<br/>best areas for shrimp aquaculture farming, Mr. Chairman.  That would mean consultation with the 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs where the iTaukei people are to come away from unproductive way of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is talking about commercial farming, he is not talking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- … like going into commercial shrimp aquaculture farming and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>produce a lot more not only for the iTaukei people but also for Fiji as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Chairman, Sir, to reduce import and increase production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is open for discussion on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  The  honourable  Member  is  talking  about  two 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocations together, but there are two separate allocations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$600,000 for Freshwater Aquaculture Small-Holder Farmers; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Assistance to Commercial Brackishwater Shrimp Aquaculture Farmers - $250,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Which one is he talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Head  31-2-6-8  –  Assistance  to  Commercial  Brackishwater  Shrimp 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- This project has already been increased. The issue is, 
<br/>if we increase distribution to farmers, then we also have look at the production of baby shrimps that 
<br/>need to be distributed.  So those two activities need to match. If he wants to increase the farmers, 
<br/>then when we need to increase our production in producing baby shrimps so that it can fill the ponds. 
<br/>It is no use digging up new ponds without the capability of producing the post larvae (PLs) which 
<br/>are the baby shrimps to feed those ponds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You have the floor for your Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, point taken, that is exactly the point, where we 
<br/>increase the number of farmers going to commercial shrimp farming. You need shrimp post larvae 
<br/>to produce more so that additional $500,000 is exactly for that - whatever you can bring to those 
<br/>farmers into those ponds to produce more shrimps and increase production, at the same time reduce 
<br/>our imports from the other side. That is exactly the point, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. CHAIRMAN.- Anyone else wishing to take the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, just a point of clarification. Honourable Bulanauca, you 
<br/>would have heard the honourable Minister asked you specifically which one you want increased and 
<br/>you said Assistance to Commercial Brackishwater Shrimp Aquaculture Farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1807 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farmers  can  start  farming  once  they  actually  have  larvae  and  larvae  production  is  under 
<br/>Brackishwater Development Programme. That is the first one in SEG 8.  So you cannot have a farmer 
<br/>without the larvae.  You need the larvae, then you have the farmer. What will the farmer grow? You 
<br/>cannot grow the allocation for the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over 800,000 shrimp post larvae produced and distributed to interested farmers. The team 
<br/>has produced 15,340 post larvae for future broodstock and grow-out for farmers.  There is a team 
<br/>that deals with the Brackish Development Programme and had distributed 70,000 tilapia fingerlings 
<br/>to around 15 to 20 Serua-Namosi farmers.   So that is part of the growth of larvae. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then,  of  course,  you  have  the  commercial  farming  as  the  honourable  Minister  also 
<br/>highlighted - the assistance of Commercial Brackishwater Shrimp Aquaculture Farmers which has 
<br/>been increased from $175,000 to $250,000 which is an increment of $75,000. So as more and more 
<br/>larvae is grown, more and more fingerlings are grown and harvested which would then be given to 
<br/>the farmers out there to then grow it in their own farms.  This is similar to </span><span>dalo</span><span> tops and suckers.  
<br/>You give it to the farmers to grow but  you cannot say to someone to go into  </span><span>dalo</span><span> farming if you 
<br/>cannot give them the suckers.  So you need to develop the suckers first.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Yes, I understand, Mr. Chairman, and that is exactly the point. 
<br/></span><span>We have to combine those two SEGs and divide the $500,000 into two - $250,000 for the post larvae 
<br/>and $250,000 for additional farmers. That is exactly the point, it is just common sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The farmers do not grow the larvae. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had enough discussions on larvae. We will now take a vote on the motion to increase 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 31 by $500,000 in Programme 2-6-8.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-6-8 – Seaweed Development Programme 
<br/>($200,000), this is a very important programme and I just want to get some information from the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  as  to  where  your  focus  is  going  to  be  because  for  the  islands  in  the  Eastern 
<br/>Division, this programme is going to be very beneficial.  Where is your focus going to be this time? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  At  the  moment,  our  concentration  is  around  the 
<br/>coastal  areas  of  the  two  main  islands  –  Vanua  Levu  and  Viti  Levu,  around  the  coast  of  Bua  and 
<br/>Macuata and around the coast of Tailevu, Ra and Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue with the maritime islands is that, when a cyclone hits, it totally devastates the whole 
<br/>farm and the second issue is the upkeep.  From my observation, I think you are referring to Ono-i-
<br/>Lau.  The seaweed farm at Ono-i-Lau was positioned in a very distant small island quite far from the 
<br/>two villages that were actually farming.  So, we need to reinvestigate if farming can be done closer 
<br/>to the village, so that the upkeep of the farm could be easier for the villagers to look after. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, still on the same Activity and SEG 8, 
<br/>there  is  an  allocation  for  Freshwater  Aquaculture  Small-Holder  Farmers  ($600,000).    Out  of  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>1808 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  honourable  Minister  as  to  what  percentage  of  that  is  going  to 
<br/>freshwater shrimp  aquaculture, because  I notice there is  allocation only for brackishwater shrimp 
<br/>aquaculture which is the next item down from that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  basic  cost  that  is  involved  in 
<br/>establishing an aquaculture farm is that, there is $10,000 allocated for each farmer and most of that 
<br/>cost is dedicated to actually digging the pond to create the farm.  So on this budget here, there is 
<br/>allocation for a number of farmers that will be assisted by hiring excavators to dig the pond and have 
<br/>it ready, and the Government will then provide them with fingerlings and also provide them with 
<br/>feed for the first cycle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once they harvest the first cycle, they are expected to be able to keep some money so that 
<br/>they can provide the feed for the next cycle.  The Government will still provide PLs or fingerlings 
<br/>for those farmers.  Hopefully after the first cycle, they will be able to buy their own feed.  That is the 
<br/>programme that is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Does that include shrimp farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  It  includes  both,  shrimp  and  prawn.    Shrimp  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>brackishwater prawns and prawns is freshwater. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  seek  clarification  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  –  I  cannot  see  anything  on  sandfish,  although  we  have  seen  that  in  Galoa  and  it  has  a 
<br/>lucrative market as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, we were developing sandfish farming 
<br/>in Galoa and I think you visited it.  It basically depends on the traditional </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> owners to create 
<br/>their own farm.  Once they create their farm or they have allocated an area where they want us to go 
<br/>and assist them to farm, then we will move in and assist them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Already, there are Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in restricted areas within the  </span><span>i qoliqoli 
<br/></span><span>which we have encouraged </span><span>i qoliqoli </span><span>owners to basically reserve that and do not pick any </span><span>beche-de-
<br/>mer </span><span>so that they can harvest when the time comes for them to harvest.  It is already working on the 
<br/>ground, basically depending on the traditional </span><span>i qoliqoli </span><span>owners to come to the Ministry to ask for 
<br/>assistance.  It is all included in aquaculture and it is not designated here but it is allocated for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 31. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 31 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 32 – Ministry of Forestry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-1, I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase SEG 6 - Forest Subsidy on Value Adding Machines ($50,000) to add $950,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, as I had mentioned yesterday, it is important that 
<br/>we increase production and value adding of our sawn timber here in Fiji, particularly for pine and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1809 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mahogany.  We are exporting a lot more - over 50 percent of sawn timber.  We should be exporting 
<br/>a lot more value adding products out of sawn timber that we produce here in Fiji.  So it is important 
<br/>that we help or assist the landowners and other businesses, to value add sawn timber - pine, mahogany 
<br/>or native timber for export products to increase our export production and reduce imports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We may put additional $500,000 for mahogany and $450,000 for pine, plus $50,000 that is 
<br/>already  there,  so  $500,000  each  to  assist  them to  increase  their  production,  particularly  for  value 
<br/>adding.  For mahogany during COVID-19, no reduction in log sales price was made, even though 20 
<br/>percent  was  requested  and  approved  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  but  it  has  not  been 
<br/>implemented.  In this way, we can assist the people involved in the production of value added timber 
<br/>to produce more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Since there are no other contribution, we will now vote on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Chairman, I just want some clarification from the honourable Minister on 
<br/></span><span>what has been achieved so far in regards to Programme 2-2-8 - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation 
<br/>and Forest Degradation (REDD Plus) ($500,000). I think it is an ongoing programme and we have 
<br/>this allocation in every Budget. We want to know if there has been some progress on the programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Chairman, there is an increase in the budgetary allocation 
<br/>on this. The increase in REDD Plus by just a little over $272,000 is for payment of the project site - 
<br/>lease payment for Malu Forest and also the compensation of each forest ecosystem. Majority of the 
<br/>additional funds will be used for ongoing awareness and consultation towards local communities in 
<br/>the 20 Districts in Viti Levu, Taveuni and Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, in addition to what has been raised by 
<br/>honourable Jale, this REDD Plus project has been in the pipeline for quite some time now.  It is about 
<br/>the fourth time that it has appeared in our Budget. What is the formula that has now been identified 
<br/>by the Project Analyst that has come from abroad, that will accrue to the landowners?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are foregoing the harvesting of their forests through REDD Plus, you have indicated it 
<br/>already, honourable Prime Minister, that money is going to go to the resource owners.  But we are 
<br/>still waiting for the formula that we are going to adopt for the forests that are already covered under 
<br/>REDD Plus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Chairman, there is no harvesting of forests. Money has 
<br/>been  allocated  by  the  American  Government  of  $3  million  to  the  Ministry  of  Forestry.  They  are 
<br/>working on whatever the people will want at the end of the day, especially the money that is going 
<br/>to be allocated to them.  It is not a five minutes job, it takes a while before they come up with the 
<br/>right combination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for the reply. 
<br/>We fully understand that there will be no harvest  of forests but  the resource owners are  going to 
<br/>forego harvesting their forests because it has been identified to protect the forests under REDD Plus. 
<br/>So all we are asking is, what sort of formula have you identified for the sharing of whatever is going 
<br/>to come their way (the resource owners), Sir?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Chairman, as I have said, we are going through the

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments on the above Head.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A. JALE.-  Mr. Chairman, 2-1-8 -  Groundwater  Assessment  and Development  - Small 
<br/>Islands ($760,000) and Groundwater Assessment and Development - Large Islands ($2,000,000).  Just 
<br/>questioning the honourable Minister as to the reason why those two are separated - same matter, but are 
<br/>divided?  Can you explain the reason? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I think it is obviously to make sure that we do not spend 
<br/>all the funds on the large islands and forget about the small islands and vice versa, so there are separate 
<br/>allocations to cater for both groups of islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Chairman, what is your definition of small islands here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, the large islands are basically Viti Levu and Vanua Levu 
<br/></span><span>and the small islands are all the other small ones.  For instance, this year, groundwater investigation for 
<br/></span><span>the new sites will take place largely in Kadavu, Lakeba in Lau and other places like that.  That is for the 
<br/>small islands.  For large islands, it is basically Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. JALE.- I really like the way it is done because it is exactly the reason why some of 
<br/>these places in Fiji were neglected in the past.  When you lump the allocations together, small islands 
<br/>seem to be forgotten.   I think this is a good move because you really separated the two and the small 
<br/>islands will not miss out.  That is my comment, thank you very much for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, honourable Member, that is FijiFirst for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I just want to make a correction.  Someone said when you talk about small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>islands, that Bau was one.  Bau is a big island.  Honourable Members we move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-2-5 - Surveyors Registration Board ($5,000).  
<br/>I am just curious to know how many registered Surveyors do we have in Fiji and where are they placed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I do not have that exact figure with me at the moment, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can pass it on to the honourable Member if he sends me an  email.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, just to clarify, my motion was on Programme 3-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are on Activity 5 now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  3-5-10  -  Land  Bank  Investment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>($200,000).  Can we get a clarification on this allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, this provision caters for the development of land that are

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deposited into the Land Bank.  The allocated budget has been increased by 300 percent. The Ministry 
<br/>will reprioritise the projects that used to be undertaken in the next financial year.  This is focussed on 
<br/>developing access to Vunicibicibi in Naitasiri, Dawasamu, Navorara in Nakelo and Naviria in Savusavu.  
<br/>So, it is the access to those land that have been deposited into the Land Bank.

<div><span>Head 34 – Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments on Head 34. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Mr. Chairman,  just a  clarification on  Programme 2-1-6  -  Film  Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>($900,000), can the honourable Minister elaborate more on that, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  obviously,  Film  Fiji  is  responsible  for  attracting 
<br/></span><span>investments into the audio visual industry and for administering one of the most lucrative incentives that 
<br/>we have in the world for audio visual productions.  Film Fiji’s role is to develop and promote Fiji’s audio 
<br/>visual industry locally and internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In doing so, it provides film location services and ensures that we have effective communication 
<br/>between  all  Government  stakeholders  and  we  work  with  our  Trade  Commissions  in  Australia,  New 
<br/>Zealand, China and North America to promote Fiji in those particular markets.  So, this was really for 
<br/>combined efforts with respect to events, promotional activities in the key audio visual markets.  Sir, you 
<br/>do know that Annual Reports for that have been submitted – 2017, and 2018-2019 are just awaiting the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 4-2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I would like to comment and also raise a motion 
<br/>on Programme 4-2-5 - Training Expenses ($5,000).  I feel that, that is inadequate in terms of coverage of 
<br/>training and also in terms of the importance of co-operatives, as expressed by the honourable Minister, 
<br/>and there is a need to expand that training to various bodies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That we increase Programme 4-2-5 - Training Expenses ($5,000) by $500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Sir, I am suggesting $500,000 for co-operative training specifically 
<br/>or in particular for </span><span>tikina</span><span>, </span><span>koro</span><span>, villages, et cetera, who are, at the moment, coming up with their own 
<br/>commercial  initiatives  as  encouraged  by  not  only  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and 
<br/>Transport but also Ministry of Agriculture.  So, this will assist them in the setting up, training and other 
<br/>compliance requirements needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, there is also a critical need to engage cassava farmers, </span><span>dalo</span><span> farmers, </span><span>yaqona</span><span>
<br/>farmers and ginger farmers in co-operative set ups, to more effectively incorporate them into the value 
<br/>chain.  Here, I am speaking not only of value addition in terms of products but also local market and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1813 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importantly, the expansion into export market to support the initiatives of the Ministry concerned and 
<br/>particularly, for the Ministry of Agriculture’s initiatives in commercial farming.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  to  put  it  into  perspective,  the  entire  activity  of  the 
<br/>Department of Co-operative Business, has to do with training.  That specific one that you are actually 
<br/>referring to is literally just for the purchase of training materials.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Co-operative Business has actively promoted co-operative business models.  
<br/>We have conducted awareness, trainings, et cetera, and the Training Division of the Department of Co-
<br/>operative Business has managed to conduct 169 training sessions from 2015 right up to 2022.  Training 
<br/>is  provided  for  all  registered  co-operatives  and  it  is  free  of  cost,  which  actually  helps  co-operative 
<br/>members to upskill themselves in order to become better entrepreneurs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think,  honourable  Member,  you  just  may  got  it  wrong.    That  particular  provision  does  not 
<br/>necessarily have to be increased, it is really just for the purpose of training materials.  As I have said 
<br/>earlier, the trainings that we do in 2021-2022 was about 37, 2020-2021 was about 25 and as we go down 
<br/>the years, it is around the 20 and 29 mark.  So, there is enough there to cover the particular training 
<br/>expenses that you are actually referring to.  This specific one is only for the purchase of training materials.  
<br/></span><span>I hope that clarifies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I have no further comments, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will take a vote on this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 34-7-1-6 - Shipping Services Subsidy, be increased by a sum of $2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Chairman, shipping is so critical to the maritime Provinces and I think it is 
<br/>so vital that all the operations and anything to do with development depends on transportation that is 
<br/>provided mainly by shipping.  It is so critical a service to the maritime Provinces that it should be given 
<br/>that correct level of attention.  That is the reason why I am raising this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shipping services to the maritime Provinces is going to be affected through the increase in fuel 
<br/>costs.  Recently, after the war in Ukraine and Russia, the frequency of shipping services to the maritime 
<br/>Provinces has been affected. Certainly, the shipping services subsidy is also going to be affected and the 
<br/>regular service provided to the maritime Provinces is also going to be affected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is so critical and I think it is time now that the Government should consider because when I 
<br/>raised the issue about reliable, affordable and safe shipping services to the maritime Provinces, all the 
<br/>Government Members voted against the motion.  It is time now that they reconsider what they did the 
<br/>last time and try to help the people in maritime Provinces - that is the reason for the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I do understand what the Honourable Member is saying but if you actually 
<br/>have a look at the variance from the previous one, it is about $1.125 million and $128 million in terms of 
<br/>the variance so it has been increased from $2.28 million to $3.41 million. That takes into account the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actual fuel cost and the routes on that are not affected which include 10 uneconomical routes -  the Lower 
<br/>Southern Lau, Northern Lau, Lomaiviti, Upper Southern Lau, Yasayasa Moala, Kadavu, Rotuma, 
<br/>Yasawa, Cikobia, North East Vanua Levu and Beqa.  A further breakdown of those particular routes 
<br/>include Lower Southern Lau, 1</span><span>st</span><span> Northern Lau, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> Northern Lau, 1</span><span>st</span><span> Lomaiviti, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> Lomaiviti, 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>Upper  Southern  Lau,  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  Upper  Southern  Lau,  Yasayasa  Moala,  Kadavu,  Rotuma  and    Yasawa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Franchise Scheme provides 10 uneconomical routes at 15 trips per month and the increase 
<br/>will  actually  cater  for  those  additional  costs  that  he  is  actually  talking  about  in  terms  of  fuel  and 
<br/>maintenance for the private vessel operators who actually service those routes.  So, if you just want a 
<br/>breakdown, for example, Rotuma, it is actually jumping from $25,000 up to $44,857; Lower Southern 
<br/>Ono-i-Lau, it goes from $18,000 up to $29,522.  So, yes, we have actually catered for what you are asking 
<br/>for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- In regards to Goundar Shipping to Lau, they have not travel for the last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three months. Are they inclusive here?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Please, remember that Goundar Shipping is a private entity and whether it 
<br/>goes or not is entirely up to them but when it does not go, we make sure that it is actually covered.  From 
<br/></span><span>what I understand, it did go to Lakeba last week.  At times, whenever there is a situation and if an operator 
<br/></span><span>does not go, we ensure that we try and cover that through our Government Shipping Services (GSS).  I 
<br/>think quite a few of you have raised it with me and we have made sure that, that has been taken care of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Jale, you have your Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for the explanation. I think I am satisfied and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I withdraw my motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion withdrawn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Programme 7-1-6 – Land Transport Authority – Operating Grant ($21,433,217) be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased by $2 million to upgrade Navua Jetty and facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Navua  Jetty  services  Beqa  Island  and  there  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The Land Transport Authority (LTA) does not look after Navua Jetty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It is Fiji Roads Authority (FRA). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, my apologies.  Thank you for the clarification, I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>raise it with FRA.  I withdraw my motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion withdrawn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Head  34-9-1-10  –  New  Town  Development 
<br/>($3,000,000), can I seek clarification from the honourable Minister on which town is this one and the 
<br/>phases of development there? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1815 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Are you referring to a specific town because there are numerous towns? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- It says there, ‘New Town Development’, and to me, it refers to one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  It  is  in  terms  of  Nabouwalu  town  centre,  Nabouwalu  passenger  service 
<br/>terminal, for Keiyasi, Seaqaqa and Korovou.  Those are the ones that we are actually looking into to 
<br/>develop, so it literally covers those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- So, it is towns? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Township.  Does that help? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Yes, it does help which means three or four towns and particularly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Nabouwalu, it has been like that since 2018 so if you can fast-track Nabouwalu, the better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Only the FijiFirst Government is doing something about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, you cannot see me from there, but thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I can hear you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- On the same issue, this is a question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>and also seeking clarification from him.  We have heard about these town developments since 2017 and 
<br/>I think we had allocated a certain amount in the 2018 Budget.  There was talk about Navua, Seaqaqa and 
<br/>Nabouwalu being declared town and now we hear Korovou as well.  Do you have a plan as to when those 
<br/>will be declared townships?  I mean, what is the schedule?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you visited Labasa, honourable Minister, you did announce that Seaqaqa and Nabouwalu 
<br/>would be governed by their own town councils.  Of course, we do not have town councils in that sense, 
<br/>but when are you going to have these declared?  Do you have a timeline? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I think with respect to declaration of townships, honourable Member, the 
<br/>Minister responsible to do that would be Minister responsible for Local Government and they will tell 
<br/>you exactly when.  But to be absolutely specific with what you are talking about, I will go through this 
<br/>carefully, so that you do understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Nabouwalu in terms of the town centre, the civil works for the town was suspended in 2019 
<br/>due to issues of surface flooding which prompted the need for some redesign works that needed to happen.  
<br/>And there are a lot of things that had been affected by climate change, Mr. Chairman, which actually 
<br/>made us to re-think and re-engineer some of our plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The extension of time for the civil works contract has been granted and the works for the first 
<br/>phase consisting of about eight commercial lots for roading and infrastructure, such as water and 
<br/>road, will be put in, that is why you saw me on the ground.  Civil work is expected to commence in 
<br/>the first quarter of the new financial year.  There were other issues that the Ministry had to deal with 
<br/>specifically, and I am talking about the re-location of some squatters that were there. As you know, 
<br/>it is not something that you can just do overnight, it has to be done properly and we had to find them 
<br/>some other place to live.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to the Nabouwalu Passenger Terminal Service, this is actually a new initiative.  
<br/>The Ministry is currently pursuing to construct a passenger terminal service.  After having built the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>road from Labasa to Nabouwalu, Sir, a major amount of traffic actually goes through there.  There 
<br/>are some issues that are being sorted out because previously, sites that were given had to be taken 
<br/>over, et cetera, for all that, but that is happening in conjunction with the town.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Keiyasi, the civil works tender has been advertised and the tender will be awarded within 
<br/>the next two to three months before works commence on site and the duration of work is about 18 
<br/>months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  also  needs  to  be  conducted,  especially  with 
<br/>respect to Nabouwalu.  There is a Fisheries Impact Assessment that needs to be completed.  There 
<br/>are ongoing works all the time, so no one is just sitting around.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Seaqaqa, we are working on a subdivision scheme which needed to be re-worked also to 
<br/>create more commercial lots in that particular area, as well as allocate areas for market and bus stand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, just to put it into the perspective, these things have to be done extremely carefully with 
<br/>respect to the expanding population that exists in these centres. The documentation phase for Seaqaqa 
<br/>will  be  completed  in  the  2022-2023  financial  year  and  overall  allocation  for  the  new  town 
<br/></span><span>development programme now will cater for the construction of the Nabouwalu Passenger Terminal 
<br/></span><span>Service, Keiyasi, et cetera, and there are certain leases also that need to be acquired within that.  Does 
<br/>that help?  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  now  vote  on  Head  34  –  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 34 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 35 – Ministry of Sugar Industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M.T. NAULUMATUA.- I would just like to comment and declare my interest 
<br/>here.  We have supported Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF).  We are working with them in 
<br/>promoting Carry on Technology which is a technology that targets biochemical.  The land is in three 
<br/>levels - physical,  chemical and biochemical and we target the biochemical.  This is in relation to 
<br/>climate change in trying to get the biochemical level to do its work, and it has been very productive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  year, we started to fund the research at SRIF.  The Research Officer’s name is Narin 
<br/>Vano, he is in charge of this.  Last year, a farmer won the “Farmer of the Year”, increased his yield 
<br/>of sugar from 20 tonnes an acre to 50 tonnes an acre.  We were just moving along the lines of aiming 
<br/>to promote organic sugar.  I know that in Europe, their yield is about 100 tonnes per acre, so we are 
<br/>moving in that direction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had this going now and this is going to be the second year.  I just want to declare 
<br/>my interest here but it looks as though it is doing very well.  We are working with the research team 
<br/>from India and they have been working on this for over 40 years and their sugarcane is from there to 
<br/>here  -  that  is  how  effective  the  Carry  on  Technology  solution  is.    It  is  not  a  fertiliser  but  it  is  a 
<br/>biochemical solution and it works on the biochemical population in the soil.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, that is all I wanted to say and to tell you that it seems to be working very well. 
<br/>We have got another two years to go.  That is just from the private sector, interested in increasing the 
<br/>interest in sugar towards organic sugar.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1817 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, before I move my motion, I have two questions 
<br/>on SEG 10.  The first one is the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance where $1,000,000 
<br/>has been allocated.  Can we know how many farmers are going to be assisted as a result of that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second question is on the Cane Cartage (Penang to Rarawai) – FSC ($4,961,098). If we 
<br/>look  at  the average  allocation, let us say $4 million a  year  from  2017, that  is  five  years,  you are 
<br/>looking at about $20 million being spent on cartage.  My question is, whether it would have been 
<br/>better or still would be better if the Government considers a sugar mill in Rakiraki?  I know that the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister at one point said that they were thinking of a syrup mill. I want to know, 
<br/>what is happening there?  Mr. Chairman, I will move my motion after he answers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Chairman, we have increased funding in SEG 10. We 
<br/>really do not know how many new farmers are going to be involved in this.  Of course, it will come 
<br/>through the normal channel, they will ask for it and we will give it to them.  Sir, what is the second 
<br/>question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The second question, honourable Prime Minister, was on the 
<br/>Cane Cartage allocation from Penang to Rarawai. There is an allocation of $4.9 million. We know 
<br/></span><span>that if you calculate on average, let us say $4 million a year from 2017, then we have already spent 
<br/></span><span>close to $20 million or probably more on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, whether it makes sense to continue with that, or to actually build a mill in 
<br/>Rakiraki. I know the honourable Prime Minister did say some years back that a syrup mill could be 
<br/>considered for Rakiraki, so I want to know if there are any plans to put up a mill in Rakiraki or a 
<br/>syrup mill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Chairman, not at this stage, but the funding has always 
<br/>been $4 million. We have increased the funding by $1.1 million and we have come to $4.9 million, 
<br/>which is mainly because of fuel price increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  You  cannot  take  $4  million  as  the  price  we  have  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paying, it is only because of the fuel price increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What did you say, I did not get  you, honourable Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  I said, you cannot use $4 million as the base.  You are saying 
<br/>that if we spent $4 million and if you look at the figures, we have not been spending $4 million.  The 
<br/>only reason why it has gone up to $4 million is because we are taking into account the price of fuel 
<br/>that has gone up.  The FCCC has issued a pricing so there are different price points from Dravuni to 
<br/>Rarawai, Dravuni to Vitawa Bridge to Penang to Ellington, so there are different pricings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  So how much have we already spent in five years on cartage? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  We can get the figures to you, we do not have it in front of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Chairman, I will move my motion now on  SEG 10:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 35 be increased by $38 million in respect of Programme 1-1-10 to allocate 
<br/>funding for $85 per tonne guaranteed price of one tonne of sugarcane for the 2022 harvesting 
<br/>season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, despite the assurance from both the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and the honourable Attorney-General, I still find that there is no budgetary provision 
<br/>to cover the guaranteed price, that is, from the budget.  I am worried that we will not be able to pay 
<br/>that $85 guaranteed price if we do not make proper allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that the honourable Attorney-General did say on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, while handing down the 
<br/>Budget, that continuation of the guaranteed price will be there in the 2022-2023 financial year, that 
<br/>is reassuring.  But, I would also like to state what the honourable Minister said and I quote, “We 
<br/>would like to also finally assure cane growers that sufficient funds have been allocated to the Ministry 
<br/>of Sugar to ensure the guaranteed price of $85 will continue in this financial year.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Chairman, the issue that I have, the current allocation of $8 million is enough 
<br/>only to ensure that growers receive the guaranteed price of $85 per tonne for the 2021 season, when 
<br/>the final payment is topped for the last season to be paid in October.  This is even emphasised in the 
<br/>pre-election  Economic  and  Fiscal  Update  that  states  that  further  allocation  of  around  $8  million, 
<br/>dependent on the cane harvest, will be provided in the 2022-2023 Budget to meet the final payment 
<br/></span><span>for the 2021 season.  It is not clear and I maintain that there is no allocation.  This claim that rising 
<br/></span><span>sugar prices will mean $8 million is sufficient to cover for guaranteed price for the 2022 season is 
<br/>really outrageous, in my view.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By the time the 2023-2024 Budget is handed down in June or July next year, growers will 
<br/>already have received four cane payments and this would basically be very meagre amounts with no 
<br/>top-up.  I urge the honourable Members to support this motion and I think that would be the proper 
<br/>thing to do, to have the allocation in the budget for the guaranteed price. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Chairman, we have different assessments on this but we 
<br/>have already made our point in saying that our growers will get the full $85 per tonne, as we promised 
<br/>they would.  Government funds are topped up with the world market price for sugar and when the 
<br/>world market prices goes low, we step in to cover the difference.  Right now, the world market price 
<br/>is high, so we do not really need to put in that much money and we think $8 million is enough.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, because he has mentioned that we had 
<br/>announced it in the Budget and he says that he does not think that it will be enough, it is in the Budget 
<br/>and  it  will  be  enough.    Since  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  for  the  past  three  or  four  years  has 
<br/>guaranteed $85 a tonne, we have always paid $85 a tonne.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We remember a couple years ago, he said, “Oh, it is not enough, we would not be able to pay 
<br/>the $85 a tonne.” We have people here, people outside Parliament, Mr. Mahendra Chaudhry, and all 
<br/>of them saying that we cannot pay.  They went around campaigning with the farmers saying that it 
<br/>would  not  be  enough.    Then  they  were  saying  to  the  farmers,  “Oh,  you  should  not  have  these 
<br/>deductions.”  It is their least deductions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At no point in time have we ever backed off from the $85 a tonne - this is just gimmickry.  
<br/>They  are  going  around  and  saying  that,  even  though  we  have  said  that.    He  said,  “No,  in  my 
<br/>assessment.” We are the ones doing the budget, we are the ones that have actually delivered $85 a 
<br/>tonne and as we have said, the sugarcane industry is the most subsidised industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  he also  fails  to understand, Sir, is  that a lot  of the cane farmers who currently need 
<br/>assistance,  we  are  providing  them  the  assistance.    The  fertilizer  top-up  is  there  and  he  does  not 
<br/>mention that - $25 million more.  A bag of fertilizer costs $45.65 before the pandemic, now it is over 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1819 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$80.  The farmers still continue to pay $20 a bag.  No other farmer in Fiji has that benefit, but he is 
<br/>not mentioning, even all the farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Chairman, Sir, the point is that, we need to be able to put it into perspective.  Even 
<br/>though in the pandemic the Government revenue went down by 50 percent, we still pay the $85 a 
<br/>tonne because we gave an undertaking and now, when the economy is bouncing back up again, we 
<br/>are saying that we will continue to pay $85 a tonne. So, we cannot understand why he is doing that.  
<br/>Essentially, it is just some kind of gimmickry, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- My right of reply, Mr. Chairman,  I thought the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, at least, answered the question or made a sensible contribution but this convoluted 
<br/>response from the honourable Attorney-General is a real gimmick because he is not explaining.  We 
<br/>know that in one of the Budgets he mentioned, that it will not be $85.  When we raised it, then he 
<br/>came and corrected it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is our job sitting here in this Parliament right now in this Committee to 
<br/>ask  this  very  specific  and  very  sensible  question.    The  honourable  Attorney-General  is  saying, 
<br/>“Alright, you look at the world sugar market price.”  He is not even providing the basis of the world 
<br/></span><span>market  price  today,  looking  at  the  TCTs  -  tonnes  of  cane  needed  to  make  a  tonne  of  sugar,  and 
<br/></span><span>whether on the basis of that with the proceeds formula, the farmers would still get $85. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  It has got nothing to do with this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, no, that is the argument that you are making that, “Oh, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this $8 million is going to be enough.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  You’re convoluted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are convoluted, not me.  It is a very clear question.  The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister said the right thing, that the Government is making an assurance. Even if 
<br/>the allocation is not here, the $85 will be paid - that is fine, we accept that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He did not say that - even the allocation is not here.  He did not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, he made the assurance that it will be paid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And I am saying that the allocation is not here and that is what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you are not admitting, that it is not there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The allocation is here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I have to do this basic maths.  If the guaranteed price is $85 and if, 
<br/>for example, the world market price is $80, Government pays the $25 difference.  If the world market 
<br/>price goes up to $80, the Government has to pay the $5 difference, that is the point.  Why would we 
<br/>make an allocation based on the world market price of $60 when the world market price would be 
<br/>would be $80, for example?

<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Anyway, Mr. Chairman, I will leave it there, but it does not 
<br/>make sense to me.  But I would still maintain that the allocation should be here and I want honourable 
<br/>Members to support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- All you come and do here is complain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are being a Cheerleader!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- So?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Whip, speak to your Member.  We will now vote on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now vote on Head 35.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 35 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 37 – Ministry of Local Government  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Chairman, Head 37-1-1-5, I just need a clarification from the 
<br/>honourable Minister on the E-Transaction Cost ($50.000).  Can you, please, elaborate as to what this 
<br/>cost is? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- E-Transaction? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Yes, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, the Government is moving towards e-transaction.  That 
<br/>is to do with payment and receiving payments from other clients or customers and we will be using 
<br/>M-PAiSA and Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) machines to receive payments, 
<br/>et cetera, so it is a whole of Government approach.  So, we are going into digital transaction.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Another one, Mr. Chairman, if I may, on Programme 1-1-8 – Office 
<br/>Refurbishment  ($181,873).    Can  the  honourable  Minister,  please,  elaborate  as  to  which  office 
<br/>refurbishment is this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Regarding office refurbishment, Mr. Chairman, the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government occupied the Fiji Football Association Building (Fiji FA House) for the last 30 years 
<br/>and that building did not undergo any renovation either by the landlord or by the Ministry itself.  So, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1821 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is undergoing major renovations by the landlord and we need this money for cabling work, office 
<br/>fit-out, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  just  like  to  get  a  clarification  from  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  with  regard  to  the  completion  of  Levuka  Market.    There  is  a  new  Savusavu 
<br/>Market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- What SEG?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- SEG 10, sorry. Programme 1-2-10. There are new markets almost 
<br/>everywhere.   Two years ago, the Vunisea Market was put through to your attention in regard to the 
<br/>UN power.  Two  years later now, there is still no development on that  market.  Can  you, please, 
<br/>clarify?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, again, we did a lot of work during the 2019 financial 
<br/>year and after that in year 2020 and 2021.  We know what happened - COVID-19 and because of 
<br/></span><span>that, a lot of Municipal Council finances were diverted towards maintaining the safety of its clients, 
<br/></span><span>such as market vendors, public convenience, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the market that you are mentioning, Levuka Market is already under construction. 
<br/>For Savusavu Market, as I have mentioned, the tender assessment process is going through and that 
<br/>would  mean  that  once  the  tender  is  awarded,  we  will  go  into  the  construction  phase.  So,  that  is 
<br/>planned for the end of this month and if all goes well, that project will start.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding Vunisea Market, that market comes under Suva City Council. They have visited 
<br/>the place and you can see that Vunisea is expanding but the size of the land where the current market 
<br/>is, is too small. There is no room for expansion.  It is not appropriate for us to spend money unless 
<br/>and until we identify a land.  However, based on my last visit, we have made a decision that we will 
<br/>just do a basic renovation until we are able to find a new site for a new market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- On SEG 6, just a point of clarification from the 
<br/>honourable Minister with regards to Waste Collection Subsidy - Municipal Councils ($3,705,000). 
<br/>Does  that  allocation  include  other  areas  that  Municipal  Councils  look  after  in  regards  to  waste 
<br/>collection? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  There  are  two  things  that  I  would  like  to  mention  here,  that  is, 
<br/>provision  under  Rural  Local  Authority,  as  well  as  we  have  certain  sums  available  under  waste 
<br/>subsidy.    Now,  Rural  Local  Authority  Municipal  Councils  have  been  looking  after  the  extended 
<br/>boundaries like Taveuni and other extended boundaries. But that money is for the market to look 
<br/>after the market, as well as the development applications that we received from that area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The waste subsidy is given, again, to Municipal Councils to look after the extended boundary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and this is mainly for the informal settlements that are there in the extended boundary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  On  SEG  10,  I  just  need  clarification  on  Lautoka  Swimming  Pool.  
<br/>What is covered in that allocation, and if the honourable Minister can update the House as to when 
<br/>can we expect the Lautoka Swimming Pool to be opened? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  had  spoken  about  this  peer  review  exercise 
<br/>previously.  Lautoka Swimming Pool is under dispute between  the  Lautoka City Council and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contractors  and  that  requires  a  peer  review  so  that  the  findings  from  the  peer  review  and  the 
<br/>recommendations made by that report can be taken into consideration and finding a way forward for 
<br/>that particular project, so that money has been set aside for that. The peer-review exercise is complete, 
<br/>the report is with us and further analysis and discussions will take place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- On SEG 10 - National Fire Authority - Capital Grant ($3,850,000). 
<br/>I believe we spoke in this House about the building of fire stations, especially in Navua and Pacific 
<br/>Harbour.  I wonder if that allocation will include that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, this allocation is $3.8 million. The breakdown for that 
<br/>is construction of a new fire station for Navua, including purchasing of fire trucks, repair and upgrade of 
<br/>other fire stations, mainly Nausori, Levuka, Labasa and Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA.- Mr. Chairman, just a point of clarification on Programme 1-2-6 – 
<br/>Beautification of Heritage Buildings – Levuka Town Council ($25,000).  If you look at Head 21-8-1-10 
<br/>– Rehabilitation of Levuka World Heritage Structure which is also in your portfolio, you have a $1.5 
<br/>million allocation.  What is the difference between the two allocations – one is for building, one is for 
<br/>structure and who has to administer those? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, he is talking about my other portfolio, that is, Education, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heritage and Arts, am I right? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, Heritage and Arts is part of Ministry of Education and that money was 
<br/>set aside for the Levuka Community Hall that we mentioned yesterday, including the renovation of St. 
<br/>John’s Church.  So, that comes under Heritage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Local Government, we have Levuka Town Council and that money is for beautification 
<br/>work.  What we have done going forward is, we have signed an MOU with the Levuka Town Council 
<br/>for  certain other works  that  needed to be done in  Levuka  which is under heritage,  for  example,  that 
<br/>$50,000 which is allocated in the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I seek clarification on the allocation in Head 37-1-2-
<br/>6 – Beautification of Heritage Buildings – Levuka Town Council ($25,000).  Is this based on the request 
<br/>from Levuka Town Council or is this what the Ministry decided upon in giving to the Council? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, we all know the budget process.  People can come with a 
<br/>shopping list, but we need to prioritise based on the priority arears.  So, for the last couple of years, we 
<br/>have been getting $25,000 and we have invested it in upgrading the Governor’s House, so a lot of work 
<br/>has been done.  This money will be used for upgrading the kitchen and the maid’s quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 6, there is an allocation  for CEO Salaries 
<br/>for  respective  Municipal  Councils  (Rakiraki.Tavua,  Levuka,  Savusavu  and  Sigatoka).  Can  the 
<br/>honourable Minister clarify the arrangement in the payment of CEO salaries, whether it is a standard 
<br/>salary paid out to all those Municipalities and whether that will be a short-term arrangement or long-term 
<br/>arrangement, given that there are a lot of outstanding issues noted by the Auditor-General in the respective 
<br/>Municipalities and whether there are indicators in relation to the Councils paying their salaries?  They 
<br/>also have a rate collection mechanism within the Council.  Can we just get clarification on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, one has to look at the size of the Municipalities.    For 
<br/>example, Levuka, with only 166 ratepayers, how do you expect them to beautify Levuka to deliver all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1823 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the services that Levuka Town Council is expected to do?  Surely, we can increase the rate, but this is not 
<br/>the time to increase the rate because we know that people are going through hardship and we will not 
<br/>increase the rate, unlike the rest of the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, the Municipal Councils have increased 
<br/>their rate because they said that the cost has gone up.  But for this Government, Mr. Chairman, we are 
<br/>actually helping the Councils to recover from this period so that they can stand on their own feet.  But 
<br/>there are certain Municipal Councils that will need assistance all the time and such Councils include 
<br/>Tavua  where  they  only  have  311  ratepayers  and  Sigatoka  with  249  ratepayers.    So  the  number  of 
<br/>Municipal  Councils  mentioned,  for  example,  Nasinu,  Sigatoka,  Tavua,  Levuka  including  Ba,  we  are 
<br/>helping them with salaries of their CEOs because we believe that they should be paid the right market 
<br/>rate, so that they can deliver their services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One may wonder, why Nasinu?  Nasinu simply because the rate we are charging per dollar is so 
<br/>insignificant when we compare Nasinu with Suva.  Nasinu invoices just $5 million, as compared to Suva, 
<br/>they invoice $18 million, and when we look at the population size or even the number of ratepayers, it is 
<br/>the same.  That is the difficulty Nasinu is facing and for that reason, we are helping Nasinu to overcome 
<br/>that.  Now, with the CEOs that we have, Nasinu has shown a lot of progress and I would like to thank the 
<br/></span><span>CEO and the new team operating in Nasinu.  There is still a lot more work to be done but that corruption 
<br/></span><span>that used to happen in Nasinu has stopped.  We have reported the matter, it is taken care of and we have 
<br/>got a new team committed to Nasinu area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I would like to know  whether this arrangement is going to be a short 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>term or continuous arrangement or a long-term arrangement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is not a long-term arrangement.  As soon as they are able to stand on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their feet, it will be weaned off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now vote on Head 37. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 37 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 40 – Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-2-9, there is a new allocation in terms 
<br/>of $3.3 million.  Can we just get a clarification and an update on the allocation that has been given there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That Programme 2-2-9, which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Yes,  altogether.    Can  we  just  get  a  detailed  clarification  on  the 
<br/>allocation that has been given there for Supply and Installation of Nausori AWOS ($800,000); Upgrade 
<br/>of Disaster Recovery Infrastructure Systems - Nadi and Laucala Bay ($500,000); and Upgrade of Radar 
<br/>at Nausori ($2,000,000)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Which one in particular - Supply and Installation of Nausori AWOS? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The $2,000,000 for Radar Upgrade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  There is a radar in Nausori, it is aging and we need to upgrade it so it can 
<br/>provide the kind of assessment that they need for meteorological data 24/7.  This will, in turn, allow for

<br/>radar that we have.  We have one in Nausori, one in Labasa and one in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, just a clarification from the honourable Minister on 
<br/>Programme 4-1-10 – Housewiring for Completed Grid Extension Projects ($5,764,628).  Could he 
<br/>provide a brief clarification on the extent and status to-date? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, that $5.7 million is broken up into a number of different 
<br/>components.  First of all, for Housewiring for Completed Grid Extension Projects, there are already 
<br/>grid extension projects of about $1.889 million to complete the house wiring in those ones.  There is 
<br/>a new house wiring for grid extension where the grid will be extended and then put in house wiring 
<br/>for that.  That is around $2.7 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then there is a new EFL grid extension house wiring for missed out houses and commission 
<br/>projects with another $226,000, new minor house wiring project applications that came in in the past 
<br/>of around $316,000 and also new minor house wiring projects from 20 to 21.  There is a whole range 
<br/>of different house wirings that will be covered under that provision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, can the honourable Minister give 
<br/>an  update  on  Programme  4-1-7  -  Local  Funding  -  Climate  Change  Resilient  Renewable  Energy 
<br/>Development Project - 1.55 MW Solar Project in Taveuni ($530,000)?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  an  increase  in  funding  by  $330,000  and  this  is  the 
<br/>payment of the VAT component of the 1.55 MW project in Taveuni.  It is funded by Korea and this 
<br/>is the VAT component that the Government has to pay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just need a clarification on SEG 10 - Solar Home 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Systems Programme ($4,000,000).  Is it possible to update about Beqa Island? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- For Beqa Island in particular, I can pass on that information to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you.

<div><span>Head 41- Water Authority of Fiji

<div><span>Head 42- Ministry of Waterways and Environment  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-1-8 - Coastal Erosion Protection Works 
<br/>($1,500,000), I would just like to ask the honourable Minister about this allocation.    Last year during the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1825 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May Sitting, he mentioned about 12 villages in Kadavu, are they all-inclusive in this programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  $1.5  million  that  has  been  allocated  has  two 
<br/>components to it – the Bau Island Coastal Protection Work that will be rolled over and the other is for 
<br/>Ovea Village which is quite an emergency situation of 350 metres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Bau Island, the work at the moment is underway and about 20 percent has been completed, 
<br/>so there is money rolled over to complete that work.  The work should be completed in a couple of 
<br/>months’ time.  Then we have got the new project that we want to start this year at Ovea Village, Tailevu, 
<br/>from this allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Chairman, during Parliament Sitting on 12</span><span>th</span><span> May, he said that coastal 
<br/>protection  for  Kadavu  was  Namuana  Village,  Tavuki  District  School,  Wailevu  Village,  Namuana 
<br/>Village,  Nasau  Village,  Richmond  Village,  Nabukelevu  Primary  School,  Nasegai,  Levuka-i-Yale, 
<br/>Dravuwalu, Muani, Vabea Village and Rakiraki.  That was what he said in May, are they not inclusive 
<br/>in here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- In this budget also, Sir,  of $1.5 million, there is also allocation 
<br/></span><span>for Wailevu - $50,000 and Namuana - $30,000, so $80,000 for those two places in Kadavu.  We cannot 
<br/></span><span>do it all at once.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, just to let you know that through the Climate Change Division, we are working together 
<br/>very closely with the Ministry of Waterways in respect of getting the entire country assessed and we will 
<br/>do that in the next couple of months, to know exactly how many kilometres of seawall we need to build.  
<br/>Out of that, how many kilometres of that would actually be nature-based solutions and how much of that 
<br/>would be conventional concrete wall-based solutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that way, we can go out and have a programmatic approach to seawalls, as opposed to having 
<br/>one seawall here and one seawall there.  We know exactly how to roll it out and in that way also, we get 
<br/>more development assistance from the perspective of the climate change umbrella under the adaptation 
<br/>umbrella.  We are working closely with them to actually develop the entire programme for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, on 2-1-8, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 42-2-1-8 - Drainage and Flood Protection ($3,000,000) be increased by $5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. SAUKURU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  $3  million  for  Drainage  and  Flood 
<br/>Protection and I would like to propose that we add $2 million, basically for the Rewa Delta areas. I would 
<br/>like to acknowledge the honourable Minister and his staff at Luvuluvu, Nausori, for responding quickly 
<br/>to some of the issues, especially regarding one of the damaged floodgates which was flooding the road.  
<br/>There is a need to review the floodgates and drains, and also the river bank erosion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  project  is  Coastal  Erosion  Protection  Works  ($1,500,000).    Again,  this  had  been 
<br/>mentioned  in  previous  Budgets,  particularly  for  Beqa  Island.    The  funding  had  been  mentioned  but 
<br/>according to the information I have, this is for Soliaga, Nawaisomo, Rukua, Dakuni and also Dakuibeqa.  
<br/>Not only that but in the delta itself, Nukui Village is really under threat from flooding of seawater through 
<br/>plantations, et cetera, and even part of the village and Laucala Island, so it is proposed that we add $2 
<br/>million.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one is on Outsourcing - Dredging of Major Rivers and Creeks ($3,000,000).  The mouth 
<br/>of Navua River is quite shallow and because of that, when the tide comes in, there are huge waves there 
<br/>so it has always been a threat to the villagers coming in from Beqa.  A few boats have capsized there.  
<br/>We had made requests through the normal channel for that to be dredged and the dredging of that is 
<br/>proposed to add $1 million so a total of $5 million proposed in terms of Programme 2-1-8. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, we are well aware of the situation with regards to 
<br/>major rivers around Fiji.  In addition to the major rivers, there are secondary waterways, secondary rivers 
<br/>and we have advertised close to 160 of them to seek expressions of interest from private sector operators 
<br/>who would want to, on a private-public partnership arrangement, desilt and dredge some of these rivers 
<br/>where possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Navua River, we have got an expression of interest from a dredging company, but there is 
<br/>some work that needs to be done before we can get them the licence to dredge.  Navua River is on our 
<br/>list and we have got an interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got an allocation for dredging of major rivers and creeks which include Naikele River 
<br/>Bank Protection Works, Riverbank Protection Works in Bua Village and then Waidamu River Dredging 
<br/></span><span>Work.  Waidamu is right on top of our list because Waidamu River is filled with silt.  We have been using 
<br/></span><span>the excavator boom extension from Vuci Road upstream.  Now, downstream, the river is very wide so 
<br/>we cannot use an excavator boom extension, we need a dredger.  The allocation of $3 million for this 
<br/>financial year is for dredging work at Waidamu River because of the overflowing effect of water onto the 
<br/>Rewa Delta areas.  Waidamu River dredging is on our list and this year, we will call for tenders and 
<br/>engage a contractor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Navua River, we want to do it under the PPP arrangement so wherever possible, we want 
<br/>to engage the private sector so that we save Government resources.  As mentioned by the honourable 
<br/>Minister, we are actively looking at development partners and I have a list of coastal protection works 
<br/>that have already been taken up by donor funding, like the Kiwa Initiative funding that we had submitted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be doing coastal protection work for Mali Island, in the villages of Nakawaga, Vesi and 
<br/>Ligaulevu, in Somosomo Village, Navolau Village No. 1 in Ra and Navola Village in Nadroga/ Navosa, 
<br/>so we have got a comprehensive list.  We are looking at dredging and also coastal protection works, as 
<br/>well as riverbank protection works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Minister for those details – acknowledged 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and appreciated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to seek clarification, is it the dredging of the Navua River mouth and not the whole river?  In 
<br/>terms of dredging of rivers and creeks, one of the issues discussed with the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> in Rewa was 
<br/>the lack of supervision for all those who are operating the diggers.  So, we ended up with some of the 
<br/>creeks really widened so seawater is coming through.  I suppose that is a request that could be reviewed 
<br/>and also some of the floodgates.  That is all I wanted to add.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on this motion.

<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to seek clarification on Head 42-
<br/>3-1-7 before I move my two motions.   Honourable Minister, could you clarify in SEG 7, Compliance 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  Enforcement  of  EIA  ($10,000)  and  Implementation  and  Enforcement  of  the  Environment 
<br/>Management Act ($30,000), please?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Chairman, on Compliance and Enforcement of EIA, we have an 
<br/>allocation  of  $10,000.  It  is  a  mandatory  requirement  under  Regulation  34  of  the  Environment 
<br/>Management  EIA  Process  Regulations  2007  and  also  important  that  we  have  that  budget,  to  allow 
<br/>officers, particularly in this case, to travel by boat to outer islands where development is taking place, to 
<br/>undertake compliance and surveillance work, as well as undertake soil and water testing.  So, this is for 
<br/>that particular work in the Eastern Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- The second part of the question is on the allocation of $30,000 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- Implementation and Enforcement of the Environment Management Act, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- What is your exact question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I am just asking for clarification on this $30,000 allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Yes, there have been situations where we had less number of staff to 
<br/></span><span>undertake this work.  So, we are looking at getting graduates and using them, while they also get trained 
<br/></span><span>to undertake this work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would, therefore, like to move 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a couple of motions under this Head 42.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On Programme 3-1-7, Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase this allocation for the compliance and enforcement of EIA by $90,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Why $90,000, why not $100,000 or $80,000? Did  you do some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>computation?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Chairman,  we  all  know  about  the  Malolo  saga,  about  so  many  complaints  coming  in 
<br/>through the Department of Environment and I, myself, have been involved in several cases where 
<br/>citizens have come to me to complain about the fact that despite numerous calls to the Department 
<br/>of Environment, they have been told to wait, they did not transport, the complainants have offered 
<br/>their own transport to take the staff to go and check on areas where they complained. This is why I 
<br/>am moving this because they obviously need the resourcing to be able to reach the outer-islands, as 
<br/>the honourable Minister just rightly said a few minutes ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would just like to repeat, Mr. Chairman, that in December 2018, Dr. David. R. Boyd 
<br/>who was the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment, made a visit to Fiji and I 
<br/>accompanied him and his colleague, Ms. Huang, on several sites in Fiji.  In his report back to the 
<br/>Government, Mr. Boyd said that it was clear that the Ministry of Environment is seriously under-
<br/>resourced and this is one of the many reasons that I would really like to have honourable Members 
<br/>support my motion to increase this allocation by $90,000.  We talk about climate change and we talk 
<br/>about  protecting  our  environment,  why  are  we  not  adequately  resourcing  this  very  important 
<br/>Department of Environment? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M.  REDDY.- Mr. Chairman, she can talk to Dr. Boyd, why can she not come and 
<br/>talk to us and we can explain to her what is the situation on the ground?  I mean, simple as that.  We 
<br/>are here just across the road.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua has this particular narrative 
<br/>that  the  Government  is  not  concerned  about  the  environment.  There  is  a  legal  obligation  on 
<br/>Government  under  the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  to  adhere  to  the  provision  of  the 
<br/>Constitution.  For the first time, we actually have a Constitution that gives environmental rights to 
<br/>the citizens of this country - never been done before.  So, there is a legal obligation on the State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If she were to read the reports by Dr. Boyd or any other expert, if they went to every single 
<br/>country on this earth, they would all say that they need to have more compliance.  A lot of strain has 
<br/>been  put  on  many  environments  currently  in  the  world.  Even  in  places  like  Australia,  there  are 
<br/>environmental issues too.  So, please, get away from this mindset that Fiji is the only country that is 
<br/>neglecting its environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, if she actually looked at the trend of expenditure compared to 2020-2021, we have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased funding, for example, in the 2021 Revised Budget, both for staffing and various other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, increasing it by $90,000, she needs to understand it does not necessarily mean that 
<br/>suddenly, there will be a greater compliance. There is enough resources, you need to have trained 
<br/>people to actually go out and do the assessment.  She harps on about Malolo but fails, time and time 
<br/>again, to mention the fact that Malolo was a successful prosecution. For the first time, the company 
<br/>got charged the largest sum of penalty under any jurisdiction in Fiji at any point in time.  No one 
<br/>acknowledges that. And if Government did not have the will, it would not have gone through the 
<br/>prosecution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also goes to show that there is an independent prosecutorial process. Of course, one can 
<br/>argue and say, “Well, prosecution is not good, it should be stopped in the first place”.  We agree, but 
<br/>if people are going to do things in the dark of the night, if people are going to do things with those 
<br/>people who live around that area in complicit with them, it will not help.  We saw the villagers around 
<br/>that area who were given free boats and they turned a blind eye to it.  The neighbouring landowners 
<br/>were actually complicit in that also.  She does not acknowledge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every single blame is put on the Government.  Government does not go and put someone 
<br/>there 24/7 to look at what is happening.  Do not shake your head, it is a fact.  It is like saying, when 
<br/>there is a law not to steal, that people will not steal.  The point is, when people steal, the question is, 
<br/>how quickly can you do the prosecution, whether you actually want to do the prosecution or not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a lot of young people.  Again, we are taking a holistic approach to this.  If you look 
<br/>at the scholarships in Toppers and TELS, there are a number of reserved places there for people to 
<br/>do environmental science, forestry or fisheries.  We want that kind of skillsets amongst our people.  
<br/>Not many people pursue a profession in Environmental Science. Everyone wants their children to 
<br/>become doctors, teachers and engineers.  No one tells them, “Go and do counselling or forestry or 
<br/>marine science”, so we need to build a cadre of people who can do this, and that is what is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My last point on this, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, every time the Opposition stands up, in 
<br/>particular NFP, and run down the Ministry of Environment, we get so many text messages from the 
<br/>people who work at the Ministry of Environment saying that these people do not know what we do, 
<br/>the hardships we actually have to go through in terms of ensuring that people are compliant with the 
<br/>law.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nothing wrong with highlighting the problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- What is the problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  has 
<br/>absolutely missed the point.  I know we blame the Government, all I am asking for is to resource the 
<br/>Department of Environment better.  The honourable Minister in his first reply to my motion said that 
<br/>they need to send people to the islands and I think there is a need for just more resourcing for this 
<br/>Department.  I have no idea where this blame game is coming from.  Definitely, I am not blaming, I 
<br/>am just asking that this Department is better resourced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now vote on this motion that Head 42 be increased by $90,000

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  second  motion  is  in  relation  to 
<br/></span><span>Programme 3-1-7, again,  Implementation and Enforcement of the  Environment Management Act 
<br/>($30,000).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That that allocation be increased by $2,000,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P.TIKODUADUA.- I second, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  as  I  have  said  before,  we  have  seen 
<br/>numerous violations of the Fiji Environment Management Act and I believe it is our responsibility 
<br/>to approve an increase to the Department of Environment so that they have the resource, the strength, 
<br/>the power and more eyes and means of travelling to different places where the complaints are coming 
<br/>from.  I think it is incumbent on us to assist and help with the management of our environment by 
<br/>approving this  increase  of $2 million to the implementation  and enforcement of the Environment 
<br/>Management Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I  think  the  honourable  Member  does 
<br/>understand the EIA process.  It is not only about more money or more resources, it is about advocacy 
<br/>and awareness of the requirement of EIA that investors need to comply with.  That is something we 
<br/>are now increasingly undertaking.  We have got EIA clinics that we never used to do before.  From 
<br/>the last two years, we are having them - EIA clinics in Nadi in particular, there are a lot of investments 
<br/>happening in Nadi, Savusavu and Sigatoka.  We have several rounds of EIA roundtable throughout 
<br/>Fiji in a year.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  go  and  explain  to  them  that  they  need  to  fill  up  an  EIA  screening  application.    The 
<br/>Ministry will then undertake a screening to see whether an EIA is required and if it is required, we 
<br/>then  give  them  a  terms  of  reference  that  they  need  to  follow.    Then  we  give  them  a  list  of  EIA 
<br/>consultants for each area of EIA that they need to appoint, engage and undertake the EIA.  Once we 
<br/>get the EIA Report, then we give them the Environmental Management Plan and tell them that they 
<br/>need  to  adhere  to  the  Plan  while  undertaking  that  particular  investment,  and  then  comes  the 
<br/>monitoring part.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member is only talking about the last part. She fails to realise 
<br/>that there is a lot of work that goes from the beginning where each investor must know that they need 
<br/>to apply for the screening of their investment and whether an EIA is required, et cetera.  All those 
<br/>things are addressed by the Ministry of Environment when dealing with the investors as they come 
<br/>to us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank  you, honourable Minister,  for  your comments.  I 
<br/>just want to note in my right of reply that Fiji has ratified the Multilateral Environment Agreements 
<br/>as well as Human Rights Treaties, but I just want to stress, again, that we must have a strong Ministry 
<br/>of Environment to help fulfil our commitments.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 43 - Fiji Roads Authority 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, I again raise some issues from the constituency, 
<br/>even though there is no separate constituency.  We have to be realistic politically.  It is a genuine 
<br/>issue, even though I did joke.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  motion  is  to  increase  but  before  that,  may  I  seek  clarification  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister regarding increases related to roads.  If he could confirm that that would be under capital 
<br/>grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sorry, I did not get the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  For  roads,  will  that  be  under  capital  grant,  maintenance  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>construction and footpaths? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- So for Programme 1-1-10, I am proposing an increase of  $10 
<br/>million.    I  had  mentioned  before  about  the  Navua  Jetty  regarding  the  villagers  in  Beqa,  who 
<br/>frequently use that on a daily basis up to now.  It is their safety and I suppose the standard there needs 
<br/>to  be  looked  at  and  improved.    Not  only  that,  but  also  the  facilities  there,  as  the  population  has 
<br/>increased and there is frequent travel between the Navua Jetty and the Island - the waiting hours, and 
<br/>also utilities for the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, there are safety issues from Wainibokasi to Nasali footpaths, and then we 
<br/>have the roads from Tokatoka right up through that delta area that needs to be taken into account.  
<br/>But the other two which are probably in the programme, I understand, the Toga Bridge and also the 
<br/>Nasali Crossing to Vutia Road, perhaps the honourable Minister could update on those two before I 
<br/>move the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, renewal of jetties that are programmed for this year in 
<br/>terms of investigation and design are Koro, Makogai, Moala, Nabukeru, Lomaloma and Vunisea II 
<br/>which is a new Vunisea I.  What they have done for the jetties is, they look at all of the jetties and 
<br/>then they are prioritised according to the criteria that are used by FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, we know that the three major jetties for which we are completing with designs 
<br/>are Natovi, Taveuni and Savusavu.  For those ones, we are about to complete the designs, then we 
<br/>will go into construction.  So the next set that are being looked at are the ones that I have mentioned.  
<br/>So, I can confirm at the moment that Navua is probably part of the things that FRA is considering, 
<br/>but they will be programmed as we move through all the jetties that need to be looked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of Toga Bridge, there is $3 million that has been allocated for its construction.  In 
<br/>terms of repairs and maintenance, there is a budget for maintenance of roads, and the total repair of 
<br/>road corridor maintenance has a total budget of around $71.6 million.  As we know, for all roads in 
<br/>Fiji,  there  is  a  repair  and  maintenance  programme  for  that.    So,  that  will  cover  the  repairs  and 
<br/>maintenance of the various roads that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have money for sealed road rehabilitation, unsealed renewal, traffic light renewals, 
<br/>streetlight renewals and renewal of bridges.  Various bridges are funded in this budget, including 
<br/>some of the modular bridges that we have.  Especially, in the Western Division, there are two bridges,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including Naseyani in the West, Nayarabale in Vanua Levu and Vunikawakawa in Labasa.  There is 
<br/>also the Viria Single Lane Bailey Bridge that we will have and the demolition of the old Tamavua-i-
<br/>Wai Bridge that will be financed by JICA.  Those are some of the updates on the bridges and the 
<br/>repairs and maintenance that will be undertaken as part of this budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 43-1-1-10 be increased by an additional $10 million for the capital grants, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the basis as I have already explained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- As already explained and confirmed by the honourable Minister, 
<br/>there are some gaps in terms of the programming and I have already explained the various proposals 
<br/>I have made in terms of the Navua Jetty, footpaths, Tokotoko North Road and a few others which I 
<br/>have mentioned as the basis for that increase.  That is all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think the honourable Member has not given any 
<br/></span><span>outline as to where he is pulling this $10 million figure from, but let me just confirm that in terms of 
<br/></span><span>sealed road maintenance, there is $6.5 million budgeted; for footpaths, around $2.6 million; and for 
<br/>various other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, as part of their budget that we have here for Rural Unsealed Roads, there  is money 
<br/>budgeted for various roads that we are in the process of completing, including the Vunisea-Vacalea 
<br/>Road of more than $3 million.  There is money allocated for pilot cutting of new roads. I think the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  has  talked  about  the  Lagi-Tawake  and  the  Tawake-Wainika  Road. 
<br/>Other  roads  across  Viti  Levu  -  Noikoro,  Navitilevu,  Vagadra,  pre-feasibility  of  the  Kavanagasau 
<br/>Road, pilot cutting of new access roads to Nasauvakarua in the main inland of Viti Levu, other roads 
<br/>right across Beqa steep hill, Nukusere, Namuamua, Wainiyavu, Wainilotulevu, and landing works 
<br/>for new jetty construction in Kiuva and also in Korolevu. So, there is a whole range of issues that 
<br/>have been highlighted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is also important to realise that as you are programming the work that needs to be 
<br/>undertaken, a lot of work in terms of FRA is done in phases.  Sometimes, there is pre-feasibility, 
<br/>feasibility exercises, then acquiring the land, so all those things are phased over time.  So, the Budget 
<br/>Heads that have been put together also take into cognisance the capacity of our existing contractors.  
<br/>We have limited number of contractors in Fiji and they can only do a certain amount of work and all 
<br/>that is taken into account as FRA puts together its programme for the year. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
<br/>Sir.
