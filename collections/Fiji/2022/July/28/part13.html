<h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED</h3>
<div><span>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the purpose of Section 145 of the Fijian 
<br/>Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament approves -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that Government guarantees Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited’s domestic borrowings from 
<br/>1st August, 2022 to 31st May, 2028, which is the guaranteed period, for a guarantee limit 
<br/>of $75 million; and  
<br/>endorse that FSC be exempted from paying the guarantee fee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 31, I speak on 
<br/>this  particular  motion.    The  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  (FSC)  is  Fiji’s  sugar  milling  company 
<br/>incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1972 to take over the milling activities from South Pacific 
<br/>Sugar Milling and Colonial Sugar Refining Ltd in 1993.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2006, Sir, the Fiji Sugar Corporation Act was repealed, allowing it to be governed solely 
<br/>under the Companies Act 2015.  The FSC currently operates three sugar Mills, two in Viti Levu – 
<br/>Lautoka and Rarawai in Ba, and the third in Labasa, Vanua Levu.  The company is involved in the 
<br/>milling of sugarcane, manufacture and sale of sugar and molasses produced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  FSC has been experiencing  financial issues attributed  mainly to  various 
<br/>uncontrollable  factors  ranging  from  a  spate  of  natural  disasters,  inconsistent  world  sugar  price, 
<br/>milling  inefficiencies  resulting  from  the  failed  Mill  Upgrade  Project  in  2005,  the  non-renewal  of 
<br/>leases, declining cane production and deteriorating cane quality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC expects a turnaround for the 2023 financial  year which is the 2022 
<br/>season with anticipated cane production of two million tonnes and sugar-make of around 200,000 
<br/>tonnes.  Hence, $239 million in total revenue is expected from sugar proceeds and molasses in the 
<br/>projected  financial  year.    It  is  projected  that  earnings  before  interest,  tax  and  depreciation  and 
<br/>amortisation for the 2023 financial year will be positive - $23.03 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC focusses on rationalising expenditure with the key focus on streamlining 
<br/>its  controllable  expenses,  but  the  focus  will  not  undermine  any  of  the  expenditure  associated  with 
<br/>enhancing its operational performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, in order to support the restructure and financial turnaround of FSC, FSC requires
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1846 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>additional funding support through Government guarantee.  As required, Sir, under Section 62(1) of the 
<br/>Financial  Management  Act  2004,  Government  may  guarantee  the  financial  liability  of  any  entity  in 
<br/>respect of a loan or otherwise, but only if the giving of guarantee is approved by Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Fijian Government has been guaranteeing FSC’s domestic and offshore 
<br/>borrowings in the past number of years.  The latest domestic guarantee cover was approved by Parliament 
<br/>on 25</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2017 whereby Parliament approved to increase the existing Government guarantee of $120 
<br/>million to $322 million to FSC, and extended the period to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  hand,  Sir,  Government  also  guaranteed  FSC’s  offshore  borrowings  which  was 
<br/>approved  on  15</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2017,  whereby  Parliament  approved  the  extension  of  the  Government 
<br/>guarantee period for the Exim Bank of India loan of US$50.4 million from 19</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2019 to 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>December, 2028.  Both the Parliamentary approvals exempted FSC from paying the guarantee fee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC’s outstanding borrowing guaranteed by the Fijian Government as at 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>May,  2022,  stood  at  $237.8  million,  of  which  $166  million  is  covered  by  Domestic  Government 
<br/>Guarantee and FJ$71.8 million or US$32.7 million is covered by Offshore Government Guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current entities that have loans that have been approved are the:

<br/>Again, the RBF Flood Rehabilitation Fund;  
<br/>Sugar Cane Growers Fund;  
<br/>FDB Machinery Loan;  
<br/>FDB loan of $7 million;  
<br/>FDB loan of $8 million;  
<br/>FDB Loan of $10 million;  
<br/>BRED Bank Loan of $20 million;  
<br/>FNPF Loan of $50 million;  
<br/>HFC Overdraft Facility of $30 million;  
<br/>HFC  Overdraft  Facility  for three months of  $22  million;  and,  of  course, as highlighted 
<br/>earlier on  
<br/>Exim Bank of India loan at $50.4 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC, as a result of investments and Government support in the past years, Sir, 
<br/>towards  enhancement  of  factory  performance,  the  Tonnes  of  Cane  to  Tonnes  of  Sugar  (TCTS)  has 
<br/>improved from 11:41 for the 2020 season to 10:61 for the 2021 season and expected to achieve below 
<br/>10:01 for the 2022 season.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart  from  this,  Sir,  the  operating  capacity  has  improved  significantly  and  throughput  has 
<br/>increased. As of May 2022, FSC’s total operating cost is estimated to be approximately $57 million, of 
<br/>which approximately 43 percent of $24.7 million is dispensed as salaries and wages.  This was a decline 
<br/>of 7 percent when compared to $61 million as total operating cost in the 2021 financial year. This was 
<br/>achieved  with  stringent  focus  on  controlling  the  variable  cost  and  managing  fixed  cost.      Sir,  FSC, 
<br/>anticipates to right size the business and create an environment for skill and competent workforce that 
<br/></span><span>will take the business forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following FSC’s submission to the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC), Sir, 
<br/>for a review of domestic sugar price last year, FCCC has approved a sugar price increase of 90 cents a 
<br/>kilogramme, equivalent to $900 a tonne, Sir.  This will bring direct upsize in FSC’s share of revenue of 
<br/>approximately $7 million annually and will add towards profitability of the company that will support its
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee – FSC Limited  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>much needed investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The world sugar price has moved into FSC’s favour this year, Sir, currently hovering at around 
<br/>US19.5 cents per pound which is FJ42.4 cents per pound, compared to the previous price of US14 cents 
<br/>per pound or FJ30.4 cents per pound last year at the time of pricing, which is an increase of about 39 
<br/>percent, Sir.  This is projected to also improve the financial position of FSC. With the exception of any 
<br/>natural disaster, Sir, it is expected that the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) for the next five years will 
<br/>be achieved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government loan of $173.8 million that was approved for conversion into 
<br/>equity is in progress and upon completion of this conversion, FSC’s financial position will also improve, 
<br/>more specifically, the negative net equity will be reduced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the continuity and viability of FSC, Sir, the Management, with the assistance of the Board, 
<br/>has developed appropriate action plans to stabilise cane production and overall mill operations, while 
<br/>managing its debts through the support of the Government.  It is FSC’s intent to make sugar milling a 
<br/>viable business, lessen dependency on the Government and return FSC to a sustainable level in the next 
<br/>three to five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC now requires better returns from its revenue sources to invest in future 
<br/>projects that will bring needed efficiency and productivity levels that will ensure viability of Fiji’s sugar 
<br/>industry.  Accordingly, Sir, FSC requires additional funding support through a guarantee cover of $75 
<br/>million for new borrowings.  These are intended to be borrowed and have already been approved by the 
<br/>Bank of the South Pacific (BSP) for $50 million.  Another new borrowing of $25 million is yet to be 
<br/>confirmed, Sir.  The guarantee will be utilised to secure new borrowing to retire some of the expensive 
<br/>loans and support FSC’s critical capital investments towards enhancement of operational performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the financial implications, Sir, as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2022, the total Government Guarantee 
<br/>debt stood at $1.1 billion or 10.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  With FSC accessing the 
<br/>$75 million guarantee borrowing, Sir, it will increase the total Government guarantee exposure to $1.2 
<br/>billion or 11.6 percent of GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy works with FSC to monitor the restructure efforts of 
<br/>the Board and Management of FSC to ensure any fiscal risks are properly communicated and, indeed, 
<br/>mitigated by Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FSC’s key focus is on revenue optimisation, Sir.  With the abolition of European 
<br/>Union (EU) preferential price, introduction of UK’s autonomous tariff quota and high competition in the 
<br/>world market, it is absolutely critical that our branding is strengthened to entice new markets.  A few core 
<br/>areas of focus to optimise revenue are to identify new markets to export bulk and direct-consumption 
<br/>sugar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, FSC continues to embrace further cost-cutting initiatives to bring in best industry 
<br/>practices  and  efficiencies  without  compromising  on  the  quality.  The  key  to  cost  reduction,  Sir,  is 
<br/>workforce  rationalisation  optimisation  and  technology  integration  to  minimise  labour-intensive 
<br/>operations.  Sir, FSC is also looking at both, its core and non-core businesses, in the restructure process 
<br/>and getting rid of the non-core to further optimise the cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  inability  to  meet  the  debt  commitment  calls  for  immediate  intervention  and  attention.  
<br/>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Management  with  the  assistance  of  the  Board  is  working  towards 
<br/>restructuring various debts, specifically negotiating with its lenders with the view to agreeing on reducing 
<br/>interest rates on loans and extending repayment dates when the company’s liabilities are due to be paid

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or, indeed, both.  These steps will improve the company’s ability of paying back the obligations, yet 
<br/>managing its cash flow situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  robust  Learning  and  Development  Plan  is  in  place  with  the  view  to  improving  the  bank’s 
<br/>strength  to  key  trade  areas.  Through  competency-based  training,  positive  traction  and  high  level 
<br/>engagement has been achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  Performance  Management  Framework  has  been  introduced  to  ensure  employees  have 
<br/>demonstrated understanding  of FSC’s strategic objectives and performance measures.  Sound human 
<br/>resource and practices are in place to ensure FSC remains an employer of choice and, indeed, Sir, we 
<br/>were there at the Lautoka Mill at the beginning of the season and we had a good discussion with the Mill 
<br/>workers and addressed a number of the issues that they had raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Payroll Optimisation Exercise has been instituted, with specific focus on factory operations 
<br/>and non-core operational areas.  As part of its transformational plan, Sir, FSC is strategised to focus on 
<br/>its core business which is cane development, sugar milling and marketing and, indeed, working with the 
<br/>private sector, as honourable Naulumatua had stated earlier on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, FSC has decided to dispose some assets which are not adding value to its core operation.  
<br/></span><span>The income generated, Sir, will also be used to efficiently run the affairs of the company, making it a lot 
<br/>more lean and more robust and have a focus on its HR development.  This is especially important, Sir, to 
<br/>generate funds to pay off legacy loans that was inherited many decades ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to mention that there are a number of shareholders still on the 
<br/>FSC  books.    Companies  that  used  to  be  shareholders  were  Fijian  Holdings,  FNPF,  a  well-known 
<br/>entrepreneur  -  Y.P.  Reddy  and  other  small  owners  who,  over  the  years,  despite  FSC,  which  was 
<br/>unfortunately at one point in time listed under the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) too prematurely, 
<br/>none of those shareholders, in fact, contributed any equity to the development of FSC’s operations or 
<br/>indeed their assets.  Management has identified a list of properties that, of course, potentially could be 
<br/>divested in order to ensure the efficient running of FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament is invited to approve the motion that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Government guarantees Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited (FSC) domestic borrowings from 
<br/>1st August, 2022 to 31st May, 2028 which is the guaranteed period, for a guarantee limit 
<br/>of $75 million; and 
<br/>FSC be exempted from paying the guarantee fee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by saying that we support this 
<br/>motion and we will say a little bit more about why we support this motion. But  before that, Sir, it is 
<br/>important for us to state some fundamental facts about, not just the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), but also 
<br/>about the Sugar Industry in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Parliament is being asked to authorise Government to guarantee $75 million to the FSC for 
<br/>quite obvious reasons and we all understand that.  The question is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the last 
<br/>two Annual Reports - 2019 and 2020 that contains comprehensive audit of the FSC have clearly stated 
<br/>the ability of FSC to continue as a going concern is entirely dependent on Government support.  So, a 
<br/>very  important  point.    This  means  that  without  pumping  in  taxpayers’  dollars,  FSC  is  technically 
<br/>insolvent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1849 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2022-2023  economic  and  fiscal  update  states  that  until  May  this  year,  Government 
<br/>guarantees to FSC stood at $237.8 million.  This will take guarantees to over $312 million.  Of course, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, apart from the $173.8 million that Government had basically written off from FSC’s debt 
<br/>register  by  converting  it  into  liquidity,  we  also  know  that  $322  million  previous  guarantee  that  was 
<br/>extended to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2022 has now expired.  The FSC’s 2020 Annual Report shows that as of 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 
<br/>2020, the Corporation’s debt portfolio stood over $476.5 million and as of 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2020, the value of 
<br/>its assets were $159.2 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this means that if one were to sell FSC, it still would not be able to clear its debt 
<br/>since its debt portfolio is $317 million more than the assets.  Therefore, naturally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I 
<br/>have said earlier, FSC, for all its intended purposes, is technically insolvent.  It even defaulted on a $25 
<br/>million loan repayment to the Fiji National Provident Fund two years ago and Government had to step in 
<br/>as the guarantor to make the payment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proof of FSC’s insolvency lies in Government’s move to compulsorily acquire shares (and I 
<br/>know the honourable Attorney-General has mentioned that) by minority shareholder than individuals at 
<br/>half-a-cent - 0.005 cents per share last year.  This meant that the shares hold no value, are worthless and 
<br/>the offer is even below the minimum legal currency tender of 5 cents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Economy, we all know, advised minority shareholders in FSC of 
<br/>Government’s  decision  to  compulsorily  acquire  minority  shares  at  half-a-cent  per  share  by  invoking 
<br/>section 263 of Companies Act 2015. Section 263 empowers anyone holding, at least, 90 percent of shares 
<br/>in  a  company  to  bid  for  the  remainder  of  the  shares.    Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  minority 
<br/>shareholder challenged the decision in the High Court in November 2021 and in February this year, the 
<br/>Court  issued  an  order  directing  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Economy  to  withdraw  the  Notice  of 
<br/>Compulsory Acquisition of shares.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand what the honourable Attorney-General said about some of the shareholders but if 
<br/>the move had gone ahead, it would have meant severe financial losses to the real minority shareholders.  
<br/>For example, if a borrower or any other individual paid $2 per share, he or she would not have received 
<br/>any return at all with this arbitrary move by the Government.  For example, if someone had paid $2,000 
<br/>to purchase 1,000 shares, he or she would have received only $5 from Government.  This would have 
<br/>been  an  extraordinary  style  of  extortionary  behaviour  by  a  majority  shareholder,  which  is  also  the 
<br/>Government, who would have known better and should have shown more empathy to some of those 
<br/>minority shareholders who may have bought it many, many years ago.  But, thanks to the bravery of one 
<br/>of the minority shareholders, a whipping episode of naked theft and coercion (in my view), Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>was prevented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we have now  come to this  - the answer  lies in the reduction of  Fiji’s  once 
<br/>economic life-blood to a pocket sized industry in the last 15 years, both under the Bainimarama and the 
<br/>FijiFirst Governments and we need to state this fact - it is not repeating and going back, it has to be 
<br/>understood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugarcane production declined from 3.2 million tonnes in 2006, before the Military </span><span>coup</span><span>, to 
<br/>1.4 million tonnes last year.  Sugar production declined from 310,000 tonnes in 2006 to 140,000 tonnes 
<br/>last year.  A number of active growers declined by 6,000 from 18,000 in 2006 to 12,000 last year.  Despite 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we hear time and again that only this Government has provided help to the farmers.  
<br/>They did not say that the largest and most important stakeholders in the industry - the growers - have 
<br/>been voiceless and powerless, with the dissolution of the Sugarcane Growers Council in 2009.  I have 
<br/>talked about this before in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they do not say, in fact, they never mentioned that because of the Military </span><span>coup</span><span> in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2006, the growers in this country lost the $350 million grant that was provided by the European Union 
<br/>over a seven-year period from 2007.  It was all lost!  So all hopes of achieving that target of 4 million 
<br/>tonnes of cane and 400,000 tonnes of sugar per season from 2010 was trashed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC adopted two strategic plans, but it also failed.   The management structure 
<br/>of the Corporation was changed with one person becoming the Executive Chairman for a few years before 
<br/>becoming the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and suddenly resigned in October 2016.  The Government 
<br/>also appointed an expatriate Chairman before he resigned.  But that Executive Chairman and CEO is now 
<br/>somewhere in New Zealand, I am told, and no one knows the outcome of the investigation  that was 
<br/>supposed to take place to determine whether there was any financial irregularity, mismanagement or 
<br/>corruption, because we have not heard this and this is a very important point I want to make.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are supporting this motion for a number of reasons.  Firstly, this is an important industry and 
<br/>we want this industry to expand.  Unfortunately, in the last 15 years, it has not expanded.  Notwithstanding 
<br/>all the difficulties of cyclones, et cetera, in 15 years, the industry has not expanded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hear time and again from our friends from the other side that it was just because of the land 
<br/>leases.  Yes, land leases was a problem but in the last 15 years, the honourable Prime Minister himself 
<br/></span><span>has been the Chairman of the iTLTB and Government looks after the State land so in 15 years, we should 
<br/></span><span>have sorted out, at least, some of those issues so that we could expand the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I see happening here, I have confidence in the current Management.  I know some people 
<br/>who are there and the Chairman and I know that they are also working very hard (from the reports that I 
<br/>have seen) to bring FSC to some kind of financial stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not just about FSC, the key issue within the industry and the success of FSC 
<br/>will  depend  on  cane  production.    If  we  do  not  produce  enough  sugarcane,  then  everything  else  is 
<br/>dependent on it and if we do not produce, if we do not expand or increase sugarcane production, we are 
<br/>not going to grow the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Never in the history of this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, even when we had deep political divisions, 
<br/>did any government ignore this partnership that we needed to develop to keep the industry going and it 
<br/>worked for many years.  I hope that the Government will rethink some of its strategies (while we are 
<br/>looking at the strategies) to stabilise finances for the FSC.  We should correspondingly look at how we 
<br/>can stabilise the farming sector and how we can produce more cane because that is the most important 
<br/>aspect of the industry.   That is why I have been saying that we should have learnt a very good lesson 
<br/>from what happened during COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The agriculture sector and the sugar industry provided that stability for many people who lost 
<br/>their jobs.  They went back to agriculture, went back to their sugarcane farms, went back to their parents 
<br/>and that is why I was very disappointed, disillusioned and sad that this Government, of all the sectors, the 
<br/>largest decrease came from the sugar industry by about 46 percent.  And I was hoping that at this point 
<br/>in time, we should have increased the agriculture budget and we should have increased the sugar budget 
<br/>to a level where we can raise the capacity of the industry to produce more cane.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is absolutely vital that for the sake of so many people - we still have close to 
<br/>200,000 people dependent directly or indirectly.  If we look at the sugar industry, the economy of the 
<br/>West and the economy of Vanua Levu still remains a very important component of our economy.  It has 
<br/>a huge multiplier effect which the tourist dollar may not necessarily have for a lot of people out there in 
<br/>the rural agriculture sector.  That is why it is absolutely vital for us to change our tack now in terms of 
<br/>growing the sugar industry and the agriculture sector while we look at tourism as the leading sector in the 
<br/>economy.  Just sort of calling a “Bula Boom” is not going to help us bring back that semblance of stability

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to say this to the honourable Minister for Economy, he keeps saying that NFP is always 
<br/>about politics, always criticising, always disagreeing - it is not that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is our role in 
<br/>the Opposition, but as we are doing now, we are also sensible about these things and that is why we are 
<br/>supporting this guarantee. But with this support, we may stabilise the finances of the FSC to a small size 
<br/>- you cut all your expenditures, you sell all your assets, you rationalise your finances that way but it is 
<br/>going to come to a very small pocket-sized industry.  And the question is whether we want to have that 
<br/>at this point in time when we are trying to diversify our economy and making sure that we look after 
<br/>those hundreds of thousands of people who are directly dependent on the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words we support the guarantee and we urge the Government to 
<br/>create that bipartisanship.  Let us go back to the farmers, let us go back to those organisations and let us 
<br/>build that cohesion that existed, despite the politics that they always talk about.  It is not the politics, it is 
<br/>the way in which you strategise, plan and create the enabling environment for a vibrant and expanding 
<br/>sugar industry.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I also rise to make some contribution to 
<br/></span><span>the  motion  before  this  august  Parliament  on  the  guarantee  to  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  (FSC)  for  a 
<br/></span><span>guaranteed limit of about $75 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had stated in my contribution on the Budget debate, Sir, I did highlight a few facts about the 
<br/>sugar industry and as elaborated by my colleague, the honourable leader of the NFP,  that a huge section 
<br/>of our population, in one way or another, still rely heavily on this particular industry, and we simply 
<br/>cannot ignore that.  I think this is a very important paper that is before us, seeking our support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, we support the guarantee, Sir, but at the same time, I wish to highlight a few issues that need 
<br/>to be brought to the attention of the Government as well and that is, most of the things that have been said 
<br/>was quite a challenge for us in the past when we were in Government, to see how best we could revitalise 
<br/>the sugar industry then.  That was during the late Prime Minister Qarase’s time in government.  I was in 
<br/>charge of the then Ministry of Fijian Affairs and I was tasked to see how best we could advise government 
<br/>and the people of Fiji on the future of the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alternative livelihood was one but, again, you simply cannot just ask people to let go of their 
<br/>investments on the ground and then pushing for leases to expire – the people of Taveuni suffered a lot as 
<br/>well, Sir.  Our population grew by a couple of thousands with the displaced farmers who were pushed 
<br/>out of the sugarcane belts of Seaqaqa and elsewhere in the West.  But again, what we came up with at 
<br/>that time was how best we could quickly make decisions as to the renewal of sugarcane leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been hearing in this august Parliament and so many things have been said about some of 
<br/>us not supporting the renewal of sugarcane leases, but I beg to differ with that, Sir.  As a former Minister 
<br/>for Fijian Affairs, it was one of my tasks to do a complete check on where we were in terms of expired 
<br/>leases, and the potential that those leases would have on the economy of Fiji as a whole if they were left 
<br/>neglected but, again, 5,000 leases had already been renewed. That was quite surprising to me because 
<br/>even the Great Council of Chief’s (GCC) resolution was totally against the renewal of sugarcane leases, 
<br/>but iTLTB had already approved the renewal of about 5,000 sugarcane leases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We in the Ministry of Fijian Affairs at that time were in complete disbelief as to one arm is 
<br/>saying this, yet what is happening is totally different because as alluded to by honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad, a huge chunk of the population was relying on the sugar industry and then not forgetting the 
<br/>downstream effect from this particular industry - the purchasing of trucks, maintenance of trucks, 
<br/>even down to locomotives and rails, et cetera.

<div><span> Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  late  </span><span>Turaga  Na  Tui  Nayau</span><span>  had  even  made  affirmative  action  on  the  extension  of  the 
<br/>sugarcane  belt  right  down  to  Seaqaqa,  even  though  the  soil  was  not  that  fertile  to  warrant  the 
<br/>extension of this crop on to Seaqaqa, but sugarcane is still there. It has thrived well simply because 
<br/>of the hard work, not only of FSC but the farmers as a whole. The landowners were taught a big 
<br/>lesson on the importance of this industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the Master Award, Sir, I vividly remember that we even had the opportunity to slip 
<br/>in,  with  the  approval  of  FSC  and  the  iTLTB,  direct  deduction  of  rent  from  the  proceeds  of  cane 
<br/>farmers. This was supported by the farmers and the industry because it was helping the landowners 
<br/>as well and a big number of landowners.  That was one of the reasons why we supported the industry, 
<br/>that they had huge investments especially for the provinces of Macuata, Ba and elsewhere. They had 
<br/>huge  investments  -  buildings,  et  cetera,  where  the  proceeds  from  the  cane  leases  helped  in  the 
<br/>repayment of those huge investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In looking at that and as I had highlighted in my contribution to the Budget Debate, Sir, a lot 
<br/>of importance needs to be placed here because a huge part of the population still rely on the sugar 
<br/>industry.  I understand that there are issues that need to be sorted out by FSC as well but, again, that 
<br/>has been raised by my colleague, honourable Professor Prasad, regarding the case against its former 
<br/></span><span>CEO.  However, that is before the courts or probably with FICAC and they are pursuing that.  That 
<br/></span><span>is  an  issue  that  needs  to  be  taken  separately  because  it  is  under  investigation.  But  again,  Sir,  we 
<br/>support  this  guarantee  simply  because  a  large  number  of  our  population  still  heavily  rely  on  the 
<br/>industry as a whole but a suggestion to the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand the </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session with the Australian Government, honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>is  going  on  very  well.    Perhaps,  I  do  not  know  if  you  can  take  a  look  at  what  is  happening  in 
<br/>Queensland.  There are about four small sugar mills out there, privately-owned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Yes, I understand, I was about to get into that.  Those 
<br/>are some of the things that we can look at as to how best we can guarantee that the interest of the 
<br/>farmers  are there, plus  the industry.  Those  four  small  sugar mills  are much smaller than  Lautoka 
<br/>Sugar Mill and Rarawai Sugar Mill, yet they are thriving very well.  We really need to be informed 
<br/>as to the intricacies of the contract, Sir, that exists between the farmers and the mill owners and how 
<br/>they share the proceeds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This industry has, kind of, challenged us in the decision-making level of our Government, 
<br/>including the Opposition, as well as to how best we can revive the sugar industry because it is an 
<br/>industry that we look up to in how they integrate with the growers, even with the landowners and the 
<br/>industry as a whole, how they share the proceeds, how the pricing is guaranteed by Government and 
<br/>the price per tonne of sugarcane.  So many things are attached with our support, Sir, but again we 
<br/>leave it to the people that handle the industry to ensure that they protect the interest of the Government 
<br/>as well as the nation as a whole.  I fully support the motion that is before us regarding the guarantee 
<br/>to FSC, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion on the floor. I thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Members from the other side for supporting the motion as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to make an intervention here to correct the comments made by 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad and also the intervention by honourable Bulanauca.  This financial year, 
<br/>2021-2022, the direct assistance package for the Ministry of Agriculture is around $14 million.  The 
<br/>Budget that we have just passed, the direct assistance package to farmers is $26.2 million, so $14 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1853 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million to $26.2 million.  Out of the $26.2 million, $15 million we are advertising so that every farmer 
<br/>has  the  opportunity  to  apply,  including  sugarcane  farmers  who  are  also  undertaking  non-sugar 
<br/>agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to three or four years ago, direct assistance was never advertised for 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.    Where  do  the  Members  from  the  other  side  get  this  thing  that 
<br/>agriculture…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No, you have had your turn.  Just listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  are  saying  that  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  should  have  got  more 
<br/>resources.    Of  course,  they  have  got  more  resources,  from  $61  million  to  $64  million  but  direct 
<br/>assistance that we have is $26.2 million.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to say is that, they are saying that the Ministry of 
<br/>Sugar’s budget has been reduced.  We have got $9 million allocated for the Committee on Better 
<br/></span><span>Utilisation of Land (CBUL) through the Ministry of Agriculture where Government is subsidising, 
<br/></span><span>out of the 10 percent rental rate, 5 percent the Government is paying for those leases that have expired 
<br/>and will be renewed by landowners for utilisation in agriculture, including sugar agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the assistance that we are providing to agriculture is not confined to non-
<br/>sugar agriculture but sugarcane farmers will also participate in non-sugar agriculture activities, for 
<br/>example, livestock farming, vegetable farming, horticultural farming, root crops, et cetera.  By only 
<br/>looking at the Ministry of Sugar’s budget, it is misleading to say that the industry is not getting as 
<br/>much support as it used to get before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to make a response to 
<br/>the motion on the floor.  I will be brief since most of my colleagues on this side have mentioned some 
<br/>of the issues that I need to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  speak  on  the  motion,  allow  me  to  respond  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy on what he stated yesterday in his Right of Reply.  The 3.6 percent economic 
<br/>growth projected by International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an average measure which is right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Speak on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- But my point is, how we can achieve the 12.4 percent growth if the 
<br/>bigger countries are facing economic contraction, so it is simple mathematics. There is a global crisis 
<br/>and smaller countries such as Fiji will suffer greatly, that is a fact.  We rely on those bigger countries 
<br/>for  economic  survival  and  if  they  fall,  we  will  have  a  bigger  fall.  We  have  seen  that  and  have 
<br/>experienced that during COVID-19.  Yesterday, the IMF Revised Global forecast downward to 3.2 
<br/>percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  debating  a  motion  with  regards  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government guarantee to FSC.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- I will come to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We cannot set a precedence whereby Members can stand in this 
<br/>Chamber  and  start  responding  to  a  Right  of  Reply.    That  was  done  yesterday,  they  were  given  a 
<br/>chance to contribute and the honourable Minister for Economy has responded in his Right of Reply. 
<br/>They should be talking on the motion that is before this House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Member is just coming around to his point.  You have the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Thank  you,  Sir.    Yesterday,  the  IMF  Revised  Global  Forecast 
<br/>downwards  to  3.2  percent  from  the  previous  forecast  of  April.  Things  are  not  improving  if  the 
<br/>economy is expected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2022 and 1 percent in 2023.  Do you believe that the 
<br/>Fiji economy will grow by 12.4 percent?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a joke.  This has just confirmed what I said on Monday, that the Budget is a look-good 
<br/>one  based  on  lies,  dishonesty,  misinformation,  manipulation  and  distortion  of  information  just  to 
<br/>deceive people.  Based on that, Sir, I just want to warn the people of Fiji - be prepared, the worst is 
<br/></span><span>yet to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  the  motion,  let  us  quickly  look  at  the  background  of  the 
<br/>Government  guarantee  to  FSC.    On  26</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  2017,  the  Government  of  Fiji  increased  the 
<br/>Government guarantee of $120 million to $322 million and guarantee period has been extended up 
<br/>to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2022, as mentioned by my colleague that it has expired.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  26</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  Parliament  unanimously  agreed  for  FSC  to  be  exempted  from  paying  a 
<br/>guarantee fee since the Government increased the existing guarantee to $322 million.  In that speech, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  stated  that  the  increase  in  guarantee  will 
<br/>allow  FSC  to  undertake  a  number  of  capital  projects,  including  mechanisation,  and  development 
<br/>programmes to increase production at a low cost, meaning a reduction in the cost of production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  17</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  2019,  a  motion  moved  by  honourable  Tikoduadua  to  establish  a  bipartisan 
<br/>committee  on  sugar  to  collectively  find  solutions  to  revive  the  sugar  industry  was  defeated  in 
<br/>Parliament and in that debate, the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 
<br/>Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management (whose is not here in the House) said 
<br/>that the problem in the sugar industry is that, past Governments neglected it.  He further stated that 
<br/>if we want the sugar industry to grow, let us get rid of the cobweb by killing the spider. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister added that the motion was a waste of resources and waste of 
<br/>time. He further added that the increase in productivity will come from reducing production cost and 
<br/>increasing  cane  production.  I  wonder  if  both  Ministers  have  taken  time  to  read  the  FSC  Annual 
<br/>Reports that clearly stated that in 2006, the industry had 18,600 active cane growers who produced 
<br/>3.2 million tonnes of cane. Today, what we have got is only 11,000 active farmers and producing 1.7 
<br/>million tonnes of cane.  What have they been doing with the $400 million that had been injected into 
<br/>the Ministry for the last five years?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  It is not the Ministry, it’s  FSC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I. KURIDRANI.- Sir,  FSC through the Ministry.  What  were they doing?  May be 
<br/>sleeping and making cobwebs.  Then who is the spider that needs to be killed?  Who has neglected 
<br/>the industry?  You be the judge.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1855 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 27</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2021, the Government intended to convert FSC’s $173.8 million into equity.  
<br/>Why?  Because FSC was not able to service its debt.  So we are going to support and approve this 
<br/>Government guarantee  today because we think of the people who will benefit - the 200,000 families 
<br/>out there who rely on this industry.  We will approve it, we will support it and we will do it for the 
<br/>sake of those people, not for this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this guarantee will follow the same trend.  The reality is that, the farmers are only getting 
<br/>around $35 net profit for every tonne of cane that is being produced.  A farmer producing 300 tonnes 
<br/>per annum, his total income is around only $10,500.  Do you think that is enough for a family of 
<br/>five?  That is why the Fiji Government has stepped in to pay $550,000 for the 600 farmers in the 
<br/>North.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year’s Budget booklet stated that FSC’s contingent liability is $237.8 million, which this 
<br/>additional guarantee of $75 million will raise our total liability to $312 million, and this will increase 
<br/>the risk, which I have stated in this Parliament on Monday.  The higher the debt, the less revenue 
<br/>available  for  the  Government  to  provide  service  to  its  people,  because  the  first  call  of  every 
<br/>government revenue is to service the loan, its principal and its interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already informed Parliament during my Budget response on Monday 
<br/></span><span>that  our  GDP  per  capita  income  has  declined  from  $12,000  in  2018  to  $9,000  in  2020,  due  to 
<br/>reduction of revenue and increase of debt.  What does that indicate?  A low GDP per capita indicates 
<br/>a country struggling to comply with its citizens basic needs. That is what the grassroots are facing 
<br/>today.  People are struggling but, unfortunately, the Minister and the Assistant Ministers will say that 
<br/>we are lying … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  You are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- … because they are members of the rich community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many studies have been done after the events of 2006 to revive the sugar 
<br/>industry,  but  has  the  Ministry  implemented  the  reports’  recommendations?    The  poor  trend  just 
<br/>indicate that they have not.  Sugarcane production has continued to decline, the number of active 
<br/>farmers continued to decline, the TCTS has not improved, hovering only around 10.46 while the best 
<br/>should be nine, and sugar exports including molasses, declined substantially from $224 million in 
<br/>2006 to around $87 million in 2021, a reduction of more than 50 percent.  Those indicators prove 
<br/>that the Government reform has failed miserably.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  suggesting  to  the  Government  to  immediately  reconsider  the 
<br/>Alternative Livelihood Programme at FSC in order to revive this main industry.  I am also asking 
<br/>this  Government  if  they  can  consider  establishing  trans-loading  zones,  especially  for  the  isolated 
<br/>farmers in the province of Nadroga/Navosa, Ba, Seaqaqa in Macuata, Ra and Nasarowaqa in Bua.  
<br/>Those are some of the measures they need to undertake in order to revive the industry.  Amalgamate 
<br/>smallholding farmers for the benefit of mechanisation and ease of administration, and increase the 
<br/>number of field officers.  At the moment, the ratio is around 1:700 farmers.  We only have 365 days 
<br/>in one year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, we need to ensure that internal control measures should be in place for the efficient 
<br/>and effective implementation of this Government’s programme to avoid over-expenditure and corruption 
<br/>and improve capacity for monitoring and evaluation.  Proper management of expenditure is fundamental 
<br/>in ensuring value for money in delivering service to the sugarcane farming community.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I support this motion.

<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  on  the 
<br/>Guarantee to Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC).  When looking at FSC, it is very important to also look 
<br/>at  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  Industry  and  a  quote  from  the  Summary  Statement  of  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary for the 2018-2019 Financial Year Annual Report said, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For 2018-2019 financial year, a total of $62.3 million was allocated to the industry 
<br/>by  Government.    An  additional  $6  million  was  provided  by  the  government  for  cane 
<br/>payment top-up for 2017 crops. The Ministry together with the assistance of the industry 
<br/>institutions  implemented  the  following  capital  projects;  Sugarcane  Development  and 
<br/>Farmers Assistance Program (SDP) Grants - FSC, Fertilizer Subsidy - SPFL, Weedicide 
<br/>Subsidy  –  SPFL,  Sugarcane  Small  Grants  Scheme,  Farm  Mechanization,  Cane  Cartage 
<br/>Program – FSC and Cane Access Road (CAR) Programme – FSC.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there was quite a substantial portion of the funding through the Ministry which was through them, 
<br/>administered or carried out by FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I share the concerns in this same Report.  The Report itself on the financials, it is a qualified 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opinion and the basis of that, and let me read it out states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“1.  There  is  an  unreconciled  variance  of  $1,820,659  and  $3,838,071  between  the  cane 
<br/>access  roads  and  cane  planting  grant  acquittals  respectively  and  bank  statement 
<br/>balance  of  the  cane  access  roads  and  cane  planting  grant  maintained  by  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation. Consequently, I couldn’t not confirm the accuracy of the Capital grants 
<br/>and transfers amounts of $57,750,367 reflected in the financial statements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.  The Cane Top-up payment of $3,134,295 and $2,869,165 was incorrectly posted to 
<br/>Sugar  Development  and  Farmers  Assistance  program  allocation  and  Cane  Access 
<br/>Road  allocation respectively. Consequently, the  general  ledger account  of the Cane 
<br/>Top-up  payment  is  understated  by  $6,003,460,  and  the  general  ledger  of  the  Sugar 
<br/>Development and Farmers Assistance  program allocation and Cane Access Road is 
<br/>overstated by $3,134,295 and $2,869,165 respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.  The acquittals totalling  $5,659,906 submitted by the Fiji Sugar Corporation did not 
<br/>provide  proper  records  for  all  costs  incurred  and  the  utilization  of  the  cane  cartage 
<br/>grant in accordance with the requirements of section 6.1 of the Grant Agreement.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So those are the concerns we would like to also raise here in Parliament in relation to the motion at 
<br/>hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the unreconciled variance mentioned, the substantial variances of $1.8 million for Cane 
<br/>Access  Roads and $3.8 for Cane Planting Acquittals  and the bank statement balance of the Cane 
<br/>Access  Roads  and  cane  planting  grant  maintained  by  FSC  are  not  small  amounts  but  are  very 
<br/>significant  amounts.    The  variances,  taken  together,  represent  9.79  percent  of  total  grants  and 
<br/>transfers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  should,  therefore,  from  my  perspective  ensure  that  accounts  are  reconciled 
<br/>before the financial statements are drafted.  The question that we need to ask is, what are the reasons 
<br/>for those unreconciled variances and whether the variances were responsible for the redeployment of 
<br/>fund of $6 million instead of $4.5 million as per the report on Note 4 by the Permanent Secretary? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue,  as  I  had  already  mentioned,  is  the  incorrect  amounts  in  the  cane  top-up 
<br/>payment.  The incorrect amount in the ledgers is a concern and that has resulted in the unnecessary 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited

<div><span>1857 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work that could have been avoided if those responsible had taken care of their work.  The question 
<br/>that  arises  which  we  need  to  ask  today  is,  what  is  the  problem  with  those  responsible  for  the 
<br/>maintenance of accounts and the preparation of financial statements and the reasons for the anomaly? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the acquittals, the non-submission of acquittals is a weakness which should never have 
<br/>happened when $5.7 million is involved.  Again, we ask, what internal controls are in place in terms 
<br/>of agreement procedures?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On page 25 of that Report, on Appropriation Statement, there is an unused provision - a sum 
<br/>of  $5.9  million  was  allocated  under  Special  Expenditures  in  terms  of  the  tribunal,  policy 
<br/>development, et cetera.  Out of this $5.9 million, only $179,315 or 3 percent was used during the 
<br/>year.    Again,  the  question  is,  what  are  the  reasons  for  this  high  unused  provision  under  Special 
<br/>Expenditures?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the issues, Sir, I would like to raise today as per the guarantee in front of 
<br/>us so it points back to proper utilisation, accountability and also transparency in the use of public 
<br/>funds which are channelled through the Ministry of Sugar Industry for utilisation by sugar industry 
<br/>stakeholders and partners.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  want  to  be  very  brief  in  my 
<br/>contribution.  We have talked about how important this guarantee is to FSC.  We have also listened 
<br/>throughout the week about the contributions of other forms of livelihood which are being encouraged 
<br/>to those who are in the sugarcane industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what is important and I think those that have spoken from the other side have 
<br/>also agreed, that we must support the motion that is before Parliament because it is the livelihood of 
<br/>our people that are in the sugar industry.  We cannot pull the carpet out from their feet at the moment, 
<br/>we cannot do that.  By saying anything else and then saying you support, is contradictory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in a very convoluted way, they finally agreed that they support the motion before 
<br/>Parliament.  It is like going from here to Sigatoka by going on the Kings Road.  It is very simple, 
<br/>very simple.  If you support the motion before Parliament, you just go from here to Sigatoka and just 
<br/>say you support the motion.  What does he mean from a health perspective?  This is what is important 
<br/>from a health perspective.  We just talked about the economic ramifications that we faced here in 
<br/>Fiji, how we are trying to ensure that no one stays in poverty, that we strengthen and ensure that 
<br/>everyone is empowered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A significant part of our community are in the sugar industry.  What do we expect them to do 
<br/>if we actually do not support the motion before Parliament, have another scenario where people come 
<br/>and live in the squatter settlements?  Is that what we are looking at?  Of course, not.  We want them 
<br/>to be supported so they can be strong, they are able to fend for themselves, they have a place to farm 
<br/>and they can live a good part of their life.  That is the whole reason of this motion and why we should 
<br/>support that motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I support the motion that is before Parliament and I ask honourable Members on the other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>side, if you support a motion, do not be convoluted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  join  my  fellow  colleagues  in  support  of  the 
<br/>motion before Parliament on the Government guarantee for Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) Limited’s 
<br/>domestic borrowing from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2028 for a guarantee limit of $75 million and 
<br/>endorse that FSC be exempted from paying the guarantee fee.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Sugar for his 
<br/>profound vision in ensuring that we continue to support our sugar industry.  This ensures that our 
<br/>farmers are provided with the best to safeguard the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to growing cane, our Government knows where our support 
<br/>matters most. The Government has guaranteed a price of $85 per tonne, despite misinformation to 
<br/>the public by ignorant people through deceitful lies, just to keep their vote bank and political lies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government is also easing the burden of cost by subsiding fertiliser.  
<br/>We  are  upgrading  cane  access  roads.  We  are  covering  for  the  cane  cut  cost  and  investing  in 
<br/>modernisation.  In addition, we have built better and more productive measures to ensure that we 
<br/>continue to provide the best industry for our farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government under the visionary leadership of our honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, has shown unprecedented level of commitment to the sugar industry ever since coming into 
<br/>the office.  The Opposition continues to play politics with the farmers.  However, our honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister intervenes to resolve and assist the farmers with FSC in providing a solution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that the so-called experts of the sugar industry, who have 
<br/></span><span>no connection with the farmers, continue to make unnecessary comments and decisions based on 
<br/>unrealistic assumptions.  I challenge them to understand the industry before making any comments 
<br/>as our farmers are educated people and they understand the efforts of this Government and the efforts 
<br/>put in by FSC in ensuring that we have a successful harvesting season.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, not just us, it is the farmers who had also agreed that it is very hard to make 
<br/>money from the sugar industry.  We have heard the NFP always blaming the past 15 years. It was 
<br/>the doing of people like Mr. Qarikau and Mr. Niko Nawaikula that brought the industry down to its 
<br/>knees, as well as the Qarase Government from 2001 to 2006, and that is a fact, Mr. Speaker.  Sir, had 
<br/>the Qarase Government continued, the industry would have died in a couple of years, and this is the 
<br/>fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is because of the honourable Prime Minister that the sugar industry is still 
<br/>surviving.  It is because of the investment from the FijiFirst Government that the industry is surviving.  
<br/>Now, we need to invest into substantive farming and alternate farming, as we know that more than 
<br/>40 percent  of farmers plant less than 100 tonnes. The struggle and efforts put  together to  farm is 
<br/>outweighing the return. How can farmers survive with a net income of $4,000 to $6,000 a year, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have visited cane farmers everywhere in Fiji. Our Government deeply 
<br/>appreciates the effort of our cane farmers and FSC for the numerous decisions with key stakeholders 
<br/>on improving the industry.  Our farmers are always known to be amongst the hardest working people 
<br/>in Fiji and surely anywhere in the world.  They continue to help our industry grow, despite climate 
<br/>change setbacks and natural disasters.  Sir, our sugar industry will always remain at the heart of the 
<br/>Fijian economy and that commitment is as strong now as ever before.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and 
<br/>I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the motion in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry continues  to  be a significant  industry in  the Northern and the Western 
<br/>Divisions.  A lot of families are involved in the sugar industry and we should not play politics with 
<br/>it.  The sugar industry, prior to 1987, had close to 22,000 farmers.  It reduced close to 11,000 farmers 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1859 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 1987, the sugar production has steadily declined and the number of farmers in the sugar 
<br/>industry  has  steadily  declined.    Production  of  sugar  and  molasses  have  steadily  declined  as  well.  
<br/>Together with the sugar industry, there was another industry that was left to die a natural death and 
<br/>that was the rice industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry continues to play a vital role in people’s lives and the country’s economy.  
<br/>It is no rocket science why both the industries were left to die. Yet, again, we have members who 
<br/>stand and say that since 2006, nothing has been done in the sugar industry.  Not a word from  the 
<br/>honourable Members of NFP, not at any time have they said anything that after 1987, the industry 
<br/>started to decline.  Why are they mentioning that?  At least, have the courtesy of saying where it all 
<br/>started. Do not pick up in the middle of the game and start running with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that shows the mentality of a leader that he wants to be.  It is the Bainimarama 
<br/>Government  when  it  came  into  power  and  after  that,  the  FijiFirst  Government,  which  has  invested 
<br/>significantly into the sugar Industry.  It has invested in the mills, the infrastructure and on the farms.  It 
<br/>started cane planting programmes, fertiliser subsidy, chemical subsidy and all other grants to ensure that 
<br/>the farmers are able to continue in the sugar Industry.  They have not left the farmers behind, and they 
<br/>continued to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The best way to do is to build the capacity of FSC and that is why this guarantee is necessary, to 
<br/>build FSC’s capacity.  Can at least those honourable Members who call us for “doing nothing to the sugar 
<br/>industry” have that courtesy of acknowledging where the decline was and start supporting?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Listen!  If you are interested in the sugar industry, you listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry continues and will be supported by the FijiFirst Government.  I hope everyone 
<br/>in this Parliament supports the industry to help the farmers grow, help the industry grow and to ensure 
<br/>that farmers have a sustainable livelihood.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was my short contribution 
<br/>and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will have a brief contribution in supporting the 
<br/>motion.   However,  we should ask  ourselves, why the  guarantee?  The  Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) 
<br/>cannot substantiate itself to the lender or the bank.  The bank or the lender have no confidence in it.  They 
<br/>need a guarantee from someone else (Government) for that, so it is important to make FSC profitable.  If 
<br/>it cannot be profitable, let it go, but we cannot do that.  We cannot let it go.  Why?  Because 200,000 
<br/>families are involved here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot just let it go, that is why we are supporting the guarantee to ensure its continuation.  
<br/>We have to do a lot of things, maybe I am not a cane grower, I did not grow up in the cane fields but, at 
<br/>least, I know something about it.  We have to diversify, as the honourable Minister for Agriculture had 
<br/>mentioned, but what  I  am saying is,  it is  not  enough.  Diversify  to the extent that they  can  be more 
<br/>profitable and can help them in the cane industry or to surpass the cane output - whether it is coconut, 
<br/>vanilla,  cotton,  wheat,  cassava,  guava,  dragon  fruit,  livestock,  crops  or  vegetables,  it  is  important  to 
<br/>increase it to a stage where it can be profitable.  We appreciate what has been done, but we need more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, we have to look at value adding within the sugar industry, whether it is in molasses, white 
<br/>sugar  or  whatever,  experts  can  do  that  for  us.    But  it  is  important  to  increase  our  export  from  cane 
<br/>production and reduce our import of white sugar, et cetera.  It is important to do all that.

<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As already mentioned as well by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, perhaps you should 
<br/>have a look at the model in Queensland and New South Wales.  They have only four small mills there 
<br/>but they are profitable and they are working quite well.  Perhaps, that is the way to go but advertise it - 
<br/>open up new areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard that they are opening up a highway from Nadi to Suva which is good.  That has 
<br/>been highlighted in this Parliament by the then honourable Vincent Lobendhan of the SVT Government</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/>The then honourable Chaudhry mentioned it as well, I also mentioned it twice in this Parliament and you 
<br/>laughed at it but now you are copying it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad that today, they have come up with it, for a highway from Nadi to Suva so that it can 
<br/>open up new areas for cane planting.  It is very important to open up new areas for cane.  Some of the old 
<br/>areas have been used by either tourism, residential, industrial or commercial and we cannot stop that 
<br/>because the landowners say whether it is Freehold or Crown land or Native land, the landowner will want 
<br/>high returns.  All we have to do is open up new areas, get the cane and the land there is also richer than 
<br/>the older ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, to look outside the box, as the honourable Minister for Economy 
<br/>used to say.  Why it is profitable in Queensland and New South Wales because it is freehold and we can 
<br/>do that here as well.  Even with Native land, we can issue 99 year leases for agriculture or cane leases but 
<br/>subject to the landowner’s consent, fair returns and benefits, as we go along.  We work together to get 
<br/>the cane going and support the 200,000 or even 300,000 people.  It is important, Sir, to look at those 
<br/>areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have also been talking about the non-renewal of leases and they are blaming me for that.  Why 
<br/>are they blaming me?  The honourable Prime Minister is pointing at me.  I was only the Acting General 
<br/>Manager for one year in 1990.  We were issuing renewals, so do not point wrongly at people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was renewing leases.  Someone else came in and did not renew the leases, so do not point at me.  I can 
<br/>give you more leases to lease on my land.  If you can plant cane, then I can give it to you.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  increase  our  production  and  then  cut  down  our  cost  of 
<br/>production to be profitable.  I am also glad that FSC has involved </span><span>i Taukei</span><span> landowners to form sugarcane 
<br/>cooperatives in Nasorowaqa and in Vesidrua.  That is the way to go and get more production, get more 
<br/>Native land into cane production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to pursue those various areas rather than being negative about it.  
<br/>Many years ago, there was no renewal but they are still talking about non-renewal.  Can we talk about 
<br/>renewals now?  Do not take us back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  that  we  also  involve  sugarcane  growers  and 
<br/>stakeholders, such as the iTaukei Land Trust Board and Ministry of iTaukei Affairs in all these things.  
<br/>The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs needs to drive the </span><span>i Taukei</span><span> landowners from the unproductive way of life 
<br/>to productive  way  of life.   That  is very important  because farming  itself is  living, so  you must have 
<br/>properly-managed time and manage every resource to be productive.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 
<br/>motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this motion.

<div><span>Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1861 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am standing in support of this motion.  I would just like to bring to the attention of Parliament the 
<br/>number of issues that are faced by farmers and the mill itself so that we have a good idea.   I have been 
<br/>working with the industry since 2018 and I have been on the ground, moving around meeting farmers, 
<br/>looking at the Mills and trying to see the issues that are affecting the whole sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we have to have a holistic look at the whole thing before we make any decision as to how 
<br/>we go forward.  We just cannot be one-sided on any issue.  Some of those issues you have mentioned 
<br/>include; non-renewal of leases.  Yes, we all agree.  If leases are not renewed on time, as we know that 
<br/>four years prior to the expiry of leases the farmers need to apply and if the response does not come on 
<br/>time, then the farmers become worried about whether their leases will be renewed or not.  They will 
<br/>decline to work on their fields to increase productivity - that is one area.  Then we have labour shortage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been told in this Parliament that there are ageing farmers on the ground.  In some areas, 
<br/>we have the husband and wife harvesting cane.  I think one or two years back, we had to get labourers 
<br/>from Vanuatu to harvest cane but because of COVID-19 we could not do that, so labour was an issue.  
<br/>Then we have climatic conditions. We all know the number of cyclones that have struck Fiji.  If we have 
<br/>a Category 5 cyclone, after that, almost two years you have to get back to where you were and it does not 
<br/>grow overnight.  That has been happening with the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Field Officers and FSC have been working very hard and they keep us posted in terms of 
<br/>what they are doing on the ground.  We can see the tremendous work done by our Field Officers and the 
<br/>FSC Team as a whole.  But if a cyclone strikes, then there goes our hard work.  That is how production 
<br/>fell last year, but no-one mentioned that.  Why did it fall?  It is not because someone did not work.  The 
<br/>farmers did their part, FSC did their part but then climatic conditions played its part and the whole thing 
<br/>just  collapsed.    This  year,  if  good  weather  prevails,  then  we  are  going  to  see  big  improvements  in 
<br/>production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also see the transportation costs and these things also affect the farmers’ production because 
<br/>now, the costs are going up.  They are very wary of that, but we thank the Government for coming up 
<br/>with the assistance that is being provided, just like the fertiliser subsidy.  It is an incentive to farmers.  The 
<br/>transport  cost that is  being subsidised from  different parts of the  different  areas is  going to  help our 
<br/>farmers mitigate this problem of cost and incentivise them.  It is our duty to encourage farmers to diversify 
<br/>and at the same time, increase production if they are going to get more returns from the farm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  in  support  of  the  motion 
<br/>presented before Parliament by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy.   And I say 
<br/>that no right thinking person will have disagreement with this motion, on the importance of the sugar 
<br/>industry to the Fijian economy and our society.  It supports a large portion of the Fijian population with 
<br/>the livelihood of tens of thousands of Fijians depending on this industry, either directly or indirectly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank honourable Members on the other side of Parliament who have spoken in support and 
<br/>endorsed the motion before Parliament.  I thought I would just make a couple of comments to honourable 
<br/>Kuridrani.  The dumping of loads at designated places results in huge sugar loss.  It has been tried in 
<br/>Rakiraki and transferred to Ba, and we have found out that there is a huge sugar loss in that process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To honourable Professor Prasad, production has been increasing and in 2016, it was around 1.3 
<br/>million tonnes and then it increased to 1.7 million tonnes in 2020.  But it declined for reasons well-known 
<br/>before Parliament and I do not have to explain that. There were 14 cyclones, causing damages to more 
<br/>than 56,313 hectares of cane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is a majority shareholder in FSC and 80 percent of sugar produced 
<br/>in Fiji is exported, making it a significant source of foreign exchange.  It is critical that the industry and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Government Guarantee – FSC Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the people who depend on it are supported, and my Government has been doing that consistently.  As I 
<br/>have said before, we will ensure that sugarcane growers continue to receive $85 per tonne price as we 
<br/>have done for the last four years.  What this means, Sir, is that, our farmers will be protected in the unlikely 
<br/>event that global prices decline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Productivity at the farm level is my greatest priority for the sugar industry.  Government is doing 
<br/>its part by subsidising fertilizer, despite the increase in the world fertilizer price which continues from the 
<br/>previous budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cane cartage support to farmers continues as well and we have increased funding to the Sugar 
<br/>Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) with a longer term, a goal of developing better quality cane planting and 
<br/>adopting new technologies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the international stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been an active member of the International 
<br/>Sugar Organization (ISO) since 1992 and we currently serve as Chair of the ISO Council.  As such, Fiji 
<br/>will host the 60</span><span>th</span><span> ISO Council Meeting in August this year, which will be attended by more than 80 
<br/>countries, all focused on improving the World Sugar Markets through the exchange of knowledge and 
<br/>experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the failed STM Project under the SDL Government resulted in direct loss to the 
<br/>FSC  of  over  $300  million,  and  it  is  now  up  to  us  to  fix  that.    For  those  sitting  on  the  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament, I suggest that you, please, read the KPMG Report to get the facts right before you speak here 
<br/>on this subject.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mess was created by those who occupied the seats that govern the industry in 2004.  The 
<br/>government at that time obtained a line of credit of over $50.4 million in July 2005 from Exim Bank India 
<br/>to upgrade the sugar industry and this loan was guaranteed by Government to pay the Indian contractor 
<br/>for  work  undertaken.    However,  after  the  supposed  completion,  there  were  several  difficulties 
<br/>experienced.  Technical assessments were conducted by the Indian consultants between 2009 and 2013 
<br/>that confirmed the need for significant remedial works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an additional line of credit of $5.38 million was undertaken in 2015 to pay the 
<br/>Indian consultants for remedial works which, again, did not fix the problem.  KPMG Australia was then 
<br/>engaged to conduct an audit of the project and their forensic report concluded that the project failed to 
<br/>deliver its objectives due to the poor quality of equipment and materials supplied by the Indian vendors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite those issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry is recovering, production has improved 
<br/>and FSC’s underlying financial performance is turning around.  Sir, FSC expects a turnaround for the 
<br/>2023 Financial Year reflecting the 2022 season, with anticipated cane production of 2 million tonnes, 
<br/>sugar make of around 200,000 tonnes and TCTS of 10.  At this point in the season, Sir, we expect to 
<br/>achieve those projected results with $239 million in total revenue expected from sugar proceeds and 
<br/>molasses in the projected financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FSC  is  rationalising  its  expenditures  with  a  key  focus  on  streamlining  its 
<br/>controllable expenses.  However, it must be noted that this exercise will not affect expenditures associated 
<br/>with improving operational performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FSC has developed a very pragmatic action plan to stabilise FSC’s liquidity, boost 
<br/>cane  production  and  improve  mill  operations  while  managing  its  debts.    This  is  all  targeted  towards 
<br/>transforming FSC into a viable corporate entity and, of course, reducing its dependence on Government 
<br/>so that it becomes a sustainable business in the very near future.

<div><span>For the continuity and viability of FSC, Mr. Speaker, the Management with the assistance of the 
<br/>Board, has developed appropriate action plans to stabilise cane production and overall mill operations, 
<br/>while managing its debt through the support of Government.  The motion before the House today is an 
<br/>extension of constructive developments in the sugar industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the decision here is simple and necessary if you want to continue to see the continued 
<br/>growth and recovery of the sugar industry.  Global prices are favourable, which is a cause for optimism.  
<br/>With sugar export earnings clearly on the rise, now is the right time to make the right decision.  Let us 
<br/>not wait for the next global crisis to befall us and look back with regret.  Based on those important factors, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, do support the motion.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    before  I  get  on  to  some  of  the  issues 
<br/>specifically  about  the  motion  itself,  by  way  of  response  to  some  of  the  issues  that  were  raised  by 
<br/>honourable Members from the other side, honourable Kuridrani could not contain himself in a face-saving 
<br/>measure and harped onto yesterday’s right of reply because he, of course, could not move away from his 
<br/>nonsensical narrative.  On one hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he used today and said that the IMF and World 
<br/>Bank are predicting that the global growth rate will slow down.  But the same IMF and World Bank is 
<br/>predicting that Fiji will have double digit growth.  So, he chooses it when it suits him but he does not 
<br/></span><span>choose it when it does not suit him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the very kind of crass analysis of his, which is really what we call a 
<br/>characteristic of the other side, so they pick and choose.  The same organisation said, “Yes, there is a 
<br/>global slowdown”, the same organisation said we have double digit growth.  And then he uses USA 
<br/>saying, “USA will slow down significantly and how can Fiji grow if USA is going to slow down.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have to look at our major tourism source market, which is Australia.  After that, it is 
<br/>followed by New Zealand.  Australia, at this point in time, Sir, is, in fact, having what we call ‘nearly full 
<br/>employment’.  There is more work than actual people.  Why do you think they are taking people from 
<br/>Fiji?  If more and more Australians are being employed and are getting higher-paid jobs, they all want to 
<br/>come for holidays.  Where would they go to?  They will come to Fiji, and we have seen the numbers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go around to Denarau now, Sir, if you got to Sheraton, Hilton, Westin and to Radisson, 
<br/>bulk of the tourists are Australians.  So, again, it is a basic lack of understanding of the market, of how 
<br/>the tourism sector works and basic lack of understanding of how the global economy works, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that he also highlighted, Sir, was the debt per capita and he went on about that 
<br/>again.  We had completely explained that debt per capita of Australia is higher than Sri Lanka.  Is he 
<br/>saying, therefore, that Australia is a failed economy?  The debt per capita of Sudan is less than Australia.  
<br/>Does he say that Sudan has a great economy?  I had cleared all of this, yet he went on about it, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point that  I also wanted to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that he said that the GDP had 
<br/>declined, therefore, debt to GDP has declined.  Yes, of course, GDP declined.  The borders were shut 
<br/>down, there was economic contraction of 17.4 percent which we actually admitted to and that is what it 
<br/>was, Honourable Professor Prasad said that it does not really matter how it happened, but it happened in 
<br/>any case.  I had also addressed that, but he did not take that into account.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> However, honourable  Kuridrani also  said that we should  support  alternative livelihoods  and, 
<br/>therefore, that is how we revived the industry.  Alternative livelihoods means alternative to sugar, that is 
<br/>what it was all about.  The EU assistance was not about increasing sugarcane production, it was about 
<br/>alternative livelihoods for the non-performing sugarcane farmers - the people who are actually cutting 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>less sugarcane, and help the ones who can actually do a lot more harvesting.  It was alternative and also 
<br/>those who can increase.  So, again, he does not understand what he has been talking about, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would also  like to  talk about  the decline in  the number of  active  cane 
<br/>farmers.  From 1996 to 2006, active cane farmers declined by 5,090 farmers.  The number of active 
<br/>cane  farmers  declined  by  3,336  between  2006  and  2021.    In  other  words,  this  is  less  than  1,754 
<br/>farmers.  Far more farmers actually moved away from the sugarcane industry prior to 2007.  Between 
<br/>2006 and 2021, 3,336 actually moved away.  So, in other words, the cane farmer decline was at a 
<br/>much higher rate before 2007.  I want to get that right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, if we had not introduced the Committee on Better Utilisation of 
<br/>Land (CBUL), we would have seen a higher rate of reduction of cane farmers because the confidence 
<br/>of the sugar industry declined significantly in particular after 1987.  All you have to do is read Mr. 
<br/>Rabuka’s memoirs and in one of them, he actually mentions, “… because the sugarcane farmers after 
<br/>1987 decided to go on what we call a cane strike and they were forced to get into production.”  We 
<br/>know what  happened to  the cane farmers.  They  were forced to  go into cane production and Mr. 
<br/>Rabuka actually said, “This is their power-base, we must decline their power-base.” It is on record.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the average age of a cane farmer today is 59 years, and we all know that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The average size of cane farm is like 5 acres to 10 acres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Lalabalavu  and  honourable 
<br/>Bulanauca said, “Let us go to Queensland”.  The size of cane farms in Queensland is 123,000 acres 
<br/>and it is  all flat  land.    Those farms are, in  fact,  run by only two people or so,  and  everything is 
<br/>mechanised. The feeding is mechanised. It drip feeds, it comes on automatically at 6.00 p.m. or 6.00 
<br/>a.m,  the water  is  given,  the fertilizer, everything is  drip-fed  -  all high-end technology.  All  those 
<br/>farmers, yes, they have freehold land but you do not have to have freehold land, they can have 99 
<br/>year leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the fact is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is all flat land.  The fact is, it is highly mechanised. Only 
<br/>two people run the cane farm of few thousand acres. So, they need to know the point of difference.  
<br/>The reason I keep on emphasising flat land is because a lot of the cane farms (not most) in Fiji are 
<br/>actually not on flat land, they are on the sides of hills. That is why you cannot have the harvesters 
<br/>going on the sides of the hills and that is why, as honourable Vegnathan highlighted, we are using 
<br/>prisoners to cut cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No  one  wants  to  cut  cane  anymore.    People  used  to  come  from  Naitasiri,  Bua,  Yasawa, 
<br/>Tailevu, et  cetera, to  go  and cut  cane in  the West  and in  Macuata. They  do not  want  to  cut  cane 
<br/>anymore, they have other preferences in terms of their profession. So, we need the prisoners and we 
<br/>pay  them  money.    We  have  to  set  up  what  we  call,  Temporary  Correction  Centres  in  Tavua  and 
<br/>Rakiraki. So, rather than carting all these prisoners from Ba everyday, we set up temporary prison 
<br/>facilities during the sugarcane season.  We pay for that so that farmers can actually get access to 
<br/>labour.  That  is  how  rudimentary  our  sugarcane  industry  is,  compared  to  the  highly  mechanised 
<br/>industry in Queensland. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I also want to make, Sir, is that, all the sugarcane farmers in Queensland have 
<br/>access to commercial bank lending because they have freehold land and they have long leases.  No 
<br/>cane farmer in Fiji until recently under this Government, has received a 99 year lease.

<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  would  know  that  all 
<br/>Agricultural Landlord and Tenant's Ordinance (ALTO) and Agricultural and Landlord Tenants Act 
<br/>(ALTA) was all for 30 years.  So, every 30 years, we have this big negotiation in this Parliament, and 
<br/>that  is  what  they  call  the  bipartisan  thing.  That  was  the  negotiation.  “ALTO,  ALTA,  alright,  get 
<br/>another 30 years”, that was what it was.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is saying, “What is wrong with that”, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what a stupid comment!  What an obtuse comment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason is because when you have only short-term leases, commercial banks do not lend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Very simple!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Very simple - Maths.  You do not understand Commerce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make 
<br/>was that, as we highlighted previously, 43 percent of the cane farmers in Fiji cut less than 100 tonnes.  
<br/>For example, if I cut 100 tonnes I get $8,500 under the guaranteed price.  If I cut only 50 tonnes, I 
<br/>get half of that, in other words I get, $4,250.  You take out my expenses, I will probably get $2,500 
<br/>to $3,000 a year.  That is what a person is expected to live on.  That is with the guaranteed price. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assuming, Sir, and in fact prior to this Government, no government ever  gave  guaranteed 
<br/>price.  If they were left to the whims of the world market price, they would have made about $6,000.  
<br/>Then take off the expenses, they get $1,500 to $2,000 a year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have announced in the last Budget, we have said that we will help those farmers who 
<br/>no longer want to continue to do sugarcane farming, or if they want to get into other types of farming, 
<br/>or if they want to convert their leases to residential leases, we will help them.  We did the first round, 
<br/>we had 16 applications.  Majority of them said that they no longer want to do sugarcane farming.  
<br/>Majority of them said, “Please, simply cut less land (1 acre or 2 acres), we just want a residential 
<br/>lease for 99 years”.  That is all they want. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that,  the  attrition  rate  of  sugarcane  farmers  was  in  much  higher 
<br/>proportion in Vanua Levu.  That is why a lot of the cane production halved.  Yes, there are some 
<br/>good schemes at the moment at FSC in Vanua Levu where they partnered with the landowners.  I 
<br/>think they are cutting about 1,000 tonnes.  That is great.  We encourage that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FSC is actually working towards that, but to be able to say that will solve the problem, it 
<br/>will not.  If you want to look at the long-term basis, we need to ensure that we address these issues.  
<br/>These are real issues.  We need to have longevity of leases, we need to be able to ensure that we 
<br/>understand when we try and provide solutions that we have small farms.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  wanted  to  make  very  quickly,  honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau had mentioned about some Auditor-General’s Report on Ministry of Sugar.  If he actually 
<br/>delved deep into it, and that was why we objected to the Auditor-General at that point in time, Sir, is 
<br/>that they made those observations and normally when the Auditor-General supposedly picks up some 
<br/>anomalies, they go back to the Management to say, “Hey guys, this is what we have picked up, what 
<br/>is your response to that?”  They did not go back to Management, they simply just came to Parliament, 
<br/>published it and put it on the table.  You do not carry out professional audits in that way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  wanted  to  highlight  very  quickly  is  that, 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad mentioned about  the various CEOs.  Of course, the matter has been 
<br/>referred  to  FICAC,  they  are  carrying  out  their  job.    He  also  talked  about  the  farmers  becoming 
<br/>voiceless.    Sir,  the  sugarcane  farmers  actually  have  representations  on  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers 
<br/>Council.  They are, of course, selected.  Previously, as we have said, they used to have a “full-blown” 
<br/>elections.  There used to be the NFP camp, Labour camp and any other camp - that is what they want.  
<br/>Exorbitant costs!  Farmers’ hard earned savings was going in that, 36 people went on one overseas 
<br/>delegation because none of the parties wanted to be left out, Sir, all of those things happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Sir, what they actually failed to mention was that before, to actually fund the Sugar 
<br/></span><span>Cane Growers Council, funds used to be deducted from the cane farmers’ proceeds.  It no longer is - 
<br/></span><span>the Government provides the funding for the Cane Growers Council.  It does not come out from the 
<br/>cane farmers’ proceeds.  They do not mention that, Sir, not at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was that, honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad mentioned about  the shareholders.   I have got  the name of the farmer or shareholder who 
<br/>supposedly moved this legal matter.  There was a procedural issue that was raised and we will still 
<br/>go ahead with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Sir, Fijian Holdings and FNPF had agreed to sell their shares and I have got the figures 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here.   It says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Government made an offer to FNPF and Fijian Holdings, collectively referred to as 
<br/>the  parties,  by  a  letter  dated  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  March,  2020,  to  acquire  the  respective  parties’  full 
<br/>shareholding  in  FSC  with  an  offer  price  of  0.05  per  share.    Both  parties  accepted 
<br/>Government’s offer by a letter of acceptance dated 24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2020 and 26</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2020 
<br/>respectively.  The offer price of 0.005 per share was benchmarked from FSC’s Valuation 
<br/>Report by Siemens Corporate Finance dated June 2019.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We did not pull it out of some part of our anatomy, it was done independently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Accordingly, the Government was going to acquire 8.86 percent of Fijian Holdings’ 
<br/>shareholding  and  17.5  percent  of  FNPF  shareholding  in  FSC  by  a  Sale  and  Purchase 
<br/>Agreement on 21</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2020 at a share price of 0.005 per share.  The sale proceeds of 
<br/>$19,669.50 for 3,393,900 shares and $39,054 for 7.8 million shares was paid to FHCL and 
<br/>FNPF respectively in exchange for the respective companies’ Share Certificates.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  then  one  of  the  minority  shareholders  who  had  one  law  firm  and  we 
<br/>probably know who they are, to take this matter to Court which is why honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/>is speaking so passionately about that.  A lady by the name of Seravina Lutu who took to Court and 
<br/>now, of course, the Court has directed that certain procedural matters need to be adhered to which 
<br/>the Permanent Secretary for Economy is doing so and those shares will actually be transferred to the 
<br/>Government.    Therefore,  Government  can  then  offer  to  all  the  other  shareholders  through  the 
<br/>Companies  Act,  Sir.    That  is  the  procedure.    Then,  of  course,  we  can  do  the  debt-to-equity

<div><span>contribution.  Someone mentioned that it has already been done, but it has not been done.  We can 
<br/>only do so once we actually have the shareholding intact, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I would like to re-echo the sentiments of the other speakers, including 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister, that in the analysis of FSC and, indeed, the overall observations by 
<br/>honourable  Members  in  particular  from  the  other  side  saying  that  the  sugarcane  production  has 
<br/>reduced significantly, have really not take into account the fact that we had 14 cyclones since 2016.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has a huge impact, Sir, and as we know sugarcane is very vulnerable to high winds and in 
<br/>particular, flooding. It is not like coconut trees. These things become flattened when you have high 
<br/>winds, so it had a huge impact on it, that is why talk about climate change.  In any analysis of it, we 
<br/>need  to  be  able  to  understand  that  these  were  the  ground  realities.  We  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>Opposition, whilst they came to support the motion and had a fairly convoluted and distorted take on 
<br/>the facts, they still support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to thank everyone who is 
<br/>actually going to support this motion. We hope, God willing,  this will actually solve some of the 
<br/>fundamental of what we call, the ‘balance sheet’ problems with FSC’s books.  We will be able to get 
<br/>more private sector participation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Naulumatua, I think, made one of the most definitive contributions to all of this 
<br/>debate where she talked about how the private sector - in fact, if the Members looked at it carefully, 
<br/>funding for SRIF has increased significantly.  Also, because they are working with organisations like 
<br/>hers, private sector where we are looking at increasing the yield.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, none of the honourable Members from the other side actually talked about 
<br/>the fact that yields from ratoons have been dropping significantly.  Why? Because the same ratoons 
<br/>have been used for nearly two decades.  Many cane-growing countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not have 
<br/>the same ratoons growing for two decades. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point they all need to understand is that, at the moment, the sugar 
<br/>industry in Fiji is protected. There is a 32 percent duty on imported sugar.  If tomorrow we were to 
<br/>bring it down to 5 percent, you will be able to get cheaper sugar from overseas than the Fijian sugar.  
<br/>The industry is protected, so that everyone who goes to the shop will buy Fijian sugar.  You can get 
<br/>cheaper sugar from overseas.  Why is it cheaper from overseas?  Because it has got higher yields, it 
<br/>has got lot more production, so they are able to sell it for a cheaper price. All of those dynamics do 
<br/>exist, Sir.  When honourable Members say, “Aw, members of the public are paying a high price, et 
<br/>cetera,” they need to know that it is a protected industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  those  remarks,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  honourable  Members  for 
<br/></span></div>
