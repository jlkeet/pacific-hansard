<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  two  motions  relating  to 
<br/>Programme  1-1-5(8)  –  Public  Service  Broadcast  [TV]  ($3,766,668)  and  (9)  -  Public  Service 
<br/>Broadcast [Radio] ($6,677,400).   I have noted it to you separately, however, I could combine them 
<br/>if you wish because they are both related to the same entity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will take one at a time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That SEG 5(8) – Public Service Broadcast [T] be decreased by $3 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, this is pretty much the same argument 
<br/>for  both  SEG  5  (8)  and  (9).    Fiji  Broadcasting  Corporation  (FBC)  owes  the  people  of  Fiji  an 
<br/>explanation in terms of the funds that had been allocated to it from 2017.  We consider this a wilful 
<br/></span><span>dinau</span><span> or debt to the people, through Parliament, and it is unbeknown that an entity that is funded by 
<br/>the people of Fiji does not report to it for a very long time so we cannot continue to give funds to it 
<br/>if it cannot  comply  or report to  the people through Parliament.   Therefore,  I recommend that  the 
<br/>allocation for SEG 5(8) which is for Public Service Broadcast [TV] be reduced by $3 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  we  have  been  down  this  track  before.    This  is  just  a 
<br/>political gimmick for them.  Essentially, they are saying that there is no reporting.  Annual reports of 
<br/>FBC are presented to Parliament, the Committees actually go through it so I do not know what he is 
<br/>harping on about.  Again, misleading Parliament, but as we have said, we have exhausted this topic 
<br/>on a number of occasions and explained the reason why, so we do not need to explain any further.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman,  I speak in support of the motion to reduce the 
<br/>allocation to Public Service Broadcast [TV].  Sir, as we understand, FBC TV have taken out a loan 
<br/>from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB).  We have been running with it and they have been funded, 
<br/>as explained, from public funds for the last few years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have here a total of more than $10 million so the question is, when will it run as a business 
<br/>entity because it is depending on Government public funds to survive and it has been doing that since it 
<br/>was established?  That is the question we would like to ask.  When it will run as a business? At the 
<br/>moment, it is subsidised by the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue is, you have explained the public services to the people and my question is, what 
<br/>is the monetary value of these services and also in terms of the value or quality of what is being delivered? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That needs to be clearly determined.  Why has this not been tendered out because there are other service 
<br/>providers who can do this?  That is my contribution, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I  feel I have to respond to honourable Tuisawau because 
<br/>he is actually a hypocrite. He has sat on the Committee when FBC appeared before it.  He knows full 
<br/>well that the value of air time that we get for public service broadcast is worth over $20 million.  He 
<br/>knows that, it is in the Committee Report.  And he knows that when you run a business like a radio TV, 
<br/>the air time is your real state - that is your business.  He is, again, saying, “Oh, we do not know about 
<br/>this.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  also  knows  there  is  only  one  radio  station  (company)  in  Fiji  that  provides  Amplitude 
<br/>Modulation  (AM)  services.    No  other  station  provides  AM  services.  So,  if  you  want  to  do  public 
<br/>broadcast, you are saying, “Let us give it to CFL”, which is your recent lackey of you people. We give it 
<br/>to them so that the people in Lau will not get to hear them. We are now trying to invest in  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> so 
<br/>Frequency Modulation (FM) can be available to everyone which will include CFL and other stations. In 
<br/>the meantime, it is only AM.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone knows that AM travels better over water over long distances.  An AM antenna as you 
<br/></span><span>should know by now if you are sitting in the Committee and I hope you have been to Naulu where their 
<br/></span><span>actual antenna is actually in the ground, it needs wet soil to transmit better, to get to Southern Lau, Rotuma 
<br/>and Cikobia.  Despite knowing those facts, all of you are here harping on about the same thing, even 
<br/>though the facts are staring in your face because you see that as some kind of political too. That is what 
<br/>you are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Tikoduadua  says,  “No  accountability”.    Annual  Reports  are  presented  to  this 
<br/>Parliament. You sit on that Committee, yet despite that you keep on doing that, and update yourself.  For 
<br/>example, Honourable Qereqeretabua got it wrong the other day that Annual Reports are more up to date 
<br/>and honourable Salote Radrodro.  Check that before you come and say those things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, again, the value that we are getting from this is far more.  How can we go and 
<br/>force other radio stations to put AM.  It cost millions of dollars to put AM Stations. You are not putting 
<br/>into perspective what used to happen with FBC before that.  What happened in 2002 or 2001?  How 
<br/>much money went down the gurgler?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, just to respond to the honourable Minister is saying, 
<br/>‘value for money’. That is why I am saying that we are talking about TV here, not the radio, and that is 
<br/>what we are debating on which is the subject of the motion, that there is another TV station and that 
<br/>should be tendered out so that we see in terms of value for money whether the public funds which are 
<br/>being used by FBC TV is worth what he is saying. That is exactly what I was saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  is  saying  that  the  value  of  that  has  been  presented  to  the  Committee.  That  value  is  the 
<br/>perspective of the FBC Executives, it is not the perspective of someone who is independently assessing 
<br/>the value.  That is another issue which needs to be cleared out. Let us do an independent evaluation of 
<br/>the services provided and tender it out and see who would be the best to provide the services which we 
<br/>are describing at SEG 5(8) which is TV.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  the  major  concern  here  is  that,  FBC  has  been  used  as  a  propaganda  tool  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government in terms of its election campaign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What is he saying?  You are a twisted man.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- The biasness is there and that is a concern, so let us have an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1835 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>independent evaluation, tender it out so that all the other providers have an opportunity and, in fact, there 
<br/>should be an independent review of FBC, whether it is really independent.  That is what we are concerned 
<br/>about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I can hear  you comment,  I can comment twice,  it is in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, again, he obfuscates the issue.  Everyone knows that radio programmes are 
<br/>also  broadcasted  on  television.    You  go  on  the  RF1  station,  you  go  on  the  RF2  station,  it  is  also 
<br/>broadcasted on television - the public service broadcast time.  You know that too, and you are saying, 
<br/>“Oh, that is a perspective.”  It is very easily ascertainable what the market value is.  You just need to go 
<br/>and look at the advertising rates.  That has also been presented to you.  Do not come and give all these 
<br/>skewed perspective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- It is tendered by them, not independent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is very easy.  Go today and ask, how much is someone going 
<br/>to sell your 30 seconds spot for?  How much is someone going to sell a one minute spot to you for?  Very 
<br/></span><span>easily to ascertain!   And you then do your calculations.  I know maths is not your strong point.  Just 
<br/></span><span>multiply that by the number of hours and then you get the volume and get the value. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- We are suggesting for it to be independently assessed.  But to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provided by them, that is what I am asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You can go and do it yourself.  Why did the Committee not do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Why should I go and do it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Because you are the one questioning it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- You should do it, you are the Minister.  Why should I do it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We have already done it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Why should I go and do it?  It is not my job.  You are being paid to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do not talk amongst yourselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are a bitter man, that is why you have a problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- No, you are a bitter man, not me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are extremely bitter and you are an extremist. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- That is why you paid your brother the compensation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are an extremist, that is your problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Why did you pay him the bonus of $20,000?  That is the problem.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Let us move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The honourable Attorney-General has 
<br/>got a bad habit of calling people names.  He calls me “twisted”, I can call him many names but I will not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The subject that we are debating right now is the allocation for a public broadcaster TV and the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General knows.  That is what the mover of the motion is saying, ‘value for money’.  
<br/>In any country, any democracy, a public broadcaster funded by the taxpayers of that country will practise 
<br/>ethical and honest journalism.  You know that they do not!  That is why, Mr. Chairman, I do not talk to 
<br/>FBC.  I know what happens there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  go  to  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  you  can  imagine  the  Australian  Broadcasting 
<br/>Corporation (ABC) or the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which is funded by the taxpayers, 
<br/>you expect them to be ethical.  I do not care who runs the station or who is the CEO, that is not an issue 
<br/>for me and I have no problems with that but the problem I have is the practice  - the value for money 
<br/>because people out there, the taxpayers of this country expect a fair coverage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone in this country knows what FBC does in terms of its news coverage.  The people out 
<br/></span><span>there know, the women and children now know, that it is a government propaganda outlet funded by the 
<br/></span><span>taxpayers.  Mr. Chairman, </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> does not get any money from Government, CFL does not get any 
<br/>money from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Therefore, it can be biased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You said CFL is a lackey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Of course, it is.  Yours! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well, you can say it outside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I said it, I have already said it this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because they tell the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They give you a balanced coverage, that is a standard.  Actually, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are setting the standard of fair ethical journalism.  You know that, do not laugh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are a joke! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are a complete joke when it comes to understanding this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Come up with something original!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is original, this is about democracy, this is about good use of 
<br/>taxpayers’ funds.  Honourable Attorney-General, you have to understand that for once.  I do not mind if 
<br/>Government gets the coverage.  Mr. Chairman, </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> gives you more coverage than probably they 
<br/>do to us sometimes.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1837 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What kind of coverage? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are practicing ethical, fair and balanced journalism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Pigs are flying outside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  why  we  have  problems  in  this  Parliament,  approving 
<br/>anything for this public broadcaster. They must come out openly, publicly, and I have told them that I 
<br/>will only talk if you come out openly, publicly and, at least, say that you are going to be balanced, that 
<br/>you are going to be fair.  Whether you do it or not, at least, say it because you are funded by the taxpayers 
<br/>of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What’s wrong with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They expect you to be balanced.  That is what I am saying, you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not know anything about it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I find this quite interesting. We would all 
<br/>recall  that  two  Budgets  ago,  the  honourable  Leader  of  SODELPA  moved  a  motion  to  increase  the 
<br/>allocation given to FBC after hearing the work that they did during Committee.  He was so impressed 
<br/>and he argued in this august Parliament that they are not given the allocation that is due to the organisation.  
<br/>As already alluded to, the cost of their services for air time is worth around $20 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, from the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) particularly, when 
<br/>it comes to disasters, tsunamis, et cetera, and when we want to send information and alert our people, this 
<br/>is the only form of communication that we have with rural Fiji, particularly the people out there in the 
<br/>outer islands.  The question has been asked, when can it run as a full commercial entity?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, that does not take away the fact that we want it to, at least, break even in terms of 
<br/>its costing but let us not forget Government’s social responsibility as well.  As much as we want FBC to 
<br/>operate as a commercial entity, unfortunately, it is only Government that at times in some of the services 
<br/>that if offers, can operate at a loss because of its social responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have talked about the Lau Group this morning, Mr. Chairman. Honourable Jale was talking 
<br/>about improving shipping services.  Lau, in the last Provincial Council meeting in the analysis that was 
<br/>undertaken by the Ministries involved, there are only 11 percent of Lauans in Lau.  We are all concerned 
<br/>about the rural-urban migration, Mr. Chairman, Sir, but they are still citizens of this country.  Of course, 
<br/>we  have  to  reach  out  to  them  so  that  no  one  is  left  behind  and  that  is  the  social  responsibility  of 
<br/>Government.  In instances as such, it needs to be funded by the taxpayers of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I find it strange, Mr. Chairman, because when they appeared before the Committee a few 
<br/>years ago, unfortunately, the honourable Gavoka is not here, he was the one that moved in this Chamber 
<br/>that they are underfunded and they need more funds, but we all know where all these arguments are 
<br/>coming from.  We get the CEO out of this organisation and I think this will not come up again because it 
<br/>is being personalised, unfortunately.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Tikoduadua ,you have the floor for your right of reply. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Members who have 
<br/>contributed to this motion.  Unfortunately, it has, kind of, wandered off from the heart of what is being 
<br/>proposed in the motion here and the reason why we need to reduce Public Service Broadcast [TV] by $3 
<br/>million and, that is, purely because FBC has not submitted a report to Parliament since 2017.  Yes, it has 
<br/>been submitting reports, but it is not up-to-date.  In that regard we are moving this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise the services that it is providing to the nation, as rightfully pointed out by honourable 
<br/>Seruiratu, though it may not be profitable at times, it is the Government’s responsibility and that is alright.  
<br/>The reporting procedure is a requirement for every Government Department and Ministry that needs to 
<br/>report to Parliament, and that is the point of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Professor Prasad said, we are also concerned in terms of the biasness and unethical 
<br/>journalism that we often experience from FBC in that regard.  That is my concluding remark to that, Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, and it will be my same remark as well in terms of SEG 5(9).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I now give the floor to honourable Tuisawau.  I am coming to your second 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion after this.  You have had enough air time so far.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO  F. TUISAWAU.-  Mr. Chairman,  I  withdraw the motion because it is of  a similar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nature.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I think, much of our debate on the last 
<br/>motion had contributions into SEG 5(9) as well, and I will take my guidance from you.  But the motion 
<br/>is there, a reduction of that SEG by $6 million, subsequently reducing Head 50 in that regard for the 
<br/>various notes that have already been made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, I think the contributions by honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad and honourable Tuisawau, essentially captured what honourable Seruiratu said.  One said it is 
<br/>because  of  my  brother  and  honourable  Professor  Prasad  said  it  is  because  that  he  feels  the  media 
<br/>organisation is biased, and that is why.  Both of those issues, in fact, negate the point that has been made, 
<br/>in  that,  they  are  providing  a  particular  service  which  actually  comes  at  a  cost,  and  the  cost  that 
<br/>Government is paying is far less than what we are actually getting in return.  Fundamentally, that is the 
<br/>issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole rationale of honourable Professor Prasad opposing this is because he thinks they are 
<br/>biased and that is precisely the point we have been making - that when anything is reported or any decision 
<br/>that does not go their way, then that organisation, person or institution is, therefore, biased.  That is their 
<br/>rationale.  Anything is only fair or independent if it says something that they agree with, and that is their 
<br/>rationale, in anything that they are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, I, again, wish to highlight the point that this is about radio and there are many 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>radio services but the only AM radio service provided in Fiji is through FBC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the annual report, honourable Tikoduadua has not taken that supposed principled position.  In 
<br/>other organisations where annual reports are still coming and they are funded by taxpayers of Fiji, we 
<br/>have not said to reduce their funding.  Many organisations that we have done and we give grants to, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1839 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have not said, “Let us cut their funding until we get all their annual accounts as long as it is up-to-date 
<br/>then we will do it.”  So, it is not a principled position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  rationale,  therefore,  is  not  a  principled  position.    There  are  other 
<br/>organisations here whose Annual Reports are far behind, but they have not stood up and said, “Let us put 
<br/>their funding on hold, even though we know they are doing a good job, wait until we get their Annual 
<br/>Reports, then we will do it.”  That is precisely what he said, Sir.  The rationale for this, obviously, is that 
<br/>it is all very politically motivated.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the honourable Attorney-General has the gift of the gab to 
<br/>exaggerate and twist and turn the intentions of the motion. We have, in this Parliament, Mr. Chairman, 
<br/>you know, raised the issue of Annual Reports for every entity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- But you have not asked for the funding to be put on hold, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, in many cases, we did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Not today, not yesterday, you did not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You know that.  It is a flimsy, kind of, argument that he is putting 
<br/>to hide the substantial point that we are making about the use of the taxpayers’ funds to buy this particular 
<br/>organisation to be a Government mouthpiece. That is what we are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  still  want  to  go  back  to  this  AM 
<br/>frequency that the public service broadcast is involved in and  that is why I am worried about reducing 
<br/>or taking away the allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the Ministry of Rural Development and National Disaster Management Office, let me take 
<br/>back the honourable Members to this issue.  They want to take away this service because it does not bring 
<br/>any profit to them but when it comes to warning systems, early warning systems is high on the agenda of 
<br/>the Sendai Framework which is Disaster Risk Reduction because we need to reach out to all our people.  
<br/>We have to go back to Naulu and even find some of the old staff from FBC who knew the background 
<br/>behind this AM radio station.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, because they are funded by taxpayers’ money, they were willing to take back 
<br/>this service, but we are thankful that the Japanese Government came to our assistance.  It was funded by 
<br/>the Japanese Government to have the systems back on and then included as part of the services provided 
<br/>by FBC because they were not willing to take it up.  This is the social responsibility that I am talking 
<br/>about and I am sure that from a commercial perspective, there is no service provider that is willing to take 
<br/>this if there is no return or profit and, again, let us value lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whether it is used for political agenda or whatever, according to some people, but this is the only 
<br/>means of communication that reaches out to the remote of the remotest in Fiji - the extreme rural.  It is 
<br/>not only about warning assistance or whatever, everyone is looking forward to when the ship next arrives 
<br/>into the other islands - all the information.  When we have Provincial Council meetings, this is the way 
<br/>we communicate to most of our people in the rural areas and if we take this out, how can we be able to 
<br/>provide this service?  It is not logical.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, FBC is providing an important function for the nation 
<br/>and as the honourable Minister has highlighted, it is to reach out to the people who are living in the rural 
<br/>and remote areas.  But I can tell you, Sir, during COVID-19 when schools were closed down, that was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>1840 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one of the ways in which we were able to teach our students. We were able to not only broadcast certain 
<br/>lessons for our children and prepare them during that period, but also needed help from FBC to prepare 
<br/>information that was broadcasted on the Education Channel and that helped Year 12 and 13 students to 
<br/>prepare for their exams.  So, they provide a very valuable service and I do not see any reason why we 
<br/>should be reducing the budget here.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Chairman, the work done by FBC, specifically during the 
<br/>COVID-19 outbreak has been very helpful to us.  As alluded to by the honourable Minister for Economy 
<br/>and also my colleagues, it is comprehensive and above and beyond what we would normally pay.  As 
<br/>you know, it was a very fluid time, there were decisions that were made on the go and we contacted the 
<br/>Ministry of Information very quickly and made sure that information went out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also interesting to note, Sir, that despite AM being only available in the outer islands, quite a 
<br/>significant number of people in Viti Levu and Vanua  Levu, who were within reach of the FM radio 
<br/>frequency, still choose the AM radio of Radio Fiji One and Radio Fiji Two as their primary source of 
<br/>information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have a significant number of people that we do know because we had to do a research 
<br/></span><span>before we actually use whatever media.  We know that a significant number of people who actually watch 
<br/></span><span>FBC TV and the many other channels that they have - FBC Sports</span><span>,</span><span> for example.  We know that a lot of 
<br/>us here in this room love rugby and that comes through the FBC Sports Channels.  For example, the 
<br/>Skipper Cup, I know a lot of you here have been following the Skipper Cup which is aired through the 
<br/>FBC Sports channel, but that is diverting away from the health part.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we did realise was that, we could quickly get information out to everyone through the many 
<br/>forms of media that FBC had, whether it be AM radio to the people in the rural and maritime areas or 
<br/>even AM radio to those who choose to listen to AM radio within Viti Levu where the scope of FM radio 
<br/>was available.  That is why the continued support towards FBC.  </span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thank honourable Members 
<br/>for their contribution.  I think we recognise the importance of the services provided by public service 
<br/>broadcast, but that is not the only issue here which seems to be the main argument of the other side 
<br/>whether funds should be granted, and so should it be granted.  But my point here is that FBC, which is 
<br/>the user of these funds, is not being accountable to Parliament which is giving it the money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Well,  it  means  that  they  should  be  accountable.    They 
<br/>have been behind by five years of report and this Parliament should know, and like every other essential 
<br/>service such as health and every other service going out to the outer islands, it is accountable to the people.  
<br/>That is the point we are making.  Therefore, we stand by this recommendation that has been made under 
<br/>this motion, Mr. Chairman.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, this is in relation to SEG 6(4) - South Pacific 
<br/>Stock Exchange - Operating Grant ($320,000).  I just want to further note, Mr. Chairman, that the Stock 
<br/>Exchange’s 2021 Annual Report on the South Pacific Stock Exchange website highlights that the Deputy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1841 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chairperson, Mr. Saiyad Hussain, is presenting the 2021 Report as the Deputy Chairperson.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just have two questions for the honourable Minister: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>What has happened to the substantive chairperson of the South Pacific Stock Exchange that 
<br/>prevented him or her for not publically signing off on the last year’s Annual Report? 
<br/>The South Pacific Stock Exchange’s Annual Report, are they not supposed to be presented 
<br/>to Parliament, given that these funds are to be allocated to them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I understand South Pacific Stock Exchange is actually 
<br/>regulated not by us but regulated by the Reserve Bank of Fiji  (RBF).  The RBF is the one that chooses 
<br/>the  board  members,  chairman  and  deputy  chairperson,  et  cetera,  and  I  can  find  out  why?  But  I 
<br/>understand that the Chairman’s position has expired and they have a limited term of numbers that 
<br/>they can be chair for.  I think it is on a limited term so I think that term has finished so that is why 
<br/>the Deputy Chairperson is signing, so let us get rid of your conspiratorial theory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The South Pacific Stock Exchange is actually owned by different private entities. This is a 
<br/>setup that we inherited from the previous Government.  Sir, BSP and various other organisations are 
<br/></span><span>actually  shareholders  in  it.    We  provide  the  funding  because,  obviously,  it  is  in  the  interest  of 
<br/></span><span>Government to have capital markets.  If the capital market does not exist, then we cannot have listed 
<br/>companies.  Fijian Holdings will not be listed as a listed company.   Many companies will not be 
<br/>listed in the South Pacific Stock Exchange. It is the only viable stock exchange in the Pacific. The 
<br/>other stock exchange is in Papua New Guinea, no other stock exchange exists.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notwithstanding the fact that, I think, some people made some negative comments about it, 
<br/>we have had some interests in it.  There is currently some work being done to see how we can list 
<br/>Micro Small Enterprises.  Countries like Bangladesh, for example, have been able to do that. We 
<br/>have EFL shares that are held by members of the Fijian public (account holders) and we have said 
<br/>that we will fully list EFL on the South Pacific Stock Exchange and all those who earn  less than 
<br/>$30,000 a year have been given 250 shares. Those who earn more than that and I am talking about 
<br/>domestic account holders, have got 150 shares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is in the interest of any country to have a capital market and this funding is there for 
<br/>that, Sir. I can give you a breakdown of that. There is an Electronic Trading Platform - $108,000; 
<br/>Investor Awareness Activities - $100,000; Training and Development - $64,000; Listing Campaign 
<br/>and  Product  Diversity  -  $25,000;  Legal  Compliance  Expenses  -  $10,000;  and  Technological 
<br/>Progression - $10,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S. QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr. Chairman,  I have another question on SEG 6 (5) - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>World Bank Subscription of $4,675,000.  Could the honourable Minister explain this, please?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, as you know that we are a member of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>World Bank, there are two components for the World Bank subscription:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Subscription; and 
<br/>International Finance Corporation Subscription.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018, the World Bank endorsed an ambition package of measures that include a US$13 
<br/>billion paid-up capital increases.  We are shareholders. Countries that actually borrow from World 
<br/>Bank are actually shareholders, so there was an increase in a paid-up capital, I hope the honourable 
<br/>Member knows what that means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>1842 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this capital increase, the combined financing arms of the World Bank are expected to 
<br/>reach an average annual capacity of nearly $100 billion from 2019 to 2030, benefitting all bank group 
<br/>members across the income spectrum.  The World Bank has allocated shares to its members based 
<br/>on the size of the economy or GDP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has been allocated paid-in capital shares for International Bank for Reconstruction and 
<br/>Development  (IBRD)  and  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC).  The  total  IBRD  and  IFC 
<br/>subscription is around $10.8 million which is required to be paid over a period of three to five years.  
<br/>Allocation for first payment has been provided in the 2021-2022 Budget. The estimate of $4.7 million 
<br/>includes the second year of subscription, amounting to US$1.9 million which is about FJ$4.2 million 
<br/>to IBRD and IFC and the note encashment of FJ$467,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The slight increase, Sir, is to meet the shortfall in the second-year subscription payment of 
<br/>shares allocated to Fiji with IBRD and IFC and the fourth payment for the note encashment.  So, 
<br/>when the Ratu Mara Government joined, they also paid subscription, as we all pay subscription, and 
<br/>when there is an increase in the paid-up capital, all members have to contribute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, on Head 50-1-1-7(2),  I would like to move 
<br/></span><span>that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Sub-SEG be decreased by $4.5 million in respect of “Contingency provision for 
<br/>unforeseen  expenses  (Operating/Capital)  including  legal  and  administrative  expenses  of 
<br/>capital projects, etc”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I second, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I know that Sub-SEG 2 has a $5 million 
<br/>allocation  tucked away under the heading of General Reserve - Operating and Capital, but in the 
<br/>details on the next page, it says that this $5 million is, as I have said, a “contingency provision for 
<br/>unforeseen expenses”, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At a time when this Government is asking the most vulnerable of our taxpayers to make do 
<br/>with what we have heard from the honourable Minister for Economy on Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022, it 
<br/>rewards  itself  with  probably  another  slush  fund  as  what  I  suspect,  to  play  around  with,  if  the 
<br/>Ministers responsible have not done proper due diligence within their own Ministries to pre-empt 
<br/>budget blowouts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, this $5 million allocation rewards bad accountability and it rewards incompetent 
<br/>risk mitigating planning.  It is just plain arrogance, in my view, that our most vulnerable taxpayers 
<br/>have  to  deny  themselves  the  ability  to  feed  their  families  with  dignity  while  poor  planning  and 
<br/>incompetent oversight by Ministers get rewarded by a $5 million safety net. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  very  tedious,  actually,  to  try  and 
<br/>respond to conspiracy.  Sir, under SEG 7(2) it says, “Contingency provision for unforeseen expenses 
<br/>(Operating/Capital)”, which may also include (does not mean limited to) legal and administrative 
<br/>expenses of capital projects.  For example, sometimes when we do capital projects, there could be 
<br/>some unforeseen legal administrative issues that may arise.  For example, with Blackrock, those 
<br/>who did the planning, et cetera, it was discovered that we had to build additional sewerage systems, 
<br/>it was not in the overall scope of the works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua, I think it was yesterday or today, wanted to increase for NDMO 
<br/>saying that $0.5 million for relief is not enough.  Let us increase it to “x” number of million dollars, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1843 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we did point out to her that there is about over $3 million in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.  
<br/>If, for example, we require more money than that, this contingency fund can be used for that.  It is 
<br/>what you call a “General Reserve for Operating Capital”.  She does not understand that, Sir.  They 
<br/>think everything is some kind of conspiracy, they think we are going to use this $5 million to go 
<br/>and,  as  her  Leader  says  “buy  votes”.    No,  if  you  look  at  the  historical  expenditure  of  General 
<br/>Reserve, it is for specific unanticipated costs.  Any good government will do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lalabalavu will testify to that, he has been in previous Governments before.  For 
<br/>example, we have had situations where we have had to hold a State funeral where someone dies and 
<br/>we have to pay for that.  We do not put in the budget, “Oh, the death of the President or death of a 
<br/>former President and this is the expenditure.”  Where does the money come from?  It comes from 
<br/>this General Reserve, it is unanticipated cost.  That is what it is all about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General has not picked any issue with this.  She cannot point to there any issue 
<br/>that the Auditor-General has picked up with this particular SEG (SEG 7) and to do with Expenditure 
<br/>2.    Nothing!    Just  going  on  and  on  about  something  that  is  completely  irrelevant.  Any  prudent 
<br/>government will have a contingency fund, and that is precisely what it is there for.  Sir, we have not 
<br/>spent this money in the past when it has not been required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You have the floor for your Right of Reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Thank  you  for  the  answer,  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy.  I just wanted to end by saying, those snide and condescending remarks just do not earn 
<br/>you any fans.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on this motion that Head 50 be 
<br/>decreased  by  $4.5  million  in  Programme  1-1-7(2)  with  respect  to  Contingency  provision  for 
<br/>unforeseen expenses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I would just like to raise a question 
<br/>with the honourable Minister with regards to SEG 7(5). The question is, what kind of Government 
<br/>awareness is this for when other Heads, including Communications, already have allocations for their 
<br/>awareness by Ministry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  this  a  modest  sum  of  $50,000  which  is  generally  a 
<br/>central  pool  for  the  Ministries  and  Departments  to  promote  and  create  awareness  on  Ministry’s 
<br/>policies and services.  So this is something new being rolled out, for example, inflation mitigation.  
<br/>We have to go out and make the public aware of it as to how they can access to it, what they can do 
<br/>so that, of course, involves public awareness.  We may need to have meetings, we may need to go 
<br/>out to rural areas to tell members of the public how they can apply if they have children, if they are 
<br/>not in school, how they can apply, so that is what it is essentially for – for Government policies by 
<br/>various Ministries and Departments to promote awareness of their respective policies and services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I do not have any other questions.  I am 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdrawing my motion as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 50 – Miscellaneous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Services.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 50 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  please,  take  note  that  Heads  51  and  52  are 
<br/>standing  appropriations  or  below  the  line  appropriations.    Head  51  lists  all  the  pensions  that  are 
<br/>payable. These are charges on Government finances. Head 52 are charges on account of public debt. 
<br/>Those numerous pages lists all the information on interest and loans. Neither Head is voted upon 
<br/>because they must be paid and are, therefore, already catered for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the Estimates. We shall now proceed to 
<br/>consider the Schedules and Clauses of the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 (Bill No. 27/2022), as 
<br/>required by Standing Order 101.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I advise that as we have not amended the Estimates, Standing Order 
<br/>101 prevents any amendments being moved and made at this stage.    Standing Order 101(3) also 
<br/>prevents any debate on these questions.  I hope that is clear to everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Schedules 1 and 2, Clauses 1, 2, 3 and title and enacting clause agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 (Bill No. 27 of 2022), be read a third time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and do pass.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on the third reading of the

<div><span>Honourable Members, Parliament has now passed the 2022-2023 National Budget.  As I had

<br/>constitutional obligation.  On that note, I take this opportunity to thank all honourable Members for 
<br/>your contributions during this integral process.  I also congratulate the honourable Attorney-General

<br/>on the successful passing of the 2022-2023 National Budget.  Thank you, honourable Members.
