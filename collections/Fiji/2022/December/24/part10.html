<br/>that has become an embodiment of his chiefly role.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  all  those  tuning  in  from  the 
<br/>comfort of their homes, as your elected Speaker, first and foremost, I thank the Almighty God for 
<br/>this great honour bestowed upon me.  I must sincerely thank the honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/>for the trust and confidence placed on me to serve this august Parliament as your Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, allow me to congratulate you again individually and collectively for 
<br/>your successful elections to this august Parliament.  I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the 
<br/>support afforded to me by my family, and like all families, they are a pillar of strength and a never-
<br/>ending source of support and motivation and  I thank you most sincerely for your unwavering support 
<br/>through the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must also sincerely thank the Secretary-General to Parliament for her team of dedicated staff 
<br/>who, under immense pressure and public scrutiny, have heeded the call of duty to ensure that all the 
<br/>necessary services  of Parliament are up to  the professional  standards demanded by such a higher 
<br/>office.  I dearly acknowledge their steadfast dedication to ensure the necessary services and processes 
<br/>of Parliament are given due consideration without fear or favour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  Chair  is  not  a  prestigious  or  glamorous  one,  but  one  that  is 
<br/>burdened with the high level of responsibility and due diligence since it requires a constant devotion 
<br/>to the roles and principles of parliamentary democracy.  I commend the Fijian Elections Office and 
<br/>the Electoral Commission for their successful completion of the Election process that has afforded 
<br/>all Fijians the right to vote for their representative in Parliament, and I must thank all Fijians who 
<br/>had rightfully and dutifully exercised this right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we may have many new and young Members entering Parliament for the first time, I 
<br/></span><span>also  notice  the  reduction  of  the  number  of  women  representatives.    From  the  largest  ever 
<br/></span><span>representation of 10 women MPs in 2018 to a low of six in 2022.  I sincerely hope that this is an 
<br/>important challenge that we, as decision makers and as a nation, can collectively strive to rectify.  
<br/>But I must acknowledge the efforts of the six brave women who have successfully made it to a space 
<br/>that is already dominated by men.  We must also pay all due respect to the courageous women who 
<br/>had put up their hands to be candidates but were unable to join their colleagues in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Election of Deputy Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we could have done better, it is still truly a remarkable demonstration of confidence 
<br/>of our often-conservative society, especially when women are seen as serious decision makers and 
<br/>very important national leaders.  At this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of 
<br/>our development partners who, despite the challenges of the pandemic-ridden world, have given their 
<br/>support  towards  the  strengthening  of  parliamentary  democracy  in  Fiji.    I  sincerely  thank  the 
<br/>continuous support and assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through 
<br/>the  Fiji  Parliament  Support  Project,  and  I  extend  my  utmost  gratitude  to  the  Governments  of 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, for their continuous support to the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  extend  my  utmost  gratitude  to  our  Inter-Parliamentary  friends  for  their  unabated 
<br/>commitment to helping us build and strengthen our democratic institution.  They include the Inter-
<br/>Parliamentary  Union  (IPU);  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association  (CPA);  our  twinning 
<br/>Parliaments  of  Victoria,  Australia;  and  our  Inter-Parliamentary  partners,  who  have  supported  our 
<br/>progressive journey towards fulfilling the ideals of parliamentary democracy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, to conclude, it is with great eagerness and energy that I look forward 
<br/>to  serving  in  this  role  as  Speaker,  especially  to  work  with  you  to  ensure  that  our  Parliament  is 
<br/>effective and relevant to the needs of our people.  May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji.
