<h3>DEBATE ON THE REVISED 2021-2022 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>DEBATE ON THE REVISED 2021-2022 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament passed on 
<br/>Thursday, 24th March, 2022, we will now proceed with the resumption of debate on the Revised 
<br/>2021-2022 Budget.  Honourable Members, take note that each Member may speak only once to the 
<br/>Revised Appropriation Bill as well as all the Consequential Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call upon the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>give his response to the Revised 2021-2022 Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also rise to offer our response from 
<br/>this  side  of  Parliament  to  the  proposed  Revised  Budget  which  was  presented  last  night  by  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister of Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the outset, Sir, it would be remiss of me if I do not acknowledge the honourable Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of 
<br/>the Government Backbenches. I also acknowledge the presence of the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same token, I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of 
<br/>the honourable Members of the loyal Opposition in welcoming our honourable Prime Minister back 
<br/>into the country, particularly in this august Parliament after a very successful medical procedure in 
<br/>Melbourne, Australia. We would like to wish him the very best and we will continue to pray for his 
<br/>health.  We acknowledge and thank his  family and the people of Fiji  for their moral  support and 
<br/>prayers during those very difficult times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same token, we are also saddened to hear the shocking news of the 
<br/>untimely loss of your youngest brother, the late Ratu Keni Vuiyasawa, and, of course, your cousin, 
<br/>Ratu Visawaqa Cakobau. We would also like to share our deepest condolence to you, personally, Sir, 
<br/>your family and the </span><span>vanua vakaturaga o</span><span> Kubuna in the unexpected loss of two members of the </span><span>vanua 
<br/>vakaturaga</span><span>.  The two chiefs are very close relatives of mine as well, and our prayers are with you, 
<br/>your family and the </span><span>vanua</span><span> during this difficult time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me get back to the Budget Address and we all agree that we have just 
<br/>gone through a crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We feel that we are not out of the woods yet.  
<br/>Sir, there is an environment of uncertainty, fear, mistrust and lack of confidence amongst our different 
<br/>communities.  There are many reasons for the cause of uncertainty in our nation. One of the major 
<br/>reasons is the lack of confidence in the Government of the day due to manipulation, and the lack of 
<br/>transparency, particularly in matters of national interest in the last eight years or so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we were advised that there will be a Revised Budget, the first question 
<br/>that came to mind is that, do we really need to have a Revised Budget, taking into account that we 
<br/>are only three and half months away from the end of the current financial year?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expected a Revised Budget in late December or early January.  This is 
<br/>in line with the honourable Minister of Economy’s commitment when announcing the 2021-2022 
<br/>National Budget, when he clearly stated that a Revised Budget will be announced if the need arises.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>819 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in considering the Revised Budget, a number of factors have come to mind.  As at 20th 
<br/>February,  2020  we  have  received  more  than  $1.8  billion  of  assistance  from  abroad  and  this  is 
<br/>unprecedented.  This includes $838 million in grant, direct budget support and loans and aid-in-kind 
<br/>of about FJ$10.86 million.  This excludes the $200 million loan from Japan and the sale of 44 per 
<br/>cent  of  the  EFL  share.    In  addition,  Sir,  in  the  last  five  year’s  Government,  on  average,  usually 
<br/>underspent  around  $500  million.  The  Government  should  consider  funding  urgent  expenditure 
<br/>through reallocation from existing resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am  fully aware that  you cannot transfer funds directly  from one Head of  Expenditure to 
<br/>another, but there are already adequate funds in Head 50 to be utilised for urgent expenditure request 
<br/>from  Government  agencies,  if  it  cannot  be  sourced  from  within  the  ministry’s  budget  which  are 
<br/>normally underspent.  It is time that the Government should show some humanity, compassion and 
<br/>be more transparent to the people of Fiji so that we can all be united and move forward together as a 
<br/>united nation living in this extraordinary time rather than creating further uncertainty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in 2014, the Government fiscal strategy we could say was very well articulated and very 
<br/>sound  but  in  reality,  they  practise  the  opposite.    According  to  the  fiscal  framework  of  2014,  the 
<br/>Government will gradually consolidate Government finance over the medium term and will continue 
<br/></span><span>to  increase  its  operating  savings  by  strengthening  collection  of  operating  revenue  and  prudently 
<br/></span><span>managing operational expenditure.  Most importantly, a large share of Government expenditure will 
<br/>be directed towards investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2016-2017 Budget Strategy stated that the Government will stimulate the economy to 
<br/>generate growth to provide the fiscal space needed to consolidate Government finance.  Again, in the 
<br/>2018-2019 inancial year, the Strategy stated that the Government will reduce the net deficit gradually 
<br/>to 3 per cent and reduce it further to 2.5 per cent in 2019-2020.  I will be deliberating further in detail 
<br/>on the failure and inconsistency of the FijiFirst Fiscal Framework when highlighting the status of the 
<br/>nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, the truth of the matter is that, nothing has been achieved thus far but the nation’s 
<br/>socio-economic indicators continue to decline and we are currently in a very poor state.  The claim 
<br/>that we will be like Singapore and be better than Australia and New Zealand, I think, is rather a sick 
<br/>joke. We should not be comparing ourselves with Singapore and New Zealand most importantly, 
<br/>Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The focus of our development agenda must be based on the premise of availability of our 
<br/></span><span>natural  resources,  our  own  human  resources  capacity  and  at  the  same  time,  be  mindful  of  our 
<br/></span><span>vulnerability as  a Small  Island  Developing State  (SIDS).  Most importantly,  we must ensure that 
<br/>people are generally happy rather than be rich, unhappy and with unsustainable debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, when we turn to the future outlook, there is no doubt, we will all appreciate and agree 
<br/>that the whole world is now living in extraordinary times and Fiji is not excluded, as highlighted by 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Economy.  Although we have gone through three waves of COVID-19 
<br/>with  different  intensities,  we  still  have  to  live  with  the  pandemic  and  must  continue  to  make  the 
<br/>necessary adjustments to live with a new norm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, we are now facing an uncertain future because of the crisis in Europe, which could 
<br/>further escalate, particularly in the increase in the price of petroleum products and the major strain in 
<br/>the supply of chain of goods and services.  Those two events have brought a very clear message that 
<br/>we must make hard decisions to ensure that we brace and cushion the impact of those unprecedented 
<br/>events in the short, medium and in the long term.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is time that we take a united front as a nation. We must put aside our personal egos, 
<br/>small differences and collectively work together in our resolve for the interest of our people rather 
<br/>than self-centred interest or the interest of the selected few, which has become the norm under the 
<br/>Bainimarama-led Government.  I say this with all honesty and sincerity because I believe that we are 
<br/>all patriotic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I urge the Government not to politicise issues and consider our comments constructively 
<br/>and recommendations positively, and make adjustments when necessary rather than continue to be 
<br/>defensive as usual.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it has been the norm of the honourable Minister of Economy to call Members of this side 
<br/>of  the  House  “unpatriotic”.    When  we  constructively  criticise  and  suggest  alternatives  to  be 
<br/>considered, his latest buzzword when people disagree or suggest alternatives, they are accused of 
<br/>being un-Fijian.  May I suggest to the honourable Minister of Economy that he must be more sensitive 
<br/>in the choice of words in the public domain, particularly in our multiracial and multicultural society.  
<br/>I believe that we are all patriotic in our own ways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, for me personally as a traditional leader and as an indigenous Fijian, I continue to be 
<br/></span><span>patriotic based on values and traditional norms, which I will continue to embrace for the common 
<br/></span><span>good so as other people in other different communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be interesting for the honourable Minister of Economy to explain the meaning of the 
<br/>term “un-Fijian” because everyone embrace values that are close to their heart, based on their belief, 
<br/>faith and culture.  Generally, the word “un-Fijian” creates an environment of uncertainty, mistrust 
<br/>and disunity amongst our different communities, particularly at a time when we must all be working 
<br/>together as a nation of one people with one common goal for a progressive and prosperous society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  budget  announcement,  Sir,  generally,  the  people  of  Fiji  and  those  who  are  abroad 
<br/>always  take  a  keen  interest  and  look  forward  to  any  budget  announcement  based  on  their  own 
<br/>individual or group interest.  Basically, they will be asking the fundamental question on what is there 
<br/>for them in the budget.  As I say this, I would like to refer the Government of the day to the amount 
<br/>of revenue that has been generated by the people who live abroad and send money back to Fiji, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  basic  question  there  and  now  I  am  asking,  is  there  something  for  them  there  in  the 
<br/>Budget?  Because remittance has surpassed other major sectors of our economy and we do not need 
<br/>to emphasise that in this august House, Sir, it is clear as daylight.  But, again, when you have $600 
<br/></span><span>million coming annually from overseas, what has the Government done to, at least, address the plight 
<br/></span><span>of our poor people when they do return home or when they make visits home? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have already echoed this in this august House, it will be similar to the Philippines.  They are 
<br/>providing certain percentages of allowable kilogrammes in freight when they come back home.  This 
<br/>is to support them in the great work that they have been doing for their motherland in sending money 
<br/>back home.  The question that we would like to ask is, what has the Government of the day done 
<br/>towards the plight of our people who have been leaving abroad and sending money back home?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  private  sector  and  business  community  will  always  anticipate  that  there  will  be 
<br/>incentives  available  to  support  their  businesses  to  grow  and  give  them  confidence  for  additional 
<br/>investment.    Workers  will  be  looking  forward  for  relief  to  cushion  the  impact  in  the  substantial 
<br/>increase in  the cost  of living that we are currently  experiencing and the possibility of increase in 
<br/>minimum living wages.  On that note, Sir, we, on this side of the House, are quite happy that at least 
<br/>we have heard from the horse’s mouth that he finally agreed on $4 minimum wage per hour.  I only 
<br/>wish if he could re-visit what we had stated in this august House in 2018 where the mention of $4 an

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>821 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hour basic wages was proposed from this side of the House.  My fellow honourable colleagues will 
<br/>be dwelling on that, and will elaborate further on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Four years late.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  Members  of  the  general  public  will  be  hoping  for 
<br/>improved services, particularly in health, education and better infrastructure facilities, whilst those 
<br/>in  the maritime zones  will  be looking for better  and improved shipping  services so that they can 
<br/>replenish their supplies in a timely manner and the availability of regular, reliable and effective social 
<br/>services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the national budget is an integral part in the planning and development of 
<br/>our economy.  It is unfortunate that the FijiFirst Government has not taken this as a serious exercise.  
<br/>Sir, with this budget presentation, we now have a record breaking trend by the Government – in that 
<br/>in the last 24 months, we have had four such budgetary presentations and adjustments.  Four, Sir!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is obvious from this that the Government just does not have the ability to properly plan 
<br/></span><span>anything.    It  has  grossly  failed  in  its  efforts  to  effectively  lay  out  its  12  months  revenue  and 
<br/>expenditure proposal, and this ad hoc conduct of Government seriously worries us and we know this 
<br/>is  an  election  budget.    That  is  the  bottom  line  of  the  budget  that  was  presented  last  night.  Sorry 
<br/>Minister, it is an election budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Absolutely!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  At  the  time  of  the  2021-2022  National  Budget 
<br/>presentation, many of us could predict that there would be another budget within 12 months and here 
<br/>we  are,  Sir.    The  people  and  all  those  who  care  about  the  country’s  economic  future  note  this  is 
<br/>another  bad  planning  of  Government.    The  Government  needs  to  think  hard.    We  all  know  that 
<br/>national budget making process goes in tandem with the long-term economic planning of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- From my experience, in 2020-2021 during the time of 
<br/></span><span>the  pandemic,  it  was  clear  that  Fiji,  like  other  small  island  developing  countries  needed  a  new 
<br/>approach  to  policies  to  alter  the  structure  of  the  economy.    We  stated  this  very  clearly  in  our 
<br/>presentation at the last Budget session.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  should  have  considered  a  long-term  structural  adjustment  policy.  
<br/>Alternatively, that plan (2021-2022 Budget) and now this adjustment could have aimed to materialise 
<br/>and reflect the plan for future economic development and growth. Clearly, Sir, it is not.  This is all 
<br/>about election in 2022, Sir.  We know that the FijiFirst Government is  desperate to make a huge 
<br/>impression on the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- We have been doing that for seven years now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Desperate!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>822 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- People have seen the Government’s gross failure in 
<br/>everything  from  bad  policies  to  managing  the  COVID-19  crisis  related  to  mobility  restrictions, 
<br/>healthcare facilities and support services to economic policy blunders.  So far, Government’s policies 
<br/>have  not  shown  much  result  to  spin  the  economic  recovery.    An  efficacious  budgetary  process 
<br/>involves incorporating valuable suggestions from the line ministers, public officials, parliamentarians 
<br/>and most importantly, the citizens through public forums. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  budget  systematically  transforms  those  demands  and  proposals  into  allocations 
<br/>embedded with policies for implementation for the progress of society.  Moreover, a sound budgeting 
<br/>practice stimulates trust amongst citizens that the Government is taking into consideration concerns 
<br/>raised by them, and is dedicated to implementing the plans that are designed to achieve the greater 
<br/>needs of society.  Those goals and objectives must be prescribed by policies and be within the reach 
<br/>of  the  country’s  realisable  stock  of  resources.    It  then  becomes  the  obligation  of  the  State  to 
<br/>implement them with absolute proficiency, and render it sustainable within a timeframe but definitely 
<br/>for at least, in 12 months.  Many studies have shown that well-structured long-term policies are very 
<br/>effective  in  creating  growth.    Policies  must  clearly  send  out  positive  signal.    Our  policies  do  not 
<br/>bounce out any such signal.  As a key stakeholder in the economy, the Government should exercise 
<br/>clarity, that is, objectivity, transparency, credibility and reliability to provide direction to all other 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders.  Those have been distinctly missing in the last four budget presentations since March  
<br/></span><span>2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Budget is not a mere document, but rather a contract between the citizens and 
<br/>the State, depicting the plan for nurturing and allocating public resources for rendering services to 
<br/>the people.  The Government has grossly failed in this regard.  Waste and misuse of public resources 
<br/>has been the hallmark of the FijiFirst Government since long and as a result, we have only seen the 
<br/>sufferings of our people in the last 24 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hundreds of deaths during the height of the second wave of the pandemic occurred due to 
<br/>negligence and massive gaps in our health system. If our health system was any better, we could have 
<br/>avoided many of the deaths that happened.  Without international tourists and lacklustre industries, 
<br/>the Fijian economy is doomed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Sir,  I  am  quite  happy  to  note  that  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  has 
<br/>announced certain improvements in the way our health officers are to be treated.  They have slowly 
<br/>made a piecemeal arrangement in getting together the old policies of overtime payment for our nurses 
<br/>and they have the various descriptions of how the overtime is going to be paid because this has seen 
<br/></span><span>to the slow mass movement of nurses to better opportunities abroad and that has created the gap.  
<br/></span><span>Even though we have two outlets of training nurses through the College of Nursing and that of the 
<br/>one run by Sangam, yet we are still short of our nurses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  some  of  the  fundamental  questions  that  I  have  been  raising  in  anticipation  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announcement of this Revised Budget includes, will the Revised Budget: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>

<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stimulate or reinvigorate the economy in crisis;  
<br/>address the low level of investment;   
<br/></span><span>generate employment opportunities;  
<br/></span><span>reduce poverty and hardship;  
<br/>cushion and address our unsustainable debt;  
<br/>consider sustainable revenue options;  
<br/>improve productivity in the economy;  
<br/></span><span>address the increase in price of goods and services; and 
<br/></span><span>address the increase in the price of fuel?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some measures were announced last night and we are grateful for that, Sir.  At the sectoral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>level, whether the Revised Budget will – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide additional resources to support and improve our health services (infrastructure and 
<br/>supply of basic medicines) and manpower after mass resignation, particularly from nurses 
<br/>(I have just highlighted); 
<br/>improve our education system - Pre-School, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary;   
<br/>ensure food security and export-led growth;  
<br/>improve  production  in  resource-based  sector  (Agriculture,  Fisheries,  Forestry  and 
<br/>Manufacturing, et cetera) which are performing well below potential;  
<br/>improve basic infrastructure; and   
<br/>support our rural people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the current state of the economy, if I may turn to that now, our economy 
<br/>is in a precarious position with very few options available. The risks and uncertainties to the economy 
<br/>are quite  enormous.  While the risks such as  climatic calamities and pandemic-related uncertainty 
<br/>continue, new global shocks continue to pose risks. While these are largely beyond our control, the 
<br/>Government needs to be imaginative in providing new options.  The Government’s vulnerabilities 
<br/>have been magnified due to its own faults and lack of understanding of the issues. As the IMF puts 
<br/>it, Fiji remains at a very high risk. The recovery and medium-term outlook in the baseline scenario 
<br/>also  hinge  on  a  full  recovery  of  tourism,  but  it  is  unclear  whether  the  pre-pandemic  tourism  and 
<br/>spending patterns will re-establish favourable conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to pause for a moment and go back to some of the data that was provided in this 
<br/>august Parliament by the honourable Minister responsible for Tourism, that they have been getting 
<br/>very good bookings before the opening of our borders.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think there 
<br/>was 80 per cent booking but only last night, I heard the reality that it was just around 50 per cent. As 
<br/>we were informed, maybe most of the tourists bookings have been withdrawn and then rebooked but 
<br/>they have been taken as something that we could be relying upon. Yet when the borders open, we are 
<br/>grateful that some at least have come, but not that it was suggested in this august House. This is the 
<br/>reason  why  the  Government  needs  to  re-examine  contingent  liabilities  that  exist  as  well.  These 
<br/>entities need appropriate implementation policies to remain viable and economically competitive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are already nasty observations about the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) in the social 
<br/>media and there are allegations of biases and favouritism in disbursement of  Government backed 
<br/>loans.  Broadly  speaking,  as  the  IMF  puts  it,  the  sustainability  of  the  economic  outlook  will  rest 
<br/>critically  on  the  Government's  ability  to  embark  on  policy  reforms  necessary  for  macro-fiscal 
<br/>stabilization and to begin reducing public debt, while at the same time creating economic growth via 
<br/>business confidence and productive investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now turn to the status of the nation’s debt stock. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue regarding 
<br/>our national debt has been in the public domain for some time and there has been a lot of discussion 
<br/>on the unsustainability of our national debt level.  Before deliberating on our high unacceptable level 
<br/>of exposure due to  our current  stock of unsustainable debt,  I would like to  revisit  statements and 
<br/>claims made by the honourable Minister of Economy regarding our national debt.  First, he continued 
<br/></span><span>to preach that we must borrow smartly and, second, in his statement published in the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> on 11</span><span>th</span><span>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was during his face to face consultation on the proposed Revised 2021-2022 National Budget 
<br/>in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  so  sad  and  unprofessional  as  usual,  for  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Economy to continuously blame previous  governments when things do not go right. The FijiFirst 
<br/>Government has been in power for more than 15 years and continue with the blame game like little 
<br/>kids rather than taking the responsibility head on.  The people of this country know the truth and they 
<br/>cannot be misled or be deceived anymore.  The “fact of the matter”, if I may quote his usual lines, is 
<br/>that our total accumulated debt since Independence up to 2005 for a 35-year period was around $2.42 
<br/>billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, just within a span of 15 years, our debt level has ballooned four times to almost $9.6 
<br/>billion. This is, in addition, to our contingency liability for the same period which has increased from 
<br/>$1.2 billion to $1.7 billion.  This means that our total national debt exposure</span><span> </span><span>today is hovering around 
<br/>$11 billion, more than our current level of GDP in real price.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The claim that previous governments used to borrow money to pay for operating expenditure, 
<br/>I think, is a lie.  It is quite mischievous, deceiving and amount to misleading to the public at large.  
<br/></span><span>Most  importantly,  it  undermines  the  integrity  of  previous  leaders  who  were  being  patriotic  and 
<br/></span><span>prudent in managing our public finance.  I remember, as part of the previous governments on many 
<br/>occasions, we were always reminded that we must borrow and live within our means and only borrow 
<br/>for capital formation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The claim that the current Government only borrow for capital expenditure is an outright lie, 
<br/>Sir.  The state of affair in our nation truly reflects the opposite.  Sir, one just have to look at investment 
<br/>trends in the country since 2010.  The highest level of investment on record by this Government was 
<br/>in  2013  during  the  upgrading  of  the  Nabouwalu/Dreketi  Road  at  a  cost  of  $228  million  funded 
<br/>through  a  Chinese  Government  loan  which  was  completed  in  2015.  Due  to  this  project,  our 
<br/>investment  was  27  per  cent  of  GDP.    Since  then  the  investment  in  the  country  continued  on  a 
<br/>declining trend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019 prior to COVID-19, our investment level was only hovering around 17 per cent of 
<br/>GDP, far below the 25 per cent level required to ensure that there is always going to be a sustainable 
<br/>growth  if  we  hit  25  per  cent.    This  is  despite  the  substantial  increase  of  our  loan  portfolio  and 
<br/>Government claim that it continue capital expenditure allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is worth reiterating that previous governments always have a well-planned investment 
<br/></span><span>programme under its Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) targeting infrastructure  projects 
<br/>with both, high economic and financial return (not less than 25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively), 
<br/>which are prioritised and properly-sequenced to ensure continuity and generate investment in other 
<br/>sectors so as to generate employment opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The major reason that loan funds were directed to infrastructure development purposes was 
<br/>because Fiji was classified as a developing country and not as an under-developed country, and could 
<br/>only have access to ordinary capital resources from multilateral institutions.  Most importantly, Sir, 
<br/>to ensure our unemployment rate remains low, today our unemployment rate is hovering around 4.8 
<br/>per cent, compared to the average rate of unemployment of 4.2 per cent previously under previous 
<br/>Government regimes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate that the nation’s status has been downgraded which is quite embarrassing, 
<br/>not because of the impact of climate change but because our GDP has declined in real terms and, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>825 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which I had stated earlier, that we are back to the 2014 level.  It underscores the fact that while other 
<br/>similar SIDS continue to progress, Fiji continues to lag behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, our international credit rating has been downgraded to show a high risk associated 
<br/>with our current high debt.  Despite the reminder from reputable experts and multilateral agencies, 
<br/>this  Government  continues  with  its  unsustainable  spending  spree.  The  poor  management  of  our 
<br/>Government finance and the lack of accountability and transparency has led to the increase of our 
<br/>debt stock which is unprecedented, Sir. We cannot blame COVID-19 since our debt level was already 
<br/>on the high side before 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another reason for the sad state of our debt is the marginalization and removal of institution 
<br/>that provides independent advice to the Government and ensure that there is always a “check and 
<br/>balance” in place to ensure that processes and procedures are followed as required under the law. The 
<br/>removal  and  marginalization  of  key  institutions  has  undermined  transparency  and  accountability, 
<br/>which is a hallmark of the dictatorial approach of the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no such thing as borrowing smartly. At the end of the day, debt has 
<br/>to be paid, whether it is concessional loan or interest-free loan. Therefore, Sir, it is fair to say that 
<br/></span><span>this Government will leave a legacy of intergenerational debt, and not the previous governments as 
<br/></span><span>claimed by the honourable Minister of Economy. We can confidently say, Sir, that our accumulated 
<br/>debt is getting from bad to worse. The existing debt to GDP ratio is extremely high and currently 
<br/>hovering around 90 per cent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the prevailing conditions, any added government expenditure would 
<br/>squeeze the remaining fiscal space to near zero. This puts Fiji in the league of “Highly Indebted Poor 
<br/>Countries” (HIPC).  Sir, we expect the debt to GDP ratio to reach as high as 95 per cent by the end 
<br/>of  2021-2022  fiscal  year,  if  the  current  national  budget  20  expenditures  were  executed  fully  and 
<br/>contingent liabilities were taken into consideration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Government’s planned medium term strategy to 
<br/>reduce the debt ratio to 80 per cent by 2025-2026 and 60 per cent by 2035-2036 may be reasonable, 
<br/>but requires many fiscal abstinence during the first phase of this process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IMF in its December 2021 consultation statement has already stated 
<br/>about the severity of the debt situation Fiji is facing right now.  It states that Fiji's public debt situation 
<br/>worsened significantly in the wake of COVID-19 with a record economic contraction and sizeable 
<br/></span><span>fiscal deficits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it further stated that public debt increased to 70.8 per cent of GDP by the end of 2020 and 
<br/>it increased further by about 22 per cent points in 2021. As per the IMF report, the debt reached 86 
<br/>per cent of GDP by the end of 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that the IMF conditioned the reduction of Fiji’s public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debt over the medium term only if there were:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a steady recovery in economic growth;  
<br/>implementation of a phased fiscal consolidation plan; and 
<br/>no new major shocks occurred. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In the post-December 2021 eventualities, Sir, all the three conditions laid down by the IMF 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the fiscal consolidation to occur, seem nullified, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>826 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic recovery does not seem to be steady due to diminishing global demand due to 
<br/>war in Europe and US-China tensions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Government’s approach to fiscal consolidation does not seem to exist.  
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economy has already felt shocks, which could be long lasting.  This refers to the recent 
<br/>floods in Fiji, our Pacific neighbourhood and rising fuel prices globally, which are ominous 
<br/>signs of continued effect of the climate change and global conflict.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, the solution to our economic problem boils down to local action. Effectively, Fiji 
<br/>will need local resources to address the economy, which the Government barely has at its disposal, 
<br/>pertaining to stiff fiscal space.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impending consequences of additional Government outlays in the near 
<br/>future would raise the debt levels even further. With the debt level reaching 90 per cent of GDP, 
<br/>relying on domestic resources is not possible.  It is certain that the Government’s hoodwinking tactics 
<br/>will not work anymore, Sir.  Real problems need genuine solutions.  Blaming the past governments 
<br/>will surely not  work. We need  creative solutions  proposed and delivered  by those who know the 
<br/>issues and solutions that are effective, innovative and efficient.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now let me look at the review of our GDP growth.  Finally, the chicken has 
<br/></span><span>come  home  to  roost,  despite  the  claims  of  unprecedented  growth  in  the  last  15  years  under  the 
<br/>Bainimarama-led Government, the Government cannot hide any more from the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Sir, our real GDP growth is the same level as we had in 2014.  Therefore, very little 
<br/>or no progress has been made in the last eight years.  I would like to reiterate the point I had made 
<br/>earlier that we will never be the same as Singapore or better than Australia and New Zealand, as 
<br/>usually championed by the honourable Minister of Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact of the matter is that our real average growth for 10 years between 2011 and 2019 is 
<br/>only around 3.24 per cent, much lower than the growth period between 1971 and 1980 which was 
<br/>around 4.85 per cent. If we look that the real growth average between 2011 and 2020, it is only 0.75 
<br/>per cent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The low level of growth in the last 15 years or so is clearly reflected in our key macro and 
<br/>sectoral indicators, which clearly shows a declining trend. Whilst my esteemed colleagues on this 
<br/>side of Parliament will be deliberating on the details of the performance in their respective shadow 
<br/>portfolios,  I  will  just  provide  a  broad  overview,  Sir.    It  is  unfortunate  that  our  investment  as  a 
<br/></span><span>percentage  of  GDP  continues  to  decline,  despite  the  fact  that  Government  continues  to  take  an 
<br/></span><span>expansionary  approach.  There  is  nothing  to  show  for  the  unsustainable  debt  level  which  I  have 
<br/>highlighted earlier.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our investment, at the end of 2019 was just 17 per cent of GDP, far below the necessary level 
<br/>to  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth.  Unless  we  change  the  strategy  or  direct  our  resources  to 
<br/>meaningful investment, our economy will continue to be driven by consumption support by handout 
<br/>and freebies since we are in the election year and we will continue on a declining trend.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank you, honourable Ministers for your generosity in going around the country with 
<br/>boats and vehicles.  It is for the good of the country and at the same time, you are preparing for the 
<br/>elections as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Sir, we clearly notice that Ministers are going out….

<div><span>827 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  If  I  may  repeat  what  I  have  just  stated  earlier  on, 
<br/>especially the provision of  tractors, agricultural tools, fiberglass boats by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Labour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Direct assistance to the poor people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- I am thanking you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our current employment rate is hovering around 8.4 per cent which is unprecedented in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>history of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALVU.- Look at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government should review figures readily available rather than manipulating the facts to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suit their own narrow agendas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, associated with the low level of investment and high unemployment rate, 
<br/>we are experiencing today the increasing incidence of poverty.  Again, this is quite alarming when 
<br/>the urban population  has increased,  including that  of the peri-urban,  and  the rural  population  has 
<br/>decreased, yet poverty is on the increase again.  Today, we can confidently say that, at least, more 
<br/>than 40 per cent of our population are living below the poverty line and an additional 20 per cent are 
<br/>facing hardships. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These figures are based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) Report 
<br/>which was carried out by the BOS before the COVID-19 pandemic struck our shores.  At the end of 
<br/>2019, 30 per cent of our total population were living below the poverty line and majority of them 
<br/>reside in our rural areas and the maritime zone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was unfortunate that the messenger was sacked because the Government did not like the 
<br/></span><span>message.    Rather  than  sacking  the  messenger,  Government  should  look  at  sustainable  ways  of 
<br/>reducing poverty rather than the band-aid solution of giving out non-targetted assistance to those who 
<br/>do not really need them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On a positive note, it is interesting to note the high level in our foreign reserve which sits at 
<br/>around $3.2 billion which is equivalent to more than eight months of import of goods and services.  
<br/>Our liquidity level is hovering around $2.9 billion and remittance continues to increase and is now a 
<br/>major source of foreign exchange.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also interesting to see that our foreign reserve has increased during a period when our 
<br/>nation is in crisis and production is low.  That, again, is very interesting.  The foreign reserve has 
<br/>increased, yet our production is low.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Sir,  as  a  layman,  I  always  believe  that  foreign  reserves  are  mostly  earned  through 
<br/>income from export of goods and services.  But in our case, foreign reserve is generated through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>828 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grants, especially budget support and loans.  The question is, what happens when we start repaying 
<br/>those loans and they are not used for investment to generate income?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to direct budget support, this is the first time in the history of this beloved country 
<br/>of ours that we have received such assistance.  It is not the ability of this Government to negotiate 
<br/>such support as claimed.  Budget support are given on humanitarian grounds, honourable Minister, 
<br/>and decided by the donor to help the hardship that the people of Fiji are facing due to the pandemic. 
<br/>The Government, as usual, should stop boasting and misleading the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  sooner  or  later,  the  direct  budget  support  will  run  out  and  we  have  to  consider  other 
<br/>sources.  Therefore, the Government should ensure that funds are used in the most productive manner 
<br/>rather than the handout of freebies in anticipation of buying votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  interesting  to  note  the  high  liquidity  level  in  the  domestic  market  which  is  hovering 
<br/>around  $2.9  billion.  High  liquidity  may  be  good  in  the  short  term  but  it  continues  to  increase 
<br/>substantially  after  2017  prior  to  the  pandemic.    To  me,  Sir,  this  means  that  the  people  are  not 
<br/>borrowing and financial  institutions are reluctant  to  lend because of the high risk associated with 
<br/>lending, and the borrower being reluctant to borrow because of the lack of confidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a clear indication of the general lack of confidence in the economy, particularly foreign 
<br/>investors, due to  poor  governance, poor  policies, poor law  and order situations and human rights 
<br/>abuse that are critical to ensure confidence.  The risk is just too high for all parties, Sir.  As I have 
<br/>said  earlier,  remittance  continues  to  increase,  particularly  personal  transfers  which  has  surpassed 
<br/>revenue generated by tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On many occasions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have highlighted the importance of remittances for 
<br/>our economy in this august Parliament.  I have also stated this and alluded to it just a while ago, and 
<br/>suggest that Government to consider ways of incentivising our people who are living abroad to send 
<br/>more personal remittance.  The Government should, at least, support them in reducing the cost of 
<br/>transferring funds to Fiji and at the same time, look at ways to ensure that remittances received are 
<br/>invested in productive sectors with high returns. I believe with the support from Government, our 
<br/>people from abroad will send more money into the country.  We are grateful for what we heard last 
<br/>night, yes, rugby investment opportunities that have been created.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  sectoral  performance,  the  poor  performance  of  our  natural  resource-based  sector, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including tourism, just confirms the low growth rate experienced in the last five years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contribution of our agricultural sector continues to decline, despite the 
<br/>fact that it is very important for our food security and export.  We all understand the hard work that 
<br/>the Government and the honourable Minister for Agriculture is undertaking, going around supplying 
<br/>seeds, et cetera, but what is the likely turnaround time?  Another 10 years, 15 years?  The agriculture 
<br/>sector used to be right at the forefront since Independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016, agriculture including the sugar sector contributed almost 20 per cent of our GDP.  In 
<br/>2020,  it  contributed  3  per  cent  and  in  2021  down  to  1.1  per  cent.    Government  should  seriously 
<br/>consider allocating more resources to the agricultural sector in providing employment opportunities 
<br/>and increase production for domestic consumption and export, rather than encouraging the import of 
<br/>food products which will continue to drain our foreign reserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we just need to take a look at the government of Israel.  We spent quite a lot of time in 
<br/>the government of Israel together with the honourable Ministers on the other side who served in the 
<br/>military.  They only became independent in 1948, yet they are self-sufficient in food and there is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>829 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>surplus, now they are exporting.  Their total land area is only 22,000 square kilometres, ours when 
<br/>we put all our 300 islands together, it comes to about 18,000 square kilometres.  The difference is 
<br/>not that much, yet they do intensive grazing. They are self-sufficient in dairy products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the first Gulf War they supplied dairy products to the allied forces that were based in 
<br/>Arabia.  This is just to show how a country like Israel can turn things around and be self-sufficient 
<br/>in a very short time and more importantly, they then have a very healthy population because of the 
<br/>surplus of food and the availability of food, which reduces the recurring cost of maintaining hospitals.  
<br/>They only have about two major hospitals - one in Haifa and another one in Jerusalem.  The rest are 
<br/>just health clinics.  Was that not part of our plan soon after Independence - health centres?  However, 
<br/>those health centres are very much neglected now.    Maybe we will see the interlinks between the 
<br/>agricultural sector and other sectors of the economy coming together or contributing to each other 
<br/>and that affects the healthy growth of the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  should  consider  alternative  and  diversification  within  the  sugar  industry.  The  SDL 
<br/>Government  came  up  with  the  idea  of  alternative  livelihood.    It  is  good  to  hear  what  has  been 
<br/>proposed by the honourable Minister of Economy last night in trying to help the sugar industry, or 
<br/>the low production farmers relying heavily on their leaseholds to provide them with shelter.  But I 
<br/></span><span>hope they should vigorously work on that to ensure that there is better feedback from the returns from 
<br/></span><span>the agriculture sector, or the overall economic sector at large. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  we  are  now  looking  at  mechanization  through  co-operative  arrangements  to  assist 
<br/>smallholder farmers.  Our forestry sector, despite the increase in the harvest of mahogany and pine 
<br/>plantations,  its  contribution  to  our  economy  continues  to  decline.    In  2014,  the  forestry  sector 
<br/>contributed to around 36.7 per cent to our GDP and in 2020, its contribution was only around 3.2 per 
<br/>cent.  Rather than exporting wood chips and sawn timber, we should consider more value addition to 
<br/>support employment, foreign exchange earnings and improve the income of resource owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I turn to fisheries and aquaculture sector which is also important for our food security and its 
<br/>contribution to GDP, I am sorry honourable Minister, it is still marginally low.  The industrial fishing 
<br/>sector  continues  on  a  declining  trend  and  we  need  to  look  at  innovative  ways  to  entice  foreign 
<br/>industry players to return to our shores.  There must be incentives, the right mix of policies to support 
<br/>the industry by making Fiji a viable port for them to offload their catch and at a competitive cost for 
<br/>the provision of auxiliary services such as bunker, ship repairs and the replenishment of supplies of 
<br/>quality and most importantly, it should be at a reasonable cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there is very little improvement in our manufacturing sector.  Its contribution to GDP has 
<br/></span><span>declined from 16.5 per cent in 2014 to 2.3 per cent in 2018 and only 0.3 per cent in 2021.  Again, it 
<br/>is  a  clear  indication  to  the  lack  of  confidence  from  our  manufactures  to  extend  their  productive 
<br/>capacity due to the lack of confidence in the government of the day.  The sad reality is that, only a 
<br/>few selected companies have been given preference and priority.  There must be a consistency of 
<br/>policy so that we have the confidence to compete on a level playing field.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another major contributor to our foreign exchange is through transshipment.  In 2014, we 
<br/>earned  $1.1  billion  and  in  2019,  we  only  earned  $990.4  million.    The  decline  in  re-export  is  a 
<br/>challenge  because  our  services  are  getting  quite  expensive.    Therefore,  other  island  nations  are 
<br/>considering other options and alternatives which are cheaper and reliable.  It is unfortunate that we 
<br/>have not improved our port facilities in order to be more cost effective and become more competitive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  taking  into  account  the  background  information  that  I  have  earlier 
<br/>elaborated on, I will now turn to the revised budget proper.  As usual, the revised budget continues 
<br/>to be bullish and sugar-coated to say the least.  We all know it is full of promises and  will not be

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fulfilled and programmes that will not be implemented.  The marketing gimmick by the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy to attract voters as we move towards the election will not work because the 
<br/>people of Fiji know the truth since they have been misleading the nation in the last 15 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, it is anticipated that revenue is to increase from $2.085 billion to $2.253 billion, an 
<br/>increase of over $200 million while expenditure is expected to increase by over $100 million from 
<br/>$3.691 billion to $3.715 billion.  As I had stated earlier, these figures are unrealistic because of the 
<br/>following - on average, the annual revenue shortfall is around $500 million in the last five years and 
<br/>average annual under-expenditure is always around $600 million.  Therefore, how realistic are these 
<br/>revenue and expenditure figures, taking into account the shortfall in revenue and under-expenditure?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the revenue side, it is interesting to note that the VAT for, at least, 21 basic food items 
<br/>will be zero-rated and there will be an increase of VAT of 15 per cent to the 21 items.  The bottom 
<br/>line here is that, the poor will not only benefit from the zero-rated VAT items but also the rich.   They 
<br/>also eat flour, they also eat everything that you are now promoting that would attract the poor people 
<br/>but you are excluding the rich because they also eat that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  also  means  that  the  poor  will  have  difficulty  in  accessing  items,  such  as  textiles  and 
<br/></span><span>footwear. The basic principal of VAT is that, it is broad based and everyone share the burden with a 
<br/></span><span>small increase, everyone pays equal tax.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To help the poor and most vulnerable, a more targeted approach is more feasible to increase 
<br/>existing assistance due to the increase in VAT, rather than directly removing VAT on basic food 
<br/>items  which  will  also  benefit  the  rich.    That  is  my  solution,  honourable  Minister  for  Education, 
<br/>Heritage and Arts and Community Development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It will never work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- It will.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the increase in the minimum wage to $4 per hour, although it will be in four tranches, its 
<br/>impact  on  our  suffering  and  narrow-based  manufacturing  sector  will  be  unsustainable  for  small 
<br/>manufacturing businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is  common knowledge that our manufacturing sector  performance  is  on the decline 
<br/>since 2014.  In 2014, the manufacturing sector contributed 16.5 per cent to our GDP.  In 2018, it was 
<br/></span><span>only 2.3 per cent and in 2021, it further reduced to 0.3 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate that very little attention is given to this sector. Whilst we recognize that it is 
<br/>important that we should expand our health services through Private General Practitioners, it is also 
<br/>important to upgrade the existing public health facilities which are in very much dilapidated state. 
<br/>The WHO Report status of health service in the country indicated that very little has been done to 
<br/>improve existing facilities since 2016.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, on this side of the House, welcome the increase in the allocation for our public utilities 
<br/>but the question is, whether these institutions will have access to additional funds when required or 
<br/>they  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  fully  implement  projects  and  have  been  earmarked  for 
<br/>implementation. The following entities in the last five years on average have underspent or did not 
<br/>utilize funds allocated to them - Water Authority - $110 million;  Fiji Roads Authority - $227 million;  
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture - $32.9 million;  Ministry of Fisheries - $9.53 million; Commerce and Trade 
<br/>- $19.83 million; Sugar - $17.55 million; Local Government - $13.18 million and  Miscellaneous 
<br/>Services - $239.97 million.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>831 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is that, most of the ministries underutilized the 
<br/>fund  allocated  to  them.    In  total,  government  average  under  expenditure  is  around  $500  million 
<br/>annually.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is very clear in our mind  is that, the Revised Budget 
<br/>presented by the honourable Minister of Economy last night is sugar-coated to deceive the people of 
<br/>Fiji, and which in simple term, is just an election gimmick to buy votes, give false  promises and 
<br/>hoodwink the people of this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say with confidence, Sir, because the inconsistency in messages delivered by the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy and the reality on the ground differs. The budget figures, at least, in the last 
<br/>five years shows a lot of inconsistency in commitment outlined in fiscal framework in paper which 
<br/>is totally inconsistent or opposite from the action taken on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  debt  level  will  increase  and  is  unsustainable.    Our  revenue  measures,  sound  good  on 
<br/>paper but the reality there is always  a shortfall  year  in  and  year out. This Budget  adjustment is a 
<br/>desperate measure to  remain in  power by the FijiFirst  Government.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  not  an 
<br/>adjustment, this is entirely a new budget altogether.  It is not a supplementary budget. This raises 
<br/></span><span>many questions about the authenticity and sincerity in our budget making conventions.  It seems like 
<br/></span><span>this budget is a full national budget for the next 12 months and, again, it comes with a statement of 
<br/>review.    This  does  not  seem  like  an  adjustment.  Indeed,  this  is  not  genuine.  This  is  another 
<br/>hoodwinking exercise, in fact, it is a crude joke on our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are the fundamental reasons why the Government is not opening up for debate on this 
<br/>Appropriation Bill. Putting down Standing Order 101 is a mockery of Parliament and the Opposition 
<br/>condemns  it  in  the  strongest  terms  possible.  Not  given  time  to  the  Opposition  to  respond 
<br/>appropriately to an Appropriation Bill, is contrary to democratic norm.  While measures taken in this 
<br/>adjustment to reduce food and fuel prices is welcomed, the question is, why now? This reduction in 
<br/>VAT on basic food items should have been done in 2021 and the Budget was considered in July 
<br/>2021.  However, the VAT increase from 9per cent to 15 per cent on non-essential goods and services 
<br/>is an aggressive policy move.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  on  one  hand,  food  and  fuel  prices  are  reduced,  all  other  prices  including  investment 
<br/>commodity will increase.  It is obvious that the Government is financing this budget using grants from 
<br/>our donors and developing partners. This is the reason why the Government is suppressing the necessary 
<br/>debate on the Bill. Is this the reason for the honourable Minister of Economy not to show clearly the 
<br/></span><span>revenue streams in the Budget? If the Budget is, indeed, an adjustment, all actual revenues in the last 
<br/></span><span>period need a clear disclosure. Why are those disclosures not being made?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  measures  taken  under  this  adjustment  has  no  clear  indication  for  a  long  term  policy 
<br/>adjustment towards economic growth and development. On the contrary, increasing VAT from 9 per cent 
<br/>to 15 per cent on non-essential goods and services will only increase the production cost. The honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy intends to fix healthcare services overnight by tweaking a few policies. The people 
<br/>have  suffered  terrible  healthcare  services  for  quite  some  time,  while  the  rich,  including  the  fellow 
<br/>Government  Ministers  have  the  luxury  of  overseas  treatment.  Some  of  the  measures,  such  as 
<br/>pharmaceutical policies may be helpful but the shortage of doctors and nurses in the country will not 
<br/>realize the shortages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of the Ministers assertions about better health services due to change in policies are pipe 
<br/>dreams and utterly wishful. We cannot produce doctors and nurses in a short period.  It takes years to 
<br/>train them.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Only last year the Minister declared policies to withdraw MBBS scholarships and now it brings back 20 
<br/>scholarships provided with Government grant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Only last year the Minister effected policies to increase the qualifying marks of TELS to 280 and 
<br/>now reduces it to 250.  This is the very same thing that happened when the SVT Government came in, 
<br/>when we introduced the Fijian Affairs Scholarship and the Multi-Ethic Affairs Scholarship because most 
<br/>of our indigenous Fijians and rural Indians of Indian descent are late starters. That is something that we 
<br/>have to accept as part of us in this small world. When you are a late starter, why can you not be accessible 
<br/>to scholarships with low entry marks?  Compare that to other Pacific regional countries that are part of 
<br/>the University of Fiji with low entry marks and us, we have to be moving it right up to 280.  For sure we 
<br/>are  just  creaming  off,  and  the  poor  will  suffer  here  more.    Otherwise,  you  go  through  the  TELS 
<br/>arrangement, when you are qualified or graduate, you are confronted with a high debt level.  That is a 
<br/>cause of problems in affluent countries, like the United States of America, right now, Sir.  High level of 
<br/>people committing suicide because they cannot pay the high debt level that they have to encounter.   
<br/>The Budget seems attractive and populist in a number of ways, such as price reduction by duty and VAT 
<br/>reduction but some economic growth you expect from tourism and infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, before I take my seat, I hope it will be not in the too distant future when we would be 
<br/></span><span>seeing  another  mini-budget  being  proposed  in  this  House,  just  to  help  us  guide  through  the 
<br/></span><span>Government  in  its  preparation  for  the  elections.    In  view  of  those  inconsistencies  and  lack  of 
<br/>transparency and accountability in the management of our public finance, we are not in a position to 
<br/>support the Revised Budget.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.32 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today in support of the Revised Budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>submitted to Parliament by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister of Economy last night. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to congratulate the honourable Minister of Economy for an 
<br/>announcement that so clearly made the global context local for every Fijian.  It was an eye-opener 
<br/>and  a  lesson  in  economic  statecraft  for  the  people  who  heard  it  and  I  suspect  that  even  a  few 
<br/>disappointed honourable Members from the other side of the aisle had to concede grudgingly and 
<br/>silently, of course, so no one would hear them that we were right. Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, seeing where 
<br/>Fiji is today, I am going to give myself the right to tell the Opposition and every detractor where we 
<br/>were right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were right to loosen the public purse, of course. Virtually every country in the world did 
<br/>it because it is a proven way to prevent an economic collapse and the social chaos that would follow. 
<br/>We were right to seek cheap and highly concessional loans abroad, and we were right to lower taxes 
<br/>and keep money in the pockets of the people and businesses of Fiji.  We were right to support families 
<br/>in the formal and informal sector with unemployment assistance. That was a small price to pay to 
<br/></span><span>keep households afloat economically and keep our society cohesive and strong.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  were  right  to  mandate  vaccines.  We  were  right  to  re-open  the  border  and  start  our 
<br/>recovery. We were right to return our children to school and time will prove the announcements made 
<br/>yesterday to be the right decisions as well. Just as we adapted during COVID, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>have adapted to the food shortage and supply chain crisis as a result of the pandemic and Russia’s 
<br/>senseless war on the Ukrainian people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  21  essential  household  items  will  be  zero  rated  VAT  from  1st  April,  a 
<br/>measure that reaches far beyond what was called the six basic food items that were once VAT exempt. 
<br/>These six items were frankly more of a political ploy than anything else but that was then and this is 
<br/>now  and  the  measure  that  was  announced  last  night  makes  living  more  affordable  for  ordinary 
<br/>households because we know that the listed food and non-food items are essential in all homes. It is 
<br/>practical and wide enough to give actual relief.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that honourable Members of the Opposition no matter what, will rise to oppose, as 
<br/>they have a track record of doing so.  Ridiculous as their objections would be, but this time around I 
<br/>do not think their hearts would really be in it because the truth may be inconvenient or politically not 
<br/></span><span>in their favour at times, but it is still the truth. The proof, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is in our bustling streets, 
<br/></span><span>our busy shops and the planes of Fiji Airways which are bringing people back to Fiji; Fijians abroad 
<br/>who have missed their native home and their families, people in  transit  and tourists.  Tourists are 
<br/>coming back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether  you believe our policies were right or not, we should all 
<br/>rejoice in that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our economy is rebounding under difficult global circumstances, of course, as the honourable 
<br/>Attorney- General explained, but we are meeting this challenge as well. We have suspended the fuel 
<br/>tax, adjusted the VAT and lowered or eliminated duties on many items, all to help our citizens absorb 
<br/>the impact of higher global prices. These high prices will not last forever and we will adjust again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the many initiatives announced under the umbrella of the adjusted budget 
<br/>are truly  remarkable, remarkable because a majority of them cost  little or nothing but  promise to 
<br/>produce great dividends, some right away and of course some over time. Rational reform has been a 
<br/>defining feature of my government, and we are redoubling our efforts to change laws, regulations 
<br/>and practices that stifle initiative and limit the choices available to Fijians.  The medical reforms will 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>free the resources of our public system while giving Fijians more choice and access to more services, 
<br/>expanding access to private practitioners and dentists and we will break up the shameless system that 
<br/>has kept good doctors out of private practice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am extremely proud of the reforms announced last night that will make 
<br/>the iTLTB a more efficient organisation in the service of our landowners, tenants and the growth of 
<br/>the wider economy. As guaranteed for all time under our Constitution, iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>land is protected and 
<br/>will remain with our landowners forever. Developing this resource for their benefit is vital to our 
<br/>recovery because when our landowners receive the right returns and tenants have security of tenure, 
<br/>the rest of us Fijians succeed with them and that is the mission we have instilled in the iTLTB as part 
<br/>of this reform programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, every time we do something to help our iTaukei communities preserve and use 
<br/>their land, most of the Opposition figures inside  and outside Parliament try to stoke fear amongst 
<br/>them that their land is threatened. Yet, the only threat they face is from the status quo and the politics 
<br/>of fearmongering, which keeps them from using their most valuable asset to become wealthier. And 
<br/>despite all the fear that the Opposition seeks to brew among our landowners, we are forging ahead 
<br/>with reforms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a daily basis more and more iTaukei landowners are coming forward to partner with us in 
<br/>these reforms because they are realizing that the politics of fear, fear without any rhyme or reason 
<br/>will not get them anywhere. The only group that will get somewhere will be those politicians who 
<br/>simply want to gain political office by misleading their own people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, under my chairmanship, iTLTB will modernise its practices.  It will improve 
<br/>customer service, both for the landowners and tenants.  It will outsource to engage professionals to 
<br/>carry out their subdivisions, as opposed to doing it in-house without the necessary professionalism 
<br/>and accountability. It will work intimately with and develop synergies with the Department of Town 
<br/>and  Country  Planning,  Ministry  of  Lands,  Ministry  of  Economy,  municipalities,  professional 
<br/>surveyors  and  valuers.  This  will  mean,  Mr.  Speaker,  subdivisions  and  zoning  being  carried  out 
<br/>professionally. No more disputes regarding boundaries and valuations. Therefore, unlocking earnings 
<br/>for landowners and, of course, creating greater opportunities for all Fijians that will rapidly grow our 
<br/>economy. No more working in isolation but working together for the benefit of all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Failed iTLTB subdivisions will be regularized again through this Budget. This will fix the 
<br/>longstanding problem of landlocked lots by funding the development of access roads to all tenants 
<br/></span><span>which  has  been  a  problem  so  far.  Imagine,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  you  leased  a  plot  of  land  that  was 
<br/></span><span>completely blocked in by other parcels and you had no access to a road.  That is what some tenants 
<br/>have been facing. The unlocking will, again, result in more earnings for landowners as they will get 
<br/>fully paid  premiums  and start  earning market  rates, and the tenants  on the other hand will obtain 
<br/>proper and secure leases, again, growing the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Soon partner entities will be connected to the iTLTB Land Development Vetting Committee 
<br/>(LDVC)  portal,  which  will  make  cooperation  easier  and  allow  all  to  track  surveys  to  ensure  that 
<br/>bottlenecks  are  identified  and  timelines  are  reduced.    All  of  these,  Mr.  Speaker,  means  that 
<br/>development can happen faster, sending subdivision of professionally well-planned schemed lots into 
<br/>overdrive, alongside our recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  all  of  these  reforms  at  iTLTB  are  separate  to  the  iTaukei  Land 
<br/>Development being carried out through the Ministry of Economy.  The subdivision initiative was 
<br/>devised by my Government because we understand that we need to help our landowners solve a very 
<br/>simple problem.  It is this - many of our landowners have huge assets at their disposal. They have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>835 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>large amounts of land but they do not always have enough cash at their disposal to develop that land 
<br/>for their benefit.  Rather than leave these communities vulnerable to third-party developers who will 
<br/>get  the  windfall,  Government  has  stepped  in.  We  want  to  ensure  that  landowners  receive  the 
<br/>maximum benefit of developing and leasing their land at fair market rates. That is our commitment 
<br/>and that drives our policies. Again, unlocking the economic potential for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Budget was also unflinching in addressing the massive increase in the cost 
<br/>of the inputs needed to grow cane, despite almost no rise in the world price of sugar.  Fertilizer is 
<br/>breaking price records - a spike that could break our cane farmers’ backs.  We are paying millions to 
<br/>shield them from global events that did nothing to cost but which could destroy the bottom line.  Still, 
<br/>many farmers are starting to recognise that their future is not in cane growing bit is in other more 
<br/>lucrative,  more  stable  and  promising  crops.    This  is  especially  true  among  the  majority  of  cane 
<br/>growers, the 43 per cent of cane growers who harvest less than 100 tonnes annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of those farmers were trapped in cane growing, held hostage to leases that did not allow 
<br/>them to do what every farmer in the world does - follow the market and grow the crops that make 
<br/>economic sense.  Some rightly feared they would be homeless if they ever dared to plant different 
<br/>crops, because they would be evicted as the lease does not allow that flexibility.  I know this, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, because when my team speaks with sugarcane farmers, we do not seek to exploit them for 
<br/></span><span>political purposes or see them as a voter bank.  I see them as Fijians who need genuine assistance to 
<br/>give  them  long  term  security  and  sustained  livelihoods,  so  they  can  live  and  work  in  peace  and 
<br/>security and with dignity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  stepping  in  to  help  convert  the  leases  of  any  cane  grower  who  seeks  another 
<br/>agricultural  purpose,  or  even  simply  for  residential  purposes.    We  will  do  so  by  conversing  with 
<br/>landowners,  seeking  their  consent,  working  with  TLTB,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  of  course  and 
<br/>providing a package to make this transition. So whether they choose to grow another crop, or simply 
<br/>reside on the land that they lease, they have the government’s support.  You cannot make a firmer 
<br/>commitment than that, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as the President of the Fiji Rugby Union of course, I would not be more excited 
<br/>about Government becoming the majority shareholder in the Fijiana and </span><span>Fijian Drua</span><span>. These teams 
<br/>are the future of Super Rugby, and we all see that weekend after weekend.  For years, our athletes 
<br/>have competed in the league on teams based overseas. Now, our rugby players are, I believe, the best 
<br/>players  in  the  world  and  have  the  chance  to  compete  for  Fiji.    Investing  in  them  is  the  smartest 
<br/>investment we can make. It is an investment in the Fijian brand that we could not match if we spent 
<br/></span><span>100 times our investment on advertising. And I hope very much to have this Budget passed in time 
<br/></span><span>to watch them take on the Rebels tonight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many of the members opposite, as well as those who have turned tail on 
<br/>their voters and abandoned their posts, have opposed every measure that carried us to this point.  Our 
<br/>recovery undermines their political narrative, and they know it.  This is why their analysis, if one can 
<br/>call it that, will become more wild, nonsensical and silly and of course, as seen last night, out of 
<br/>touch with ordinary Fijians. Their policy prescription for response to the economic crisis driven by 
<br/>the pandemic was simple. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They thought we should take to our bed and pull the covers over our heads until the crisis 
<br/>passed.  That is why they demanded we keep the border shut, they demanded we keep our children 
<br/>from returning to school, they went so far as to claim we should cut the salaries of the civil servants 
<br/>whose courage, commitment and compassion carried us through the pandemic.  They were wrong 
<br/>every time. We confronted the crisis. Now, they have a chance to show they care about the country 
<br/>and care about Fiji’s recovery by wholeheartedly supporting the Budget, without reservation.

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a saying that fortune favors the bold, Mr. Speaker.  Fiji, as I have said in the past, is 
<br/>a bold country, we are bold people.  Fijians deserve bold leadership and that is what we are giving 
<br/>them tirelessly.  So this is our challenge and our invitation to our colleagues across the aisle and those 
<br/>listening  in  the streets,  be bold  with  us, support this  Budget  and the measures that support every 
<br/>Fijian.  A wise man knows he cannot change the mistakes of the past.  What makes him wise is his 
<br/>determination not to repeat them.  Members of the Opposition, please, for once become wise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Opposition votes will speak louder than anything we have heard or that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can say in this session, will they be bold or will they go back to bed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  fellow  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, firstly, I would like to join my colleagues, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>those from  this  side in  taking this time to  welcome the honourable Prime Minister back into this 
<br/>august Parliament.  It is good to see that you are in good health, Sir.  I also take this time to remember 
<br/>those Members of Parliament who remain unwell during this time and let us keep them in our prayers 
<br/>and wish them a speedy recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I join my colleagues from the Opposition side of the House in making a 
<br/></span><span>snap contribution and oppose Bill No. 6 of 2022 which is for an Act to appropriate a sum of three 
<br/>billion, three hundred and two million, nine hundred and fifty six thousand, one hundred and eighty 
<br/>seven dollars ($3,302,956,187) for the ordinary services of Government for the year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 
<br/>2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, let me just say that this Supplementary Budget looks like a fully-fledged budget, instead 
<br/>of a revised budget.  After listening to the honourable Minister of Economy for more than two-and-
<br/>a-half hours last night, I would like to be excited about it, but then I realised that it is an election year 
<br/>so we should never be surprised when things seem too good to be true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier in this august Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when responding to an Appropriation Bill, 
<br/>I had stated that the devil is always in the detail.  Sir, we all understand that a budget is a plan that is 
<br/>to  be  implemented  but  whether  they  really  are  implemented  will  be  the  question,  and  I  begin  by 
<br/>looking at the zero-rated VAT products.  During this period of pandemic recovery any savings will 
<br/>be appreciated, however, 99 per cent of the time businesses do not pass their benefits to consumers.  
<br/>They find ways to retain existing costs and I note, for example, zero rating of flour, sugar, rice, to 
<br/>name a few, and this comes a day after the prices were increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  question  is,  how  will  Government  monitor  the  effective  implementation  of  these 
<br/>policies,  given  that  recently,  entities  have  increased  the  prices  of  their  products?    The  Fijian 
<br/>Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) is going to have an important task to ensure that 
<br/>zero-rated initiatives are truly passed on to consumers.  What seems to be the current norm now is 
<br/>that, price policy initiative announcements are made in this House but prices on foodstuff on shops 
<br/>and supermarket shelves still remain, so nothing has been passed on to consumers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I must say that a lot of things that the Opposition had raised is in this Revised 
<br/>Budget and for that, I must thank and commend the honourable Minister of Economy for listening, 
<br/>and listening is a biblical act, it is also a skill.  The </span><span>Bible</span><span> says, “When you listen to advice, you gain 
<br/>wisdom in the future.”  It will enable you to grow, gain knowledge, know the problems and resolve 
<br/>them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  2016,  SODELPA  and  I  had  been  advocating  in  this  House  for  an 
<br/>increase in the minimum wage to $4 per hour.  That is well established in our </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> and the 
<br/>gradual implementation this year is welcomed on behalf of our people.  To support such an increase, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>837 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>businesses  must  and  should  be  assisted  with  necessary  policies  and  environment  conducive  for 
<br/>economic  and  employment  generation  and  participation,  and  so  I  will  continue  to  be  the  devil’s 
<br/>advocate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we appreciate the generosity of the increase, there remain areas which Government 
<br/>needs to focus on to be able to assist businesses and employers meet this increased working capital.  
<br/>For instance, improve the ease of doing business and provide better import reliefs for raw materials 
<br/>and equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed that the honourable Minister has given assurance that the long 
<br/>awaited electronic shuttle will begin  its inception in  Fiji  around  the Valelevu area.  Way back in 
<br/>2015, I had raised in this august House that a US company had expressed interest to Government to 
<br/>assist with the monorail system for Fiji as a means of reducing our travel hours and giving us better 
<br/>travel experiences.  So seeing the implementation of such recommendation confirms to me that the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Economy is recognising the value and experience in contributions coming 
<br/>from this side of the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  now  look  forward  to  seeing  this  project  get  off  the  ground  and 
<br/></span><span>hopefully,  it  does  not  become  another  Waila  City  project  or  One  Hundred  Sands  Casino  project, 
<br/></span><span>whereby they look and sound beautiful on paper, but are absent in reality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things I have always said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that in leadership, you need political 
<br/>will and I note that Government is recognising the important role of civil servants and is re-instating 
<br/>a lot of entitlements, such as rural allowance and overtime due to respective cadre of employment.  I 
<br/>said entitlements because that is what it is, these are payments long overdue to them and in making 
<br/>the payments, Government is acknowledging that it had failed in its duty in the past to be a good and 
<br/>responsible employer when it had removed or suspended those entitlements in the recent past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate that the Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS) is not 
<br/>working or serving its stated objectives.  Nurses, for example, have resigned in massive numbers, as 
<br/>acknowledged  by  the  honourable  Minister  in  his  speech  yesterday  where  he  is  saying  that  the 
<br/>recruitment of new student nurses will now be 350 for 2022 from the current 100 students’ intake per 
<br/>annum.  Sir, it takes three long years for a student nurse to graduate, which means there will remain 
<br/>a gap in the health system provision, particularly from that provided by the nurses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2014, I stood in this House asking Government to consider the plight 
<br/></span><span>of nurses and their entitlements.  Again, these are well documented in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.  It is always 
<br/></span><span>advisable to listen and act when the time is right.  These few years are too late, but now that it is 
<br/>being implemented, we must ensure continued implementation and consistencies.  It must not only 
<br/>be for an election year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see that the honourable Minister has removed paternal and family care 
<br/>leave.  I  would not  have fussed about  that had the Government  provided stability of employment, 
<br/>especially in the civil service.  I am receiving complaints from the civil service, especially those at 
<br/>the Ministry of Education, honourable Minister for Education, saying that a lot of them are sitting on 
<br/>six months contracts. I can name the department if the honourable Minister for Education wants to 
<br/>refute that.  I raise this because I wonder if this practice is known and accepted by Government. No 
<br/>employer must subject its workers to this kind of inhumane employment condition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the past, I had asked the Government to be consistent by giving a minimum 
<br/>of three-year term contracts to civil servants to allow them quality of life. I note that in recent days, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>838 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Prime Minister had highlighted the pass rates of rural schools that seems to have fared 
<br/>better than urban schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must congratulate all hardworking teachers  and  heads of schools in  this country.  While 
<br/>some  incentives  have  been  reinstated  for  them,  many  more  continue  to  suffer  from  depressing 
<br/>working conditions.  Some heads of schools in the secondary school sector may be losing their jobs 
<br/>by 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2022 should they not be called for a job test which is a requirement set by the Ministry 
<br/>of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had raised this question in this august House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as to why only some people 
<br/>are being called for a job test, while others with equally impressive qualifications and experience are 
<br/>being overlooked.  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have names of schools where these possible practices 
<br/>are being inflicted.  I am reliably informed that even the Teachers Union have raised this issue with 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr, Speaker, Sir, Government must be an equal opportunity employer and, again, I question 
<br/>whether these inequitable practices are known to Government.  The legacy of leaders must always 
<br/>be your ability to walk the talk and ensure equitable distribution of wealth from all sectors in Fiji and 
<br/></span><span>not just favouring a particular province, for example. Anything less, screens discrimination, nepotism 
<br/></span><span>and  cronyism,  which  ultimately  robs  the  nation  of  an  aspired  workforce,  an  ingenious  pool  of 
<br/>entrepreneurs and supresses creativity and productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, generally speaking, there remains a depressed environment in the area of 
<br/>housing in Fiji, as we all know. Whilst we appreciate the assistance being provided for first home 
<br/>owners, we need to conduct a special audit on the budget provided for this scheme since its inception 
<br/>and its effective implementation, given the amount of requirement that is usually demanded from the 
<br/>applicants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been raising with Government to consider imposing a 
<br/>price cap for real estate sales around Fiji, to allow for the level of income in Fiji and to commensurate 
<br/>with the affordability of housing prices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had warned about the deplorable living conditions, especially university students receiving 
<br/>housing allowances - some who have had to rent in squatter settlements because of affordability. This 
<br/>goes back to the fact that housing prices are just too high.  The honourable Minister of Economy may 
<br/>suggest that this is market-driven but history is there for a reason and for us to learn from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Developed  nations,  like  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  Singapore  are  now  a  market  for  the 
<br/>wealthy and the elite where the entry of real estate companies have skyrocketed prices in the housing 
<br/>industry, making and buying a home a very rare dream to achieve.  Fiji is only a developing nation 
<br/>and we have seen international real estate companies entering our domestic markets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister in his address last night said that the real estate market will now be 
<br/>regulated, limiting commissions charged by real estate agents on residential properties to no more 
<br/>than 2 per cent of the sale value. While this would mean a very small difference to the continued 
<br/>escalation of housing prices, I reiterate that Government has to have political guts to impose a cap 
<br/>on real  estate houses, for example,  standard sets of homes in  certain  areas, like Namadi  Heights, 
<br/>should not sell for more than a specific ceiling.  We have to be humane and logical about this, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of areas for improvement needed in this Budget, especially in the 
<br/>areas of monitoring and implementation.  I am happy to see the extension of provision of electricity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>839 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be provided hopefully to areas like Waisa, Naterumai, Waisere, Nawaisomo and the other areas 
<br/>around Fiji where work has already started and villagers are waiting eagerly to switch on the power 
<br/>and receive electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst we talk about infrastructure, some landowners in Naitasiri have raised 
<br/>with me that their current lease arrangements for the electricity towers that runs from Monasavu to 
<br/>Cunningham is being a measly rate of $200 plus every four to six months.  The landowners are well 
<br/>aware of the revenue generated from the provision of electricity to homes and the greater CBD areas 
<br/>along the mentioned corridor and they are crying for an equitable return for the use of their resources 
<br/>over the last 44 years and in the future, especially when restrictions have been placed on them on the 
<br/>use of this land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I also throw in the plight of the landowners of Wailoa Power Station who are also crying 
<br/>for the proper leasing and compensation of those buildings and infrastructure on their land.  I remind 
<br/>this House that the landowners of Wailoa Power Station are a separate landowning unit from the 
<br/>Monasavu Dam landowners.  The manner in which compensation has been paid in acknowledgement 
<br/>for the provision of electricity from Monasavu Dam has totally ignored the contribution from the 
<br/>landowning units of Wailoa Power Station where they have hosted not only the hydro power station 
<br/></span><span>but  also  staff quarters  for  Energy  Fiji  Limited.   This  is  a long standing  act  of discrimination and 
<br/></span><span>deprivation to the landowning units of Wailoa and I ask the honourable Prime Minister to, please, 
<br/>intercede on this issue since earlier communication to the line Minister and to EFL has not yielded 
<br/>any results or responses, at least.  Mr. Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>I learnt by saying that Government officials, including 
<br/>Ministers are servants of the people and they must respond to those raising issues to them, especially 
<br/>from fellow Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, we acknowledge the new and continued initiative highlighted in 
<br/>this Revised Budget, given that it is only four months until the end of the Government fiscal year to 
<br/>31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2022.  I hope that this would be a good year for everyone, especially our voters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  fellow  Fijians;  I  thank  you,  Sir,  for 
<br/>allowing me to take the floor to deliver my statement in support of the Revised 2021-2022 National 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Minister responsible for Commerce, Trade, Tourism, 
<br/>Transport  and  Town  Planning,  I  wholeheartedly  support  the  revised  Budget  presented  by  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Attorney-General and Minister of Economy.  A lot has been said about the purpose of 
<br/></span><span>the special revised Budget but what people forget is that, the revised budget is to bolster our economic 
<br/>recovery in the post-pandemic period.  How short a memory does the Opposition have?                
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, it was said during the 2021-2022 National Budget Address that the Government will 
<br/>review and revise the Budget according to our recovery and that is all that is being done, Sir, there is 
<br/>nothing sinister about this.  Yet, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have lived by the expectations of the 
<br/>Fijian people.  We have understood their needs and we have delivered. For this particular side of the 
<br/>House, it is about the continued welfare of the Fijian people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from what I see, it is difficult for the Opposition to comprehend that the 
<br/>Revised Budget has not shifted the policies of the Fijian Government.  Our policies and our direction 
<br/>from day one have remained consistent and resilient.  It has been the consistent, proactive, resilient 
<br/>policies  and  initiatives  that  have  led  to  consistent  economic  growth  which  led  to  robust  MSMEs 
<br/>creating a thriving middle income class. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  because  of  our  consistent  policies  and  vision,  we  have  received 
<br/>overwhelming support from international partners.  If our partners did not have the confidence in 
<br/>what the Fijian Government is doing and that we will succeed, they would never have provided the 
<br/>funding. It is actually quite astonishing that only the Opposition is not understanding what is being 
<br/>done, everyone else seems to understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition, honestly, truthfully has no idea of how a Government must 
<br/>function. I shudder to think what would happen if they were sitting on this side of the House. They 
<br/>keep changing their tune on a daily basis - they change their tune here, they change their tune outside 
<br/>the House, it seems like they have no tune at all, their instruments really need retuning, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, until last night, the Opposition claimed that the minimum wage was not 
<br/>sufficient for unskilled workers to survive. But today, the honourable Leader of the Opposition claims 
<br/>that  the  gradual  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  to  $4  per  hour  will  be  difficult  for  small 
<br/>manufacturers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want the people of Fiji to know that your interest have actually become 
<br/></span><span>irrelevant on that side of the House. If it is not suiting their agenda, they will change at the drop of a 
<br/></span><span>hat and it is actually visible, Sir, it is absolutely visible;in this House it is visible, in the newspapers 
<br/>it is visible outside the House, change at the drop of a hat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our recovery process as the honourable Attorney-General and the Minister 
<br/>of Economy stated was  each day at  a time, we  had no choice but  to  do  that.  We made the hard 
<br/>decisions, just like the honourable Prime Minister pointed out this morning.  We trusted the science 
<br/>to support our decisions and today, we are here with a budget that will turbo-charge our recovery.  
<br/>The  positive  recovery  trajectory  since  the  opening  of  the  border  in  December  2021  has  ignited 
<br/>confidence that our rebound will be better than expected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last two years and the last two budgets, our focus for the tourism 
<br/>sector has been on restarting. For that to happen, our national objective was to get 80 per cent of the 
<br/>eligible population fully vaccinated and we did just that and more. Today, our international borders 
<br/>are open, Fijians have returned to work, more hotels and businesses are opening and our economy is 
<br/>back on track to building back.  It is in this Revised Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our focus will be to 
<br/>shift from reopening to recovery</span><span> </span><span>of the Fijian tourism industry. Since our borders have opened on 1st 
<br/>December last year, we have welcomed back 50,742 visitors. Over 90 per cent of those visitors were 
<br/></span><span>from Australia and the US markets alone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we approach our peak months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expect these numbers to increase and 
<br/>fuel the recovery. With more markets opening up as we all know, just like New Zealand, we expect 
<br/>even  more  visitors  but  just  as  we  have  opened  up,  so  have  our  competitors.  As  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy stated, we need to be there fighting for our share of the tourist dollar because 
<br/>if we do not, we will all miss out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now easing our entry conditions alongside many other countries to 
<br/>remain competitive.  That is why we have made policy changes to, firstly, ensure we are attractive to 
<br/>tourists  and,  secondly,  to  ensure  that  the  industry  who  are  at  ease  that  supports  our  goal  to  be 
<br/>competitive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the removal of the travel partner classification, irrespective of where you come from, 
<br/>you will be bound by the same conditions.  We are basing this on assurance that we are a highly 
<br/>vaccinated nation.  Anyone who comes is vaccinated with a negative COVID-19 test.  So from 7th 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>841 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>April, all a visitor to Fiji needs to do, is to pre-book a Rapid Antigen Test for their 24 hour in-country 
<br/>test.    This  policy  shift  also  creates  transparency  where  all  service  providers  (whether  a  hotel, 
<br/>laboratory or a pharmacy), list their prices online.  This way, we are giving visitors the option to 
<br/>choose where they want to book their test. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How the system actually works, Sir, there will be an online test booking platform which will 
<br/>centralise all the testing services.  So, for example,  if I am booked to stay at Hilton, I can go online 
<br/>and either book my test with a laboratory, pharmacy or in-house at the Hilton, or somewhere in Nadi 
<br/>Town, if I see that as a cheaper option.  If I intend to visit my family in Lautoka, I no longer have to 
<br/>stay at a hotel.  Instead, I go online and look up laboratories and pharmacies around the area and 
<br/>book.  To ensure that there are no defaulters who do not turn up for their test, we will have in place 
<br/>fixed penalties.  Over the next few days, the Ministry will support the industry to get through this 
<br/>transition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we first started the Blue Lane Initiative in 2020, it was the only means 
<br/>of getting visitors into Fiji.  At that time, Denarau Marina was our only designated port of entry for 
<br/>yachts.  Today, yachts can come from Denarau, Savusavu and Vuda Marinas, and they can do so 
<br/>without having to get the approval of the COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce.  Instead, they declare 
<br/></span><span>their interest directly with the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service, as was the practice pre-COVID.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further support the industry, we are maintaining the low taxes so that is 
<br/>reflected in how we package and sell Fiji.   With the numbers picking up from next month, we are 
<br/>going to ramp up our marketing efforts, and Tourism Fiji’s increase in the marketing allocation of 
<br/>$893,000, an increase of $700,000 for operations will help us over the next few months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  continue  on  our  path  to  full  recovery,  we  must  also  seize  the 
<br/>opportunities  that come with  it.  And as we have  heard  yesterday, we need to  seize these reform 
<br/>opportunities to meet new demands, leveraging technology and creating flexibility. We have, over 
<br/>the past few months, identified areas of improvement to support building and construction activities 
<br/>in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendments to the Town Planning Act is the beginning of the gradual process towards 
<br/>a fully digitalised system or Project bizFIJI 2.0.  The streamlined processes and procedures allow us 
<br/>to ease doing business, especially at a time where we need economic activities to thrive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the change to the town scheme amendment process is a big step towards 
<br/></span><span>achieving a more simplified process.  By reducing process timelines from three months to 14 days 
<br/></span><span>for the whole of scheme revision, and from 30 days to 21 days for individual scheme amendment 
<br/>applications, we are not doing something out of the blue.  In fact, we are bringing Fiji on par with 
<br/>other jurisdictions, such as Queensland, Australia, where the public notification period is between 15 
<br/>to 25 business days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those amendments and the digital system, we are modernising Government processes 
<br/>in the setting of benchmark for service excellence and efficiency  in the building and construction 
<br/>sphere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government understands with a great deal of compassion the struggles of Fijians 
<br/>to make ends meet.  Many MSMEs have taken the initiative to start up home-based businesses and 
<br/>to earn a living. In order to support theat initiatives, as stated in the budget, home-based businesses 
<br/>can  now  operate  from  residential  zones,  without  having  to  rezone.    This  means  that  these 
<br/>entrepreneurs will not be required to make an application for scheme amendment to the Municipal 
<br/>Councils.  As control measures, these home-based businesses will, of course, be bound by certain 
<br/>conditions.

<div><span>As  we  are  relaxing  these  requirements,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  want  Fijians  to  take 
<br/>responsibility too also.  So that means you should not inconvenience your neighbours and you cannot 
<br/>operate any non-commercial business in a residential area, like opening a garage in a residential area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  growth  in  the  building  and  construction  sector  is  a  strong  indicator  of  growth  in  the 
<br/>economy. We will continue to undertake reforms and improvements that will ease the burden on our 
<br/>developers and homeowners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  quite  concerned  with  operations  in  the  Fijian  real  estate 
<br/>industry. Since about 2018, over 90 complaints have been received by the Consumer Council of Fiji 
<br/>and the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board.  Many of those are related to the inconsistencies of the 
<br/>commission  rates  and  the  lack  of  professionally  trained  and  experienced  licensed  agents.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this affects Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, with the emerging trends and irregularities of the purchases and sales of properties, the 
<br/>Government  has  developed  provisions  to  protect  our  consumers  and  our  first-home  buyers.  
<br/>Compared to international markets, commission rates charged by agents in Fiji are actually towards 
<br/>a much higher end. In fact, it ranges from 3 per cent and as high as 25 per cent sometimes of the total 
<br/></span><span>value  of  the  property  whereas  in  jurisdictions,  like  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  the  market 
<br/></span><span>commissions are up to only 5 per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore, reducing the commission on residential  properties will enable 
<br/>prices of properties to be maintained at a reasonable level, which means Fijians will be able to afford 
<br/>a decent home without being ripped off.  So everyday everyday, Fijians will benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the heart of our policies also are MSMEs and the Trade Enhancement 
<br/>Programme (TEP) initiative was developed through consultations with MSMEs and by listening to 
<br/>the people, the TEP aims to expand our economic base and strengthen our domestic trading activities. 
<br/>Whether it is a tailor asking for new sewing machines or someone asking for some farming materials 
<br/>which does not cost much, this programme is for those Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to strongly emphasise that this is not a handout gimmick, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not 
<br/>do that. Our grassroot programmes have always been appreciated and continue to be successful.   In 
<br/>fact,  75  per  cent  of  our  recipients  were  operationally  successful.  Obviously,  all  businesses, 
<br/>particularly  MSMEs  have  been  impacted  by  COVID  but  our  programmes  serve  their  purposes. 
<br/>Additionally the TEP initiative will supplement other MSME related programmes such as the Young 
<br/></span><span>Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES), Integrated Human Resources Development Programme (IHRDP), 
<br/></span><span>Northern Development Programme and the National Export Strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From a transport perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we welcome the policy changes that are being 
<br/>announced in the budget as this will ensure that the people of Fiji are able to provide the much needed 
<br/>care and services through carriers and shuttle service whilst at the same time, also providing the basic 
<br/>necessities for their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  policy  changes  have  been  established  to  ensure  that  processes  are 
<br/>streamlined  and  centralised  requirements.  This  will  enable  agencies  such  as  the  Land  Transport 
<br/>Authority (LTA) to ease the way they serve their customers and at the same time, reduce customer 
<br/>serving and waiting times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As indicated by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister of Economy, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Open Taxi Ranking System (OTRS) is a reform being undertaken after 33 years of running 
<br/>the base and stand system for taxi operators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>843 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the ranking system, taxis will operate on a First-In-First-Out basis or rotational basis at the 
<br/>ranks literally exactly what happens around the world. That means that the first taxi to arrive at any 
<br/>rank will take on the passengers and when taxis arrive at the ranks they will have access to passengers 
<br/>and move out and then queue up for the last taxi on its return at any allocated rank.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also urge our taxi commuters and passengers that will also mean that they will need to 
<br/>change their way of how they use taxis. This in a way will help ease our congestion and have a more 
<br/>orderly manner on our roads particularly with taxi services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  stated  earlier,  the  Revised  Budget  is  there  to  boost  Fiji’s  economic 
<br/>recovery process. It is about putting our people first.  We will continue doing that no matter what it 
<br/>takes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, might I also just take a few minutes to say a little bit about the Ministry of 
<br/>Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation in the absence of the Honourable Minister.  The Ministry 
<br/>of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  has  received  a  budget  allocation  of  about  $138.5 
<br/>million.  The Social Protection Programme makes up the largest portion of the Ministry’s  budget 
<br/>allocation.  Why?  Because it goes directly to the most vulnerable, including children, persons with 
<br/></span><span>disability and the elderly.  It is across life spectrum from cradle to the grave.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is, therefore, important that the Government continues to ensure that at no stage in life will 
<br/>a Fijian be ostracized on their crib.  Instead, every Fijian is given the opportunity to access support 
<br/>from a Government that ensures their wellbeing and welfare.  The Ministry is actually very happy 
<br/>with  their  new  budget  that  will  help  maintain  the  current  Social  Protection  Programmes  which 
<br/>include the Social Pension Schemes, Poverty Benefit Scheme, Care and Protection Allowance, Rural 
<br/>Pregnant Mothers Programme and the Disability Allowance Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the newly filled position of National Coordinator for Social Welfare Reform 
<br/>shows  the  Government’s  commitment  to  provide  greater  functionality  and  strengthening 
<br/>accountability and improve data management through digitisation, as highlighted by the honourable 
<br/>Minister  of  Economy.    Furthermore,  the  Ministry  will  also  restart  the  Annual  Re-Certification 
<br/>Programme to validate the eligibility of social welfare recipients.  In this way, we can ensure there is 
<br/>no duplication or misuse of Social Protection Scheme funds, thus ensuring that our assistance benefit 
<br/>Fijians who actually need it most. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been working diligently to ease the burden on Fijians in whichever 
<br/></span><span>way we can.  Bus fare recipients can now expect the monthly Bus Fare Assistance to increase from 
<br/></span><span>$10 a month to $25 a month with an allocation of $6 million benefiting over 40,000 odd Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the senior citizens have significantly contributed to where we are today as 
<br/>a nation and it is only right that in their golden age where they need love and care, we continue our 
<br/>duty of care and the three golden age homes located in Samabula, Lautoka and Labasa will receive 
<br/>budgets with Labasa now in its final stage of renovation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further to the grants to the organisations, the Ministry will strengthen its partnership with 
<br/>organisations whose activities and outputs support the Ministry’s strategic objectives.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  the  Poverty  Monitoring  Unit  under  the  Ministry,  through  the  Integrated  National  Poverty 
<br/>Eradication Programme (INPEP) received an allocation of $185,000 and with this they will continue 
<br/>to monitor, evaluate and report on the progress and impacts of Government’s Poverty Alleviation 
<br/>Programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the budget.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.04 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with our agenda item.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Members of Cabinet and fellow honourable Members; firstly, 
<br/>I  would  like  to  welcome  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  back  after  recovering  from  a  successful 
<br/>surgery in Melbourne and I pray for his good health and abundant blessing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to share my condolences to you and your family and the </span><span>vanua</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>o </span><span>Kubuna on the passing of your youngest brother, Ratu Keni Vuiyasawa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution to the Bill before Parliament which I will 
<br/>describe  as  an  election  stunt,  cosmetic  touch  to  winning  the  confidence  of  this  beleaguered 
<br/>Government, a band-aid solution to problems created by this uncaring Government and one that has 
<br/>too little and too late delivery to bring any relief to the plight of the ordinary people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Supplementary Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a gamble undertaken by this Government 
<br/></span><span>after getting a good rub during the budget consultations, pacify an angry electorate whose discontent 
<br/></span><span>with this Government, its leadership, its policies and programmes were at brazen display.  Now, with 
<br/>the campaign period opening up for the next Election, next month, they are attempting to hide all 
<br/>their sins and omissions under the guise of this Budget to make up an image of a caring government 
<br/>when the fact remains that they are the same wolf in a new sheep skin. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, on one hand, we are made to acknowledge the impacts of the natural disasters, monstrous 
<br/>pandemic and effects of global economic scene while on the other, economic recovery resultant from 
<br/>the Bainimarama Boom.  The question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is if there is indeed a Bainimarama Boom 
<br/>then –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Why do we continue to rely heavily on borrowing and budget support? 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Why do we need a Band-Aid solution on direct taxation? 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Why has the quality of life and standard of living of our people remain stagnant or has gone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>worse?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Why has our GDP and GDP per capita shrunk in the last two years? 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Why is our social and public infrastructure and utility in shambles, creating a daily havoc 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for our people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No water and patched roads are problems we face daily.  Honourable Vijay Nath can attest to that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from my many calls that he has received about lack of water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  hard,  cold  fact  remains,  which  our  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  refused  to 
<br/>acknowledge,  are  more  than  one  finding  after  another  by  the  ILO  and  lately  the  ADB  -  the  gross 
<br/>mismanagement of our economy by this Government and its egocentric leadership and melodramatic 
<br/>policies, good at not solving the problems of the nation and its people.  That is the root cause of our 
<br/>economic decline and deluge.  It is a heavy price we are now forced to pay for the populist stunts by this 
<br/>Government which boomeranged on its face.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Had  this  Government  managed  public  finances  and  State  assets  and  machinery  prudently,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, was thrift about economic development than mere handouts, committed to developing our 
<br/>resource-based sectors than relying on tourism, concentrated on the needs of the ordinary people than 
<br/>massaging the cause of the elite class and upholding the ideals and principles of good governance, our 
<br/>situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be much, much better today.  We would not need a revised Budget like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>846 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this to create smokescreen to baffle our people and hoodwink them with the maxim that all is well.  We 
<br/>are on the path of recovery when the truth is our economy continues to limp towards a certain catastrophe 
<br/>under the leadership of this Government  and  we  are  engrossed deeply  in its own string  of  deceptive 
<br/>propaganda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  education  sector,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Minister  for  Education  is  duty-bound  to 
<br/>urgently  call  a  National  Education  Summit  either  in  person  or  via  virtual  meeting  with  all  the 
<br/>stakeholders to disclose plans and work out logistics and strategies for our schools, and moreso deal 
<br/>with the completion of teaching syllabus and the promotion of our students. At the same time, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  for  the  stakeholders  in  the  Fiji  education  sector  to  take  interest  and 
<br/>proactively participate in any consultation process initiated by the Ministry of Education and to give 
<br/>frank views rather than supporting the ideas floated by the Ministry just to appease the Government 
<br/>of  the  day.    Everyone  has  a  duty  to  this  nation  insofar  as  our  teaching  and  learning  process  is 
<br/>concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FijiFirst  Government  in  its  attempt  to  please  the  students  already 
<br/>learning  under  TELS  and  the  prospective  students  to  be  included  in  the  initiative  has,  by  the 
<br/>pronouncements made  in  this  Budget,  demonstrated  to  us  beyond  all  reasonable  doubt,  how  they 
<br/></span><span>want to introduce discrimination by marking criteria for certain course work to qualify for the grant 
<br/></span><span>of TELS.  This is making a mockery of equal opportunities, right to self-determination in education 
<br/>and is going to jeopardise the interests and aspirations of hundreds of our young men and women.  
<br/>The  TSLB  has  a  competent  CEO  and  I  suggest  that  they  are  left  alone  to  map  out  the  strategies 
<br/>especially with further cut-off marks to 200 with no interference from the government of the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  next  issue  on  which  I  intend  to  speak  is  the  gradual  increase  in  the 
<br/>National Minimum Wage which we welcome with reservations.  It is amusing to witness this Revised 
<br/>Budget, how the money from the pockets of the ordinary people are taken away by taxes, duties, 
<br/>tariffs, fees, fines and other levies and yet when it comes to putting money into the pockets of the 
<br/>people, it is not instant as it is taken but rather gradual.  Keeping the high cost of living in mind, I 
<br/>think it warrants an explanation on this gradual increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Revised Budget may have raised some hopes and given hype to myths 
<br/>on our economic recovery but judging by the track record of this Government on the implementation 
<br/>of its pledges and policies, the goodies remain a castle in the air, a pie in the sky and a carrot dangled 
<br/>at our people to once again mislead them to vote for FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had stated in this House advocating the importance of providing opportunities for our young 
<br/></span><span>to have the necessary skills and I thank the honourable Minister of Economy in realising the shortage 
<br/>in the building trades.  There is nothing new in this Budget; rural allowance, boarding allowance has 
<br/>been  with  us  during  the  past  governments.    This  is  a  budget  put  up  due  to  desperation  and  my 
<br/>colleagues on the Government side should start thinking and packing.  No amount of “Hear, hear” 
<br/>and banging the desk in this Parliament will make any difference.  This Government is on the way 
<br/>out.  The flowery announcement looks promising but where will the money come from to implement 
<br/>the budget commitments? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- You do not worry about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- We will not worry about it because right now, when we come to 
<br/>Government, we will have to worry about it.  When talking about fools in the Budget announcement, 
<br/>we will see who will fall in this category after the 2022 Election.  The trick of freebies and fear-
<br/>mongering worked for them in 2014 and 2018, and they think our people are vulnerable enough that 
<br/>it will work for them again this year.  Let me finish off by a sagely and timely reminder to them 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>847 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quoting from a Russian who had this to write for those who take the goodwill of their people for 
<br/>granted and I quote: “You can fool some people some of the time, some people all the time but not 
<br/>all the people all the time”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me again quote: “Those in power must empower the people.  The 
<br/>moment you rob the people of their power it will not be long when the people will rob you off your 
<br/>power.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians,  I rise to respond to the 2021-
<br/>2022 Revised Budget.  I thank the honourable Attorney-General and the Minister of Economy for 
<br/>the post-COVID economic and social recovery budget. The Revised 2021-2022 National Budget is 
<br/>a continuation of the Fijian Government’s commitment to Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  stated  recovery  is  underway,  as  shown  by  many 
<br/>indicators, including the 25,000 jobs added to the formal sector and a similar number in the informal 
<br/>sector, as well as the increase in hotel bookings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ordinary Fijians must be given relief from the external shock that has pushed 
<br/></span><span>the price of basic needs such as fuel and food. This budget provides relief to ordinary consumers to 
<br/>adjust the cost of living through increase in minimum wage rate,  zero rating of VAT on 21 basic 
<br/>consumer items, reduction in fuel duty, increased allocation for TELS, restoration of rural allowance 
<br/>and many more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not  too  long  ago,  honourable  Leawere  did  question  about  the  restoration  of  the  rural 
<br/>allowance and I remember that very clearly.  Today, he did not even acknowledge that the restoration 
<br/>of the rural allowance have been made, despite the current situation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The budget that was delivered, focused on social recovery from the 
<br/>economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine that has pushed the price 
<br/>of  goods  and services.   Considering that  the  crisis  affects not  only  Fiji,  but  the whole world, the 
<br/>Government has realistically and comprehensively addressed issues across the board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation for my two ministries have been increased. The 2021-2022 
<br/>Revised  Budget  has  kept  the  funding  for  the  sanitary  pad  initiative.    This  initiative  is  part  of  the 
<br/>Government’s  commitment  to  promote  the  safe  menstrual  health  of  our  girls.    This  initiative  is 
<br/>keeping our girls in schools. Each year, the Government allocates an average of $60 million in Free 
<br/>Education Grant to schools.  To equip our Heads of Schools better with financial management skills 
<br/>and knowledge, the Ministry has rolled out the Online Financial Management course, to ensure a 
<br/>high level of compliance with the Financial Guidelines.  We are targeting to complete the training of 
<br/>the rest of the Heads of Schools in the upcoming months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the global shift towards adoption of technology in Education, it is imperative that the 
<br/>Ministry continues to evolve and embrace technology to enhance teaching and learning.  In order for 
<br/>us to achieve this, it is important that schools are connected to the internet.  This was made possible 
<br/>through  the  Government’s  initiative  of  connecting  the  unconnected  communities  by  providing 
<br/>connectivity to 26 rural-remote schools in the Northern Division.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  good  education  requires  good  school  infrastructure,  including  teacher’s 
<br/>quarters. The Ministry received an additional $2.4 million for capital works in the Revised Budget to 
<br/>improve  or  build  teacher’s  quarters,  ablution  blocks  and  driveways  for  schools  in  remote  rural 
<br/>schools.  The  Ministry  continues  to  encourage  teachers  to  upgrade  their  qualifications.  While  the 
<br/>Opposition and Union created negativity and uncertainty amongst teachers, but teachers understand 
<br/>the importance of upgrading their qualifications.  The Ministry has been allocated an additional $1.7 
<br/>million to increase the salaries of teachers who have upgraded their qualifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry welcomes new policy announcements and initiatives pertaining to TSLS. Given 
<br/>the  circumstances  faced  by  Year  13  students,  temporarily  lowering  the  cut-off  marks  for  TSLS 
<br/>awards to 250, except for Commerce category will allow more students to enter tertiary institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  must  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  express  my  disappointment  with  the  </span><span>Fiji  Times</span><span>  and 
<br/>Communications Fiji Limited (CFL) and </span><span>fijivillage</span><span> for irresponsible and unethical journalistic behaviour.  
<br/>Those two media organisations isolated a single comment and presented it without context, insinuating it 
<br/>was directed at the student in question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  role  of  the  National  Toppers  Scheme’s  is  to  enable  the  Government  to 
<br/></span><span>strengthen sectors of the economy where employees are needed by providing scholarships for students 
<br/></span><span>seeking an education in those fields.  It is to ensure that the gaps in under-served economic sectors in Fiji 
<br/>are  filled,  so  we  have  enough  engineers,  pharmacists,  laboratory  technicians,  nurses,  plumbers, 
<br/>electricians and agricultural specialists and many more to keep our nation progressing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are investing in students, not just for them to attain higher education, but also making sure 
<br/>that they  get into  areas  which offer better job  prospects and, of course, meet  Fiji’s needs.   This is  a 
<br/>common-sense based and practical initiative to provide support for those sectors where there is a demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Predictably, honourable Professor Prasad has jumped on CFL and  </span><span>Fiji Times’</span><span> sensationalised 
<br/>misinformation. It is common knowledge that CFL and </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> will provide headlines for NFP on 
<br/>statements from Government Ministers in a negative way - many a times commenting without due care 
<br/>on the context of the statement.  Can honourable Professor Prasad explain to law students why they are 
<br/>not eligible for NTS? Can they explain to students in other fields that are oversupplied with graduates 
<br/>why they have not received scholarships? Do they not have aspirations and dreams?  What about those 
<br/>students who have been adhering to this policy and understand why this criteria was applied?  There are 
<br/>over 500 students studying law at the three universities in Fiji. Can the honourable Professor Prasad go 
<br/>and explain to the hundreds of law students why he is only pushing for MBBS scholarships and not LLB 
<br/></span><span>scholarships? We urge everyone to think about national priorities. Under the 2013 Constitution, everyone 
<br/></span><span>is treated fairly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Bainimarama-led Government, education was made free up to the 
<br/>end  of  secondary  school  and  university  education  is  subsidized  with  extremely  cheap  loans  and 
<br/>scholarships.  In 2019, three years ago, Fiji had crossed the World Health Organization’s threshold of one 
<br/>doctor for every 1,000 people.  However with the change in dynamics caused by the pandemic, TSLS 
<br/>reviewed the policies based on needs not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. I must 
<br/>say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the TSLS is a statutory body which is governed by the Board and it has its own 
<br/>CEO, they do their own due diligence, surveillance, research and fact finding – that is when they are able 
<br/>to either increase or decrease a particular quota.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the regulation for TSLS is very clear.  It simply says that if a quota is not filled, 
<br/>then TSLS can reduce the marks to fill the quota.  So that provision is there and TSLS can use that 
<br/>provision whenever it is needed.  It is very important for TSLS to consider Fiji’s needs when it comes to 
<br/>giving scholarships or giving loans for their studies.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>849 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I would like to highlight, there is shortage of teachers in special and inclusive education - 
<br/>ECE and primary teaching and what are we doing about it?  What we have done, we have increased the 
<br/>scholarship in this area and we are encouraging Year 13 students, if they wish to join the teaching field, 
<br/>this is the area they should be applying for because they will get the job immediately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in secondary school, there is a shortage of teachers in Maths, Physics, 
<br/>Computing, Physical Education, Music, Arts and Industrial Arts.  We also have surplus teachers in the 
<br/>fields of Chemistry, Biology, Accounting, Economics, Agriculture, et cetera.  These are the teachers who 
<br/>graduated from 2018, 2019 and they are still applying for a job but we do not have a vacancy, Sir, so 
<br/>those are the constraints we are facing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I would like to highlight one simple point here that the dynamics of workforce is changing 
<br/>globally.  I am sure the Opposition have heard about mass resignations taking place in certain countries 
<br/>around the globe.  It is after COVID-19 that the job seekers have decided that they do not wish to be 
<br/>employed anymore and that has created a lot of shortages in the market.  Today, we see that our people 
<br/>who are well skilled are being recruited by companies in Australia, New Zealand, US and other places. 
<br/>So based on those needs, definitely the dynamic has changed and, therefore, we have to increase the 
<br/>number of scholarships and also reduce the marks so that we can fill the quota and get our workforce 
<br/></span><span>ready.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  moving  on  to  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  the  13  Municipal 
<br/>Councils are working closely with the Department of Town and Country Planning to accelerate block 
<br/>rezoning, building and subdivision in areas where growth pressure has been realised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the effects of the pandemic, market vendors stall fees was paid by 
<br/>Government to the Municipal Councils. This was done to provide some relief to over 8,000 vendors. 
<br/>In this Budget, an additional $2.6 million has been allocated to extend the waiver of fees to all kiosks 
<br/>and sweet cart operators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $2.5 million has been allocated in this financial year to pay base 
<br/>fees for PSV owners. This allocation has, again, strengthened the revenue stream of the Council and 
<br/>support the operations and infrastructure projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  removal  of  business  licence  has  contributed  towards  ease  of  doing 
<br/>businesses  as  well  as  investments.  The  provision  of  business  licence  grant  to  small  Municipal 
<br/>Councils will continue with the service delivery without any disruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  pandemic  has  had  a  huge  impact  on  the  implementation  of  capital 
<br/>projects due to supply chain disruption and travel restriction.  Despite the hurdles, the Ministry of 
<br/>Local Government will continue to implement capital projects that make our towns and cities more 
<br/>vibrant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  a  sum of $348,000 has been  allocated towards the maintenance of Ratu 
<br/>Cakobau Park, particularly Pavilion B to improve the stadium and its facilities for sporting purposes. 
<br/>Work  on  Pavilion  A  is  already  complete  but  the  work  on  Pavilion  B  requires  additional  funding 
<br/>which has come through this budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also progressing with our Nakasi Farmers Market. The market is targeted 
<br/>to assist farmers and to provide the much needed fresh vegetables, root crops and fruits to the people 
<br/>around  Nakasi  and  Davuilevu.    A  budget  allocation  of  $300,000  will  ensure  that  the  market  is 
<br/>completed in a timely manner.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funding of $81,000 has been allocated to Namaka Market complex and 
<br/>this amount will help in completing the remaining works which was mainly the car park area so that 
<br/>the Council can start generating some revenue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  turn  to  some  of  the  comments  that  were  made  earlier  and 
<br/>particularly on OMRS.  It appeared as if OMRS is only used in the teaching field or in the education 
<br/>sector but let me clarify that OMRS is for the whole of civil service.  It is an equitable transparent 
<br/>process just like any other sector, employers select the best person for the job.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we have been hearing this from the Opposition quite a bit but let me give a bit of a history in terms 
<br/>of how teachers were selected in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, did you know that Union representative sat in the Central Board to strongly 
<br/>advocate for the teacher of their choice?  Why else would they be part of the panel?  It was wrong 
<br/>for them to sit in a panel or even recommend promotion.  Their sitting on the panel led to promoting 
<br/>their favourite teachers, who were Union members, and not those who were not members.  What 
<br/>business does the Union have to sit in this Board to even recommend, particularly in the recruitment 
<br/>process?  I would like to ask, which other Ministry or private sector entertains that? Which Ministry 
<br/>or private sector has a Union representative who makes this recommendation?  We have not heard 
<br/></span><span>of this before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but this was the practice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The system of appointment was flawed with the Union, given the unreasonable leeway to be 
<br/>part of the Board to push their members’ agenda.   The role of the Union is not to recommend who 
<br/>should be appointed, but it is solely the prerogative of the employer.  Unions are not employers of 
<br/>teachers.  This flawed system and processes had been noticed and corrected in 2008, and this has 
<br/>been further streamlined in a very transparent manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to  reiterate that in the OMRS process,  it is  not  just for the 
<br/>Ministry that PS sits, but there are other people who sit on this process and if a person misses out or 
<br/>is not happy with the way the interview was conducted, they have all the right to take the matter to 
<br/>PSC for a review, and that is an open process, unlike what was happening before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of TELS loan was also raised, that the loans are very high and how 
<br/>will they pay the loan.  However, we had streamlined the process and I want to say that  now the 
<br/>interest rate for the Loan Scheme is low, based on household income, including the recipient’s annual 
<br/>income.  For example, if the household income or the recipient’s income is up to $25,000, there is 
<br/>zero interest, in other words you do not pay any interest.  If it is between $25,000 and $50,000, then 
<br/></span><span>it is 0.5 per cent interest and $50,000 to $100,000 is 1 per cent interest.  So the interest amount is 
<br/></span><span>very low.  If the recipient pays in the first two years, they will receive 50 per cent discount, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, we have heard from honourable Leawere and this is a confusion that we normally 
<br/>see with the Opposition.  When we talk about consultation on one hand, we are saying, “Why are 
<br/>you consulting?  You are not consulting enough, you should be having more consultations.  You do 
<br/>not know what is happening in that particular field.”  But when we do consultations, then it is seen 
<br/>as electioneering.  In other words, we are participating or involving ourselves in election but that is 
<br/>not the point because we are the Government, we have to do our job and we are doing our job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  2021-2022  Revised 
<br/>Budget.  At the outset, I will say that I do not support the motion.  After the 2014 General Elections, 
<br/>the very first budget that was brought into Parliament by this Government had the theme, “Turning 
<br/>Promises  into  Deeds.”    In  my  response,  I  had  titled  it,  “Turning  Promises  into  Debts,”  (Turning 
<br/>Promises into </span><span>Dinau). </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>851 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that trend has continued until to date; false promises and high debts.  The 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition in his response this morning had elaborated on our escalating 
<br/>debt level which now sits at about $7.7 billion, equivalent to 79.8 per cent of the GDP. Therefore, I 
<br/>also support the call by the honourable Leader of the Opposition that it is best that we live within our 
<br/>means and according to Calvin Coolidge, I quote:  “There is no dignity quite so impressive and no 
<br/>independence quite so important as living within your means.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also continuously hear the Government side flaunting high economic growth 
<br/>but how does that high economic growth translate to tangible positive impacts to improving the lives 
<br/>of our people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reality of the matter is that people are faced with more poverty, increased unemployment, 
<br/>poor public service delivery in the health, education, housing, local town councils, to name a few.  
<br/>For example, Mr. Speaker, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics clearly captured this in their latest Report of 
<br/>2019 to 2020 and any responsible government would have taken that Report for policy formulation 
<br/>and implementation purposes so as to address these problems but instead this politically motivated 
<br/>and vindictive government sacked Mr. Naiqama, the CEO for simply doing his work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also acknowledged the assistance given out to the various Social Welfare 
<br/></span><span>Programmes  but  a  nagging  issue  which  I  continue  to  raise  in  this  House  is  on  the  subsequent 
<br/>dependency syndrome impact that would be created in the absence of any Workfare Programme to 
<br/>wean able bodied people of the social welfare system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another area of concern is with regard to those who have lost their jobs to COVID-19 and 
<br/>have assisted themselves by accessing their own FNPF, whereby Government has not said anything 
<br/>about  replacing  their  FNPF  contributions  that  has  been  used  up.  Those  that  have  received  direct 
<br/>Government  Top-up  Assistance,  a  lot  of  these  people  are  still  unemployed  and  therefore  will 
<br/>potentially  fall  into  the  social  welfare  programmes  in  the  future.  However,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  also 
<br/>acknowledge the zero VAT food items but people be warned that this will be revised and reviewed 
<br/>as announced by the honourable Minister of Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, moving on to women, the women in our country continue to be disadvantaged.  
<br/>For example, on the latest law that says that women have to change their names in the birth certificate 
<br/>so as to align themselves with the requirements by the Elections Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am happy that a group of women, NGOs have taken their case to the court.  Even though 
<br/></span><span>we hear a lot of talk from the Government side that women have been empowered, that they uphold 
<br/></span><span>the development of women but in reality, Mr. Speaker, speaks otherwise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the increasing rate of Violence Against Women, Mr. Speaker, I have continuously raised 
<br/>this in the House whereby we in the Opposition moved a motion that a commission of inquiry be 
<br/>established  to  look  into  the  increasing  rate  of  violence  against  women  and  children.  But  the 
<br/>Government  themselves  did  not  support it. They  did  not  see it fit that the  commission  of inquiry 
<br/>would be able to constructively put forward recommendations to addressing this big problem in our 
<br/>society.  However, instead of that, they moved a motion that the Auditor-General be investigated for 
<br/>doing his work and presenting into this House a Performance Audit Report of relevant Government 
<br/>agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  urge  the  Government  to  also  move  motions  that  a 
<br/>commission of inquiry be undertaken for the health sector, education sector, agricultural sector, Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority and Water Authority of Fiji.  Let the Auditor-General undertake a performance audit 
<br/>of those agencies and present reports to this House.

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on to the Ministry of Health, during lunch time, I read a Report by 
<br/>the </span><span>Radio New Zealand</span><span> which stated that Fiji has the highest death rate of diabetes in the world.  Sir, 
<br/>it is unbecoming and we cannot just tie up - to have that kind of statement reported by </span><span>Radio New 
<br/>Zealand</span><span> and then we see the honourable Minister for Health going out into the communities, opening 
<br/>toilet blocks in the rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- What is wrong with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Government side does not see anything 
<br/>wrong with that when we hold the highest death rate from diabetes worldwide yet the Minister is out 
<br/>there  doing  all  those  opening  of  toilet  blocks  rather  than  looking  at  policies,  ways  and  means  of 
<br/>addressing this problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am raising this and the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services  and  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  cannot  see  the 
<br/>connection. The connection  is the high economic growth  which they continuously  and constantly 
<br/>flaunt  in  this  House  does  not  translate  to  good  or  successful  implementation  of  public  service 
<br/>delivery, for example, in the health sector.  That is why we are holding the highest death rate from 
<br/>diabetes in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Is that a priority for us, honourable Minister for Health? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It is the people’s choice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Is that a priority for us or the priority is to go and open toilets? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  kinds  of  activities  arise  because  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is now so desperate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- They are desperate.  Instead of looking at policies and making 
<br/>sure that your budgetary allocations are fully utilised, you are out there taking boats, taking horses, 
<br/>what next?  That is not your job, your job is to look at policies and programmes, utilise your budgetary 
<br/>allocation so that you make an improvement in your various portfolios.  That is your duty. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>853 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while still on the health sector, you just have to go to the CWM Hospital 
<br/>and check out the deplorable health infrastructure there.  I had a relative there in the last three weeks.  
<br/>We had to take linen, we had to take cutleries and we had to take food. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am bringing up this issue because that is exactly my point.  Their economic 
<br/>growth  does  not  translate  to  the  improvement  of  our  people’s  lives.    Sir,  there  are  shortages  in 
<br/>essential  medicines  and,  again,  we  hear  the  Free  Medicine  Programme.    In  the  previous  term  of 
<br/>Parliament, the Free Medicine Programme was just in words - patients had to go and buy because 
<br/>those medicine were not available in the various outlets where they are supposed to be provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also we had contacts of nurses or medical officials raising their concerns on 
<br/>the  payment  of  overtime  and  allowances.    We  are  happy  to  hear  it  in  this  Budget  that  it  will  be 
<br/>implemented. But, Sir, in the COVID-19 Supplementary Budget, this was also mentioned but still 
<br/>not everyone has been paid the relevant allowances and overtime. So, my question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Health is to do a national check and all those identified  who are owed overtime and 
<br/>allowances, will they be paid in retrospect?  Will they be back-paid for those overdue allowances? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we welcome that the additional intake for nurses training has been increased but from 
<br/></span><span>a holistic perspective, Mr. Speaker, that demonstrates a poor public sector reform being undertaken.  
<br/></span><span>That is a reactive strategy to human resource need, to the nurses need because the nurses have left.  
<br/>Why  have  our  nurses  left,  honourable  Minister  for  Health?    The  nurses  have  left  because  of 
<br/>unfavourable working conditions, lack of manpower, they are overworked, no overtime pay and no 
<br/>meal allowances.  They are asking, what are you going to do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  we  were  in  Government,  we  would  review  their  working  conditions.    That  is  a  more 
<br/>proactive approach to human resource need, Mr. Speaker.  That is the problem - all is not linked up 
<br/>- the public sector reform and all that is happening in various Ministries and Departments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  acknowledge  the  remittances  that  our  people,  our  families,  our 
<br/>relatives overseas are injecting into our economy.  In my view, this is the biggest lifesaver for us in 
<br/>Fiji right now and in that, I commend our family units, especially in the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities whereby 
<br/>we have </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> and all kinds of arrangements in place which has been able to assist families in 
<br/>their times of great need.  Honourable Minister for Health, I said that because I am only privy to have 
<br/>that kind of full information that I am able to share in the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  conclusion,  I  would  say  that  hearing  this  revised  Budget,  only  fools  will 
<br/></span><span>believe it because false promises have continued from 2015 up until now.  All the false promises!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Honourable  Bala,  you  promised  in  the  House  that  the  Local 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Act will be reviewed.  Nothing has been done!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out a conversation between you two.  Address the Speaker! </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, the revised Budget is sounding more like an election 
<br/>budget and on that note, let us pause for a little while.  I would urge the people that if the freebies, if 
<br/>the  lollies  reach  them,  accept  them  with  a  smile  but  do  not  vote  for  this  Government.    Vote  this 
<br/>Government out in the next election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to express my support 
<br/>for this Budget and I must say it must be quite shocking for a lot of people that have been listening,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to hear the kind of drivel that has been said in this Parliament.  We have heard so many honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side who have said that they do not support this Budget.  So to everyone out 
<br/>there when they heard that we were going to have zero VAT on all those products, this is what they 
<br/>are saying, they would prefer that you pay a higher price for each of those items.  That is what they 
<br/>are saying; honourable Leawere, honourable Aseri Radrodro and honourable Salote Radrodro.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are telling the people of this country, we want you in this time when people are finding 
<br/>it difficult to pay for things, they want you to pay a higher price for each of those items. They are 
<br/>telling the civil servants of this country, this Budget is saying that your meal allowance which used 
<br/>to be $20, which had to be brought down to $10, they want you to keep getting the $10 and not the 
<br/>$15 that this Budget is talking about.  They are telling all the civil servants in this country that are 
<br/>working out in the maritime areas, we have to stop your maritime allowance because of COVID-19, 
<br/>we want you to continue not getting the maritime allowance. That is the kind of thing that they are 
<br/>saying, that is the kind of message they are giving to the people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They do not want what this Government wants  which is to provide support to people that 
<br/>need that support in their hour of need, when the price of food items are going up, the cost of freight 
<br/>is going up and we import so many things into this country, the Government is trying to give a helping 
<br/></span><span>hand  to  people  who  need  that  assistance  and  they  are  saying,  they  should  not  be  getting  that 
<br/></span><span>assistance.  You  are  showing  your  true  colours  and  it  does  not  matter  what  sort  of  assistance 
<br/>Government gives to the people of this country, you just want to rubbish everything that Government 
<br/>does.  Your true colours are being seen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  time  this  Bainimarama-led  Government  started  to  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, it has a record of being a very decisive government in everything that it does.  It has 
<br/>shown over the years that it looks at the context that we face in a particular situation, it assesses that 
<br/>situation, it makes the necessary amendments then it is very decisive about what it does.  It does not 
<br/>dilly it does not dally, it makes a decision and implements it because it sees that that is what needs 
<br/>to be done for the benefit of the people of this country.  As a result of that decisiveness, we had, for 
<br/>the first time ever, nine years of consecutive growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Historic! People have said that the growth was too low.  You will have 
<br/>a lower growth if your base is very low, then it is very easy for you to have high economic growth 
<br/>rates.  When you become a middle income developing country, then the growth rates that you have 
<br/></span><span>are going to be lower.  That is normal in the progression of a country, we have had nine years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the height of COVID-19, we looked after our people, we made sure that the people 
<br/>who needed social welfare still got that social welfare assistance.  There were people on that other 
<br/>side that were making fun of this COVID-19 jabs.  They talked about 666 and what not, they sent 
<br/>false messages to the people of this country not to get the COVID-19 jab.  Imagine if you had listened 
<br/>to that kind of drivel and hogwash that was being spread.  We never did that, we never devalued our 
<br/>currency.  We never even thought about printing our money, imagine if we had devalued our currency 
<br/>at this time of inflation, our money would be almost virtually worthless because we knew what we 
<br/>had to do, we were decisive and we made sure we carried out what we needed to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We decided that we need to manage COVID-19 and at the same time, get ready to get our 
<br/>economy running again; we managed to do those two things.  We managed to raise the vaccination 
<br/>rates of the people in this country.  That is why today, all of us are not wearing masks because we 
<br/>did it.  We did what needed to be done, we told the workers, “no jab, no job”.  We forced that issue 
<br/>through.  Other countries followed suit because we did it.  That is what I am telling you, this is  a 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>855 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government that has proven that it is a decisive one.  When something needs to be done, we do it to 
<br/>the very best of our ability.  That is the kind of thing that we need in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today,  as  I  was  reading  about  the  COVID-19  situation,  there  are  so  many  other  Pacific 
<br/>countries that are now gripped by COVID-19; Samoa, Tonga and all these other countries.  We have 
<br/>managed to go through that and I think the only reason that we have been able to do that because we 
<br/>have listened to people, we have listened to the experts and we have strong decisive leadership that 
<br/>is not afraid to make tough decisions and stick by those tough decisions, no matter what people say, 
<br/>for the benefit of the people of this country; decisive leadership.  That is what we see all along from 
<br/>this side of the House.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Revised Budget addresses the issues of the day. When we do a budget, a budget is not 
<br/>created  in  some  sort  of  vacuum  but  it  is  created  in  some  context.  You  look  around,  you  see  the 
<br/>context,  you  see  what  is  happening  and  you  make  a  budget  at  that  time  based  on  that  particular 
<br/>context.   When the Budget was done at that particular point in time, we knew that things would 
<br/>change.  Things are beginning to change so when things begin to change, do you still use the same 
<br/>plan that you had, it was developed in that particular context or do you adjust it to suit the context 
<br/>that you are in now? Things are beginning to happen now. The tourists are coming back, people are 
<br/></span><span>starting up businesses. We need to change and that is what we are doing in this Budget. We also 
<br/></span><span>know that we have the war in Ukraine and the prices are going up, so what do you do? You adjust it 
<br/>to  address  those  issues.  You  are  saying  we  are  electioneering  -  this  is  not  electioneering.  This  is 
<br/>looking at the needs of the country and having a revised Budget that addresses those precise issues. 
<br/>That is what governments do. They address the issues at hand and this is what this Budget is doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are beginning to make some headway in our economy.  Yes, there are still people who 
<br/>were unemployed as a result of COVID-19, some of them are still unemployed and a lot more people 
<br/>are  beginning  to  be  employed.    If  we  look  at  the  number  of  advertisements  coming  up  in  the 
<br/>newspapers, it shows that jobs are being created and more jobs are opening up so things are beginning 
<br/>to move along.  You have seen the focus that we have on reducing the red tape to get the businesses 
<br/>going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Someone on the other side said that investors have not been coming through. Last week, we 
<br/>were talking to a group of almost 20 investors who flew in from America. That is not a reflection of 
<br/>difficult times when there is no capital around, these people still want to come and invest in Fiji. 
<br/>Why?  Because they recognise that the Government in place is decisive, it wants that investment and 
<br/>they are putting in place the grounds for which they will be able to invest and they can get a return 
<br/></span><span>on their investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the kinds of things that I wanted to say today.  We are beginning to make headway   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where we look at this Revised Budget it is talking about getting rid of red tape, making the processes 
<br/>much better so that investors can come in and create jobs that will benefit everyone in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are giving relief to students. They had to pay back their TELS. We are moving it back to 
<br/>two years because we know that in that two- year period they can take their time. We are assisting 
<br/>farmers who wish to transition from sugar to other agricultural products but we are not abandoning 
<br/>those who wish to remain in the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The development of the national minimum wage. Some people said that they suggested this 
<br/>national minimum wage, five years ago. You make a decision - you look at the context of that point 
<br/>in  time and  you make the decision to  increase the national  minimum wage at  the right  time. Just 
<br/>because you suggested that this should be done 10 years ago, it does not mean that that was the best 
<br/>time to do it. You decide to do it at the right time.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have just gone through COVID-19 now.  The Budget was supposed to be reviewed back 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in 2020, but we had COVID-19 in the interim so that is why it is being done now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the things that I liked about this particular Budget in terms of one 
<br/>of the biggest issues that people always talk about and I admit there are a lot challenges in getting 
<br/>clean water to everyone in this country.     Some of these challenges are legacy  ones that we will 
<br/>continue  to  address  over  time.  But  this  particular  Budget  has  given  us  a  grant  of  around  $195.2 
<br/>million to the WAF - about $8.7 million is for operating expenses which has increased by $8.7 million 
<br/>to boost the provision of water and sewerage services and we also look forward to being able to use 
<br/>this to address major issues that we have had in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  past  few  months  I  agree  that  we  have  had  some  severe  water  disruptions  in  the 
<br/>greater Suva area.  Thankfully, through those disruptions, this Budget is trying to address some of 
<br/>the issues that led to the disruptions of water in the greater Suva area.  There is about $3.9 million 
<br/>that is being provided in the Budget to try and address those issues. That money will be used to fund 
<br/>valve operations, to control the amount of pressure, where the water is going in the system and to 
<br/>also buy emergency tanks that we can put in densely populated areas to fill those tanks so we can cut 
<br/>down the amount of money that we use on water carting.  It will also be used to purchase bulk main 
<br/></span><span>repair clamps to minimise the disruption on the water flowing through the system while they carry 
<br/></span><span>out the repairs that they need to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, part of that money will be used to install pressure reducing valves to regulate pressure 
<br/>in the system along the upper Tovata system.  The upper Tovata system is an area that we have had 
<br/>the most problems so far.  This upper Tovata system includes areas like Tovata, Makoi, Naveiwakau, 
<br/>Tacirua East, Tacirua Heights, Sakoca, Savutalele, Dokanaisuva, Upper Princess Road, Cunningham 
<br/>and Tuirara.  So there are five pressure reducing valves that are earmarked for installation and we 
<br/>hope that this will have an impact on those particular areas.  We know that ultimately, a long term 
<br/>solution  will be the project  that we are developing in  Viria.  More water coming into the system 
<br/>should be able to help us address some of the major issues that we have there.  We have also had 
<br/>issues of water in the Rewa Delta, the greater Tebara area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  budget,  we  have  the  Natakiciqa  Outlet  Mains,  this  is  the  outlet  mains  in  the  Kaba 
<br/>Peninsula, there is going to be $1.1 million to extend that outlet mains to benefit around 1,250 people 
<br/>along the Nakelo to Kaba Peninsula and to improve water supply and water pressure.  There will be 
<br/>$4.5 million to upgrade and replace the existing 200 millimetre PVC water mains along Tagitagi for 
<br/>6.3 kilometres to address intermittent water supplies in Tagitagi, Qalela, Nasivi, Matacawa, Honey 
<br/></span><span>Road  and  Lubulubu  areas  benefitting  4,000  people.    There  is  $3.38  million  assigned  to  complete 
<br/></span><span>water supply projects in the Western and Northern regions – Malake Island, Khalsa Top, Vatavata 
<br/>No. 1 Road, Olosara Sewerage Road, Malomalo Village, Nalagi Primary School, Yalava, Samusamu 
<br/>Settlement, Vanuakula to Drasa Tropik Wood, Koroivolu, Matalevu, Navudi to Navai, Nasarava and 
<br/>Vunikawakawa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  as  part  of  this,  you  will  see  in  this  Revised  Budget,  we  are  bringing  back  rainwater 
<br/>harvesting.  A lot of rainwater harvesting projects have been stopped from 2019 because of various 
<br/>reasons, but now we have $1 million provided for the pending applications from 2019 and some of 
<br/>those were also put on hold by COVID-19 that has impacted us over the past two years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Viria Project which is, as the honourable Attorney-General said is the greatest investment 
<br/>that we have had in the water system in this country over time.  This first phase is going to cost us 
<br/>$270 million.  There has been a lot of issues that have addressed the speed at which it could develop 
<br/>but we are looking forward to be able to commission this in 2023 and even provide an additional 40

<div><span>857 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>megalitres or 40 million litres into the system.  Some of that water will feed into Suva, other waters 
<br/>will go into Tailevu and into Rewa areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For electricity and power, Mr. Speaker, Sir, $187 million has been used by Government to 
<br/>bring electricity to rural and peri-urban areas.  There has been a total investment of over $187 million 
<br/>to provide this electricity.  Grid extension and house wiring, there is $1.6 million in Head 50 for this, 
<br/>with 48 schemes – Central Division will have 13 schemes, Western Division will have 29 schemes 
<br/>and the Northern Division will have 6 schemes to benefit 5,000 Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The EFL subsidy for residential customers of income of less than $30,000 for the first 100 
<br/>kilowatt hours, more than 50,000 benefit on this on a monthly basis and this is not the selected few, 
<br/>these are the people who need the assistance are being provided that assistance.  The EFL subsidy 
<br/>for  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  for  those  with  a  turnover  of  $1.25  million  has  been 
<br/>extended for an additional 6 months until 31st July, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the energy sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a number of major targets, one is 100 per cent 
<br/>access  to  electricity  for  all households in  Fiji.   Secondly, to  move  entirely  from fossil fuel-based 
<br/>energy to  renewable energy in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission.  The third is to enhance 
<br/></span><span>energy efficiency.  One of the biggest challenges that we have in reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
<br/></span><span>in energy is in the transport sector.  As we know, the transport, most of it runs on fossil fuel, so the 
<br/>proposed electric shuttle bus project is therefore a very welcomed development.  We look forward to 
<br/>the trialling of system in the commercial centres with system centred around Valelevu.  I think that 
<br/>is going to be something that we are looking forward to the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  roads  have  continuously  been  a  challenge.    I  have  expressed  these 
<br/>sentiments this year in a number of places that I speak.  I speak to about the cost of floods that we 
<br/>have on the road infrastructure that we have in Fiji.  In just these two incidents that we have had so 
<br/>far this year, FRA has estimated the damage will cost around $100 million to completely rehabilitate. 
<br/>So that is a lot of money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Budget, we have a $338.2 million increase of about $65 million, 
<br/>$72.9 million will be used for essential road maintenance, $60 million will be used to expand FRA 
<br/>road renewal and rehabilitation programme, in particular the rip and remake.  If you go around Suva 
<br/>or along the Western Division, you will see roads being ripped up and remade. A lot more of our 
<br/>sealed roads have been ripped and rehabilitated and that is the programme that we will continue to 
<br/>do. There is $34 million for upgrade and replacement of bridges and $14.5 million for rural road 
<br/></span><span>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  announced  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy,  there  is  also  $5 
<br/>billion that is being provided for non-FRA roads.  As he has pointed out, there will be very strict 
<br/>criteria applied to selecting which particular roads will be used for which this money will be spent.  
<br/>In particular, there will be a focus on roads that provide access to schools, health centres, settlements, 
<br/>communities, villages and markets.  This is one-off funding because normally FRA budget is meant 
<br/>for the FRA roads.  In Fiji, we have around 11,000 kilometres  of road and FRA roads comprises 
<br/>slightly over 6,000 kilometres of that 11,000 kilometres of road in total.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The $102 million  for the Transport Infrastructure Investment Sector Programme (TIISP) to 
<br/>rehabilitate major roads along King’s and Queen’s Roads and complete designs of 40 major bridges 
<br/>and the crucial jetties that we have in Natovi, Nabouwalu and Savusavu.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  2015,  FRA  has  built  65  bridges  and  crossings.    Currently,  we  are 
<br/>building 11 bridges with another 40 bridges and three jetties in design phase. So, there is a continuous 
<br/>focus, we have around 100 critical bridges in Fiji that we are planning over time to rehabilitate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  land  related  issues  in  this  Budget,  there  is  an  increase  in  budget  of 
<br/>slightly over $2 million that will assist the Ministry of Lands addressing the renewal of </span><span>itaukei</span><span> land 
<br/>leases used by the State in areas, like Nausori.  Also part of this funding will assist in the continuing 
<br/>development of a lease administration digital platform focusing on continuing our plans to speed up 
<br/>our processes within the Ministry of Lands.  Part of it will be used to clear up the survey plans so 
<br/>that  leases  can  be  processed  as  part  of  the  approach  to  try  to  address  all  issues  that  have  been 
<br/>addressed in terms of speed developing the subdivisions and problems that people are having with 
<br/>the surveys.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  was  thinking  about  what  to  say,  there  was  one  question  that  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  of  Economy  kept  asking  during  his  Budget  Address  was,  the  question  that 
<br/>people were asking is what lies ahead?  I think what this Budget is telling us, what lies ahead that we 
<br/>have a clear path on what Government is going to do, to try to move the economy forward, to move 
<br/>the  country  forward  and  to  address  that  particular  need.    As  I  said  before,  this  Budget  has  been 
<br/></span><span>developed  by  a  Government  that  is  decisive,  the  Budget  itself  is  decisive,  it  is  timely  and  it  is  a 
<br/></span><span>focussed Revised 2021-2022 Budget. So, I fully support the Budget and the motion that is before the 
<br/>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I give the floor to the next speaker, I would 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like to announce the following speakers who are going to be next: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prof. Biman Prasad; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations and Youth and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports,; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Anare Jale;  
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Youth and Sports; and  
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Niko Nawaikula. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is in that order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  considered  the  Budget,  we  asked  a 
<br/></span><span>number of questions at the macro level.  The questions such as, “Will the Revised Budget stimulate 
<br/></span><span>or  reinvigorate  the  economy  in  crisis,  address  the  low  level  of  investment,  create  employment 
<br/>opportunities, reduce poverty and hardships, cushion the unsustainable debts, et cetera?”  It has not 
<br/>addressed all those and I think they were very clear that the Revised Budget was meant for one thing 
<br/>only, that is, to prepare for the elections, to pave the way for FijiFirst to call for the elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last night was the first time I saw the honourable Prime Minister after he 
<br/>returned from Australia.  I had actually on the day that we were told that he was under treatment in 
<br/>Australia, I asked our people to pray for him and for his family.  We are very happy to see him back.  
<br/>Last night, I saw the honourable Prime Minister as good as new and in perfect health.  When he came, 
<br/>remember there was this headline saying, “I am ready to rock and roll.”  He said that.  And last night’s 
<br/>Budget  was  confirmation  that  is  he  is  ready  to  rock  and  roll  towards  the  election.    That  is  the 
<br/>confirmation that it is an election Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>859 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of this country are a lot smarter than 
<br/>that.  Let me give an example, if they had voted for SODELPA in 2018, the $4 minimum wage rate 
<br/>would have been in place now and not wait until January 2023.  So, the people are saying, “We could 
<br/>have got  that in  SODELPA, why did  we elect  the wrong  party into Government?” And there are 
<br/>many more of that, which I will touch on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I love this comment by the honourable Usamate, “dilly-dally”.  Well, you dilly-dallied on the 
<br/>minimum wage rate for four years.  I am pleading and asking the people of this country not to make 
<br/>the same mistake because SODELPA will put in place a $5 minimum wage rate in 2023 when it 
<br/>comes into power.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is it.  Sothe people of Fiji, do not make the wrong choice 
<br/>and wait again for many years to get what you should be getting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we talk about this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to touch on the other people who need to 
<br/>be brought into the formal sector, whose employment should be formalised.  As we talk about the $5 
<br/>minimum wage rate, if SODELPA is in Government, that is what it is going to do, we will also look 
<br/>at those who are in the informal sector such as domestic duties.  They should be brought in formally, 
<br/></span><span>they should be given contracts and they should be recognised as an integral part of the labour force 
<br/></span><span>of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  tend  to  be  very  dismissive  and  casual  in  the  way  we  look  after  these  very  important 
<br/>segments of our population.  To the extent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I raised this in Parliament some years 
<br/>back, which our women are being hired for domestic duties in the neighbouring islands.  They go to 
<br/>Tonga and to other islands, these are the Fijian women, because we do not look after them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will put in place a minimum wage rate for them with proper conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  The  election  is  happening  very  soon  and  that  will  happen  once 
<br/>SODELPA comes into power, Mr. Speaker.  It can be done, if we put proper structures for our women 
<br/>to be employed in domestic duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For real, Mr. Speaker, I see this overseas where women would be contracted to clean a certain 
<br/>number of homes or a certain number of hotel rooms and it is formal and they move around to other 
<br/></span><span>contracts during the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Four families can afford to hire a domestic worker, each contributes $50 and that is $200 a 
<br/>week for a woman doing domestic duties. With the proper contracts they can even raise loans, they 
<br/>are as normal treated equally like everyone else.  This is a segment that SODELPA will look after, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.  Together with the gardeners, we can hire gardeners that could be one gardener for four 
<br/>families and the like, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- This is all part of the Revised Budget, honourable Usamate.  You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are falling short of what you have presented to the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  keep  talking  about  TELS  and  it  has  come  out  here.  As  you  know,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, with SODELPA education will be free to tertiary level.  We will not be talking about TELS 
<br/>with SODELPA, Mr. Speaker. That will be the way forward for this country, a country that is well

<div><span>educated, a country where people can execute better on the programmes we put in place,  a country 
<br/>that will be the envy of most developing countries in the world, Mr. Speaker, Fiji because we have 
<br/>the foresight and we are decisive to say that. We will educate our people to the highest level available 
<br/>to them, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade, the honourable  Minister for Education talked about  our people  being in  demand in 
<br/>New Zealand and Australia. There will be more trade training in this country. I do not know why she 
<br/>brought up technical college and then you removed it.  I am told it was something personal between 
<br/>someone and the honourable Minister for Education and someone who was at the university at that 
<br/>time, but that will come back and people will be qualified with trade and they will be in demand in 
<br/>the region.  The new global economy is largely dependent, Mr. Speaker, on labour mobility and Fiji 
<br/>will train its people so that they are in demand in the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we still hear that they have re-instated the conditions for the civil servants which 
<br/>has always been recommended by us from this side of the House for the last couple of years and it 
<br/>has eventually come into being now because again I say you know that the civil servants will not 
<br/>vote for you in 2022 unless you do this.  But you are not going far enough.  We want to give the civil 
<br/>servants’ security of employment. They fill unsecure, Mr. Speaker.  We will do away with this OMRS 
<br/></span><span>which has failed. We have a Performance Monitoring System (PMS), that was working and it will 
<br/></span><span>work.  Our career civil servants, it will be a life time calling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me touch on tourism.  Tourism is on a bounce back and has always been the 
<br/>backbone of Fiji’s industry in terms of foreign earnings and it will come back.  I spoke right from the 
<br/>beginning about pent up demand. We saw a bit of that during Christmas and New Year period and it 
<br/>is going to come back in a big way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The thing about tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that, we have the inventory and people keep 
<br/>forgetting this.  The inventory is there in terms of airline seats, hotel rooms, transportation system, 
<br/>including the boats.  So, when that happens, things will change quite dramatically and I agree with 
<br/>the forecast that has been shared with us but, Sir, tourism of the future goes hand in hand with health.  
<br/>Health has to be upgraded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A survey was conducted at the University of Queensland some time back and the respondent 
<br/>said, and I quote, “I will go to a country for my holidays where the health system is of a satisfactory 
<br/>level”.  So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  cannot  compromise  on  this,  my  colleague  honourable  Salote 
<br/>Radrodro had highlighted some of the huge challenges in our health sector, we cannot afford not to 
<br/></span><span>attend to these, it is very important.  I noticed from the honourable Minister that they have two choices 
<br/></span><span>- build a new wing at the Lautoka Hospital or build a new hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we will do Mr. Speaker, Sir, is build a new wing at Lautoka Hospital and build a new 
<br/>hospital in Nadi in the heartland of tourism.  It will be a modern hospital and I have said this many 
<br/>times in my speeches here and it will happen because if you want tourism, you need to upgrade the 
<br/>health system Mr. Speaker, Sir, and a hospital of that kind of quality has to be in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have today is the lack of confidence and I have spoken about this 
<br/>a number of times that we will need to put in place confidence-building measures and one of them is 
<br/>to have an economic summit.  I have said this over and over again, for people to sit together and look 
<br/>at  the  economy  of  the  country  in  a  collective  manner,  not  the  selective  way  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy goes around the country virtually prepping people to answer his questions in 
<br/>the ways he wants them.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to have an economic summit and I have recommended this a number of times; we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should do it.    Mr. Speaker, confidence comes when the citizenry feels safe.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Law and order is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is unfortunate that our people today 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>live in a country that is almost like a police State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I travel a lot now, I visit a lot of villages and every time … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I am the Party Leader and, Sir, I cover a lot of areas  being a Party 
<br/>leader and it is very sad when I come to a village, they whisper to me, “the Police is here”, that is 
<br/>what I get.  When I go to a village they whisper to me, “the Police is here” and these are the people 
<br/>who are not accustomed to this type of control of this nature.  These are free people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government is misusing the Police Force.  I would talk to the people 
<br/>in the room and I would feel sorry for the police officer, he is out of place and these are professional 
<br/>people and they are being asked by FijiFirst to spy on their own people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  You should see the reaction of the people when there is  a police 
<br/>officer in their midst.  Please, do not degrade our officers, they are professionals, do not ask them to 
<br/>do this for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Do not ask them to do this for you. Let them have better things to 
<br/>do, they are professionals, they are trained at the highest level of law keeping, et cetera.  Do not ask 
<br/>them  to  follow  a  politician  around.    That  is  what  they  are  doing,  they  are  following  a  politician 
<br/>around.  I do not know why they are following me around.  And it is sad, Sir, when the villagers, like 
<br/>I said, whispered to me, “the police are here”.  We will not use the Fiji Police Force in that manner, 
<br/>SODELPA will not use the Force in that manner.  Let me be very clear about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister spoke about electricity.  I went to the village of Namarai 
<br/></span><span>in Ra, beautiful place, beautiful people, on the beach.  They have had electricity there for the last 
<br/>year, poles and all the wires and all that but not connected to their homes and it is a very remote part 
<br/>of Ra.  Getting there is quite difficult, you come through Dawasamu or you come through the other 
<br/>part of Ra.  They have been saying, “Look, one year, it is here, we know the wires arrived, why is it 
<br/>not connected to our homes?”  Someone said, “Well maybe because  you voted for SODELPA in 
<br/>2018”, but  I  actually ended up apologising.  I said,  “no, it is  not  true.”  I  know my buddies in  the 
<br/>Government, they are really not that, they would not stoop to that level but please, people of Namarai, 
<br/>they have this electricity and all that, connect it please.  That is not the only place where I was told 
<br/>that maybe because they voted for SODELPA, that they are not doing what they promised to do to 
<br/>them. So, Mr. Speaker, that is my contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wish we had a bit more time to do this.  You will not have the time to talk on the Bills.  
<br/>We  are  only  commenting  now  on  the  Budget.    I  just  wish  next  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  we  are 
<br/>respectful of the people and we arrange matters in Parliament to give us sufficient time to do justice 
<br/>to something of this importance.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me just again remind our friends that confidence building is very important 
<br/>and  the  people  are  not  confident  right  now,  they  are  actually  very  fearful.    When  you  talk  about 
<br/>confidence, a happy citizenry, Mr. Speaker, creates confidence and that is where we are today.  Create 
<br/>the confidence, do what needs to be done, do not bulldoze.  It has been 15 years of that and people 
<br/>are tired of it and change is coming, Mr. Speaker, when this election happens which I believe will be 
<br/>very close.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; first and foremost, I would like to, again, welcome 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and thank him for being able to join us and we reiterate how happy 
<br/>and excited that he is here with us and looking well and for the role that is before us and also his 
<br/>decisive leadership over our nation at this difficult time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank the honourable Minister of Economy for the Budget and I can say 
<br/>that we, at the Ministry of Health, have been very fortunate that despite the challenges that we have 
<br/>had over the last two years, we have been able to be supported, given that other Ministries have had 
<br/>their budgets reduced in certain areas but to be able to do the role that is set out before us. So, certainly 
<br/>over  the  last  two  years,  our  main  focus  has  been  on  the  COVID-19  response  and  also  on  the 
<br/></span><span>vaccination campaign.  Now, that we are coming to the tail-end of that pandemic as it is, we are now 
<br/></span><span>able to reach out and to also tackle the other emerging threats whether it be communicable or non-
<br/>communicable diseases, that is upon us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I would like to commend again the Government’s move in re-
<br/>establishing overtime pay for all civil servants at Band E, and for the nurses, they have been at the 
<br/>frontline.    They  are  the  spine  and  the  skeleton  of  the  health  system.    I  heard  last  night  that  all 
<br/>throughout the country, they are very happy, not only for that but also that the maritime and rural 
<br/>allowance has been restored when this Budget will be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also the increase in meal allowances is well received and the honourable 
<br/>Minister  of  Economy  had  alluded  that  when  these  allowances  and  overtime  was  withheld  in  that 
<br/>budget speech, that all of us were indeed sacrificing, including us in this Parliament, with salary cuts 
<br/>and they were done to be able to support the nation during that difficult time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are thankful that the allowances will be brought back and it will support them and also 
<br/>the fact that appropriation has been set aside to be able to reward those who have been at the frontline 
<br/>and those who have been working 24/7 some days whilst the rest of us were contained in our own 
<br/></span><span>homes and throughout that time until now.  We have been very fortunate that recently we have been 
<br/></span><span>able to give leave to a lot of our staff and they are now coming back refreshed at the work that is 
<br/>before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  GP  Scheme  has  become  very  important.    It  is  important  because  it 
<br/>increases again the access to primary healthcare services.  We are fortunate and again I would like to 
<br/>thank  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  setting  aside 
<br/>appropriation not only to continue the scheme but also to increase the number of general practitioners 
<br/>and more importantly the work that they can do such as blood tests, tests for diabetes or tests for 
<br/>ECG, nebuliser treatment – as we know, some of our people when they front up to the nearest GP 
<br/>they  may  have  an  asthmatic  attack  and  now,  the  checks  have  been  paid  for  and  subsidised  by 
<br/>government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is something that all of us should be very happy with and that our people would be able 
<br/>to be provided to the next available health facility, whether it be a GP or health centre close to them 
<br/>and the numbers have again increased, as I have alluded to earlier.  The old school way of lining up 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>863 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at the health centre is now beginning to go out of the window.  The honourable Minister for Economy 
<br/>had said in the previous Budget Address that we are moving towards having a doctor looking after a 
<br/>person or family and that is what family medicine is all about.  By doing this, it creates a trusting 
<br/>relationship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I worked in New Zealand for three and half years, and I know all of you here have 
<br/>worked overseas,  you  would  have had a private  GP  that looked after  you and  your family.  That 
<br/>confidence that you have with your GP allows you to be able to share the most intimate and difficult 
<br/>things that needs to be sorted and that is what this programme is beginning to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  very  grateful  again  that  we  are  able  to  open  it  up  to  a  lot  more  GPs  and  also  the 
<br/>appropriation of $200,000 to look at having this available also in rural areas, such as Nawaicoba, 
<br/>Malolo, Drasa, Sabeto,  Seaqaqa, Dreketi and Nasarowaqa.  Imagine having a general practitioner 
<br/>who  is  like  your  family  doctor,  looking  after  you  in  these  places  (unprecedented)  and  again,  I 
<br/>commend the honourable Minister of Economy for his foresight in supporting this incentive and this 
<br/>will again  continue to  strengthen our resolve to  have access  everywhere so that we are definitely 
<br/>leaving no one behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Sunday,  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  March,  2022,  I  had  the  pleasure  of  spending  the  day 
<br/></span><span>predominantly with our oral health professionals around the country and I want to thank them for the 
<br/>work that they have done and during the pandemic, they were part of the frontliners. A lot of them 
<br/>were being used as swabbers – as we all know, oral health professionals know the anatomy of the 
<br/>oral cavity very well and they can be trusted.  So I thank them on behalf of the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and on behalf of the grateful nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  week  is  National  Oral  Health  week  and  it  is  being  celebrated  right  across  the  nation 
<br/>where  free  oral  health  checks  are  being  done.  It  was  pleasing  to  note  that  in  yesterday’s  Budget 
<br/>address the honourable Minister of Economy also alluded to the fact Private Dental Practitioners will 
<br/>now join the GP subsidy scheme.  This is another step forward in increasing access to all our people. 
<br/>Not only would they have dental checks but the ability to deal with acute dental issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I have begun to receive messages from dentists, oral health professionals not only in 
<br/>the public sector but also in the private sector.  In our public sector when a person comes for a dental 
<br/>check-up,  it  is  not  like  a  doctor  where  you  can  see  someone  for  10  minutes.    They  need  an 
<br/>appointment of at least 30 minutes so on occasions, they may have just forty rostered for the day 
<br/>because certainly you need machines to be up and running; you need the equipment, you might need 
<br/></span><span>to use the anaesthetise the mouth before you actually take out the tooth - so you can see that now we 
<br/></span><span>will be able to spread that and people can have dental appointments not only in the public sector but 
<br/>also in the private sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  outsourcing  of  biomedical  services  will  continue  to  support  and 
<br/>streamline operations and this a key part of the approach to ensure that the ministry works in tandem 
<br/>with the biomedical services provider. We can hold them accountable if the machines have challenges 
<br/>and also improve on the quality of care. I also note that the kidney dialysis scheme continues with 
<br/>the availability of dialysis not only in the government hospitals but also the subsidy that is set aside 
<br/>for $1.2 million and I am very thankful for this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the experts, the researchers in nephrology continue to talk about how we 
<br/>also have to address the preventative measures with kidney dialysis. The work that needs to be done 
<br/>to continue to ensure that we are protecting our kidney. So whilst these services are available in our 
<br/>three main hospitals and also, in our Nadera Kidney Dialysis Unit, and also being subsidised in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>864 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>private dialysis unit, they work around the preventative health aspects in preventing chronic renal 
<br/>failure and that is also very important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The free medicine scheme was alluded to by the honourable Minister of Economy and that 
<br/>was something that was never there until 2015 and this move has benefitted many Fijians.  In 2015, 
<br/>72  medicines  were  made  available  free  of  charge  -  since  then  we  now  have  140  medicines,  136 
<br/>comprise of medicinal products and also 4 consumables mainly wound dressings. We have more and 
<br/>more Fijians registering onto the scheme and they need to apply through the Ministry and simply 
<br/>show they qualify for any of our many social welfare schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  worked  it  so  that  if  someone  who  qualifies  for  social  welfare,  qualifies  for  this 
<br/>scheme and also potentially qualifies for the Kidney dialysis. So you can see that we are actually 
<br/>aligning those three together. The Fiji Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Services Centre will launch 
<br/>an improved implementation model for the Free Medicine Programme beginning next month. And 
<br/>under this new model, participating private pharmacies will dispense listed medications from their 
<br/>own inventory and will be reimbursed by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we wanted to do and we could not do during the COVID-19 period was 
<br/></span><span>to actually change the way that we did our systems of logistics. We are slowly able to transit it, at the 
<br/></span><span>moment they have a new supply chain software called MSUPPLY which they are now running. They 
<br/>have also changed the way they actually deliver and now they do a door-to-door logistics exercise, 
<br/>whereas before, they were dependent on third parties such as courier companies but now they actually 
<br/>do door to door. Because of the appropriation that was given in the previous Budget, they now have 
<br/>a transport and the people to be able to do this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about a project that has also been very important and 
<br/>that is the WASH project that our environmental and health officers have been working very hard 
<br/>on.  Sir, it has been estimated that, at least, 80 per cent or more of houses that were damaged during 
<br/>a cyclone would also have their WASH and sanitation damaged significantly.  We have had since 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston</span><span> 14 severe cyclones and a lot of them, because of the challenges they had with support, 
<br/>they were able to receive from Government, they were able to provide a roof over their heads and 
<br/>some of them struggled with latrines.  I know this because as I worked as a doctor and as a surgeon, 
<br/>I have operated on many people who have ruptured their intestines; ruptured it because of typhoid 
<br/>and diarrhoeal diseases.  Some of them died.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was in that operating theatre, I never saw honourable </span><span>Koko</span><span> Kuridrani, I never saw 
<br/></span><span>honourable Salote Radrodro, I never saw honourable Professor Prasad.  This is our people dying and 
<br/></span><span>it  was  very  close  to  my  heart.    That  is  why  when  the  cyclones  went  through  Fiji  and  we  did 
<br/>assessments, for three weeks we were in  Lekutu and the honourable Minister for Defence was in 
<br/>Labasa.  When we traversed through the communities in Vanua Levu, I never saw them, never met 
<br/>any of the Opposition Members who are saying that opening toilets is a waste of time – never met 
<br/>any  of  them.    When  we  had  many  houses  in  Kadavu  that  were  damaged,  and  our  facilities  were 
<br/>damaged, I never saw honourable Simione Rasova there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am trying to say is very simply our people went on the ground, they 
<br/>identified  a  problem,  there  were  typhoid  outbreaks,  diarrhoeal  outbreaks,  leptospirosis  outbreaks, 
<br/>they decided what needs to be done, we found funding for it and if you look at the budget book, there 
<br/>is nearly $1 million set aside for WASH; that is what they have done.  What are the numbers?       
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>865 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- You said Bua.  Let me make it very clear, honourable Salote 
<br/>Radrodro, that a lot of work has been done in Bua and if a typhoid outbreak broke out in Bua, you 
<br/>could be sick, your life has been protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me tell you the numbers.  The numbers indicate that with the work that they 
<br/>have done, they have been able to put in 1,286 latrines.  These are people who have struggled to put 
<br/>up latrines after the cyclones in the middle of Viti Levu, Navosa where honourable </span><span>Koko</span><span> Kuridrani 
<br/>and I come from, when there was a leptospirosis outbreak in Ra and you were making fun of our 
<br/>people walking through.  Where were you?  I was there with them.  I went to a village called Navavai.  
<br/>We hiked for more than an hour, where were you?  I never saw any of you.  So why do you make 
<br/>those comments?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me tell you one thing, if someone gets diabetes, it takes times to get diabetes, we have 
<br/>time to deal with the issues, we have time to be able to talk them and advocate.  When someone gets 
<br/>typhoid today, he can die two days later.  When someone gets leptospirosis today, he can die two or 
<br/>three  days  later.    That  is  the  difference  between  communicable  diseases  and  non-communicable 
<br/>diseases.  So once we fight this NCD, we must remember that the emerging threat of communicable 
<br/>diseases can kill people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a high mortality from it.  It can affect those who need to be able to put food on the 
<br/>table.  It can affect people who are going to work.  It can affect our people who are going to work in 
<br/>areas where visitors might come and inter-mingle with them.  That is why it is so important to deal 
<br/>with  all  the  threats  that  we  have,  not  only  non-communicable  diseases  but  also  communicable 
<br/>diseases. We need to deal with leptospirosis and nip it in the bud.  We need to deal with dengue and 
<br/>nip  it  in  the  bud.    We  need  to  deal  with  typhoid  and  nip  it  in  the  bud  and  they  have  done  it 
<br/>magnificently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To make certain comments such as that is to insult the hard work these environmental health 
<br/>officers have been doing.  Some of them have been sleeping in communities, working with them, 
<br/>supporting  them  and  they  have  worked  very,  very  hard.    So  the  next  time  you  want  to  make  a 
<br/>comment, think about the sons and daughters of Fiji who worked very hard as frontliners for COVID-
<br/>19, they will have to work very hard as frontliners for leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue, so remember 
<br/>them.  If you think that you are supporting civil servants, they are the ones who carry out the policies 
<br/>of Government, they are the ones protecting our lives and they are the ones who are putting their 
<br/>lives for our lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Opposition  have  criticised  the  Budget  but  they  have  not  done  so  in 
<br/></span><span>measured  terms.  They  have  not  provided  viable  alternatives  that  will  help  create  realistic 
<br/>opportunities to reposition the Fijian economy to operate under the new normal.  Honourable Salote 
<br/>Radrodro said, “Only fools will believe this Budget.” After yesterday’s event, the </span><span>Facebook</span><span> went 
<br/>viral with people across this nation saying how good this Budget was. And you are saying “they are 
<br/>fools”, you call the people of our country who say that this is a good Budget “fools”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  criticisms  and  judgements  cannot  change  the  fact  that  at  this  juncture  in  the  Fijian 
<br/>economy, there cannot be a smarter and more responsive Budget than this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the 
<br/>Government’s view that all Fijian families matter and no one gets  left  behind.   My Ministry will 
<br/>continue to effectively mobilise its allocated Budget and programmes to deliver an effective response 
<br/>to the pandemic, tackling other emerging threats and improve the delivery of medical services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that when Fijians unite in the face of challenges, our nation will 
<br/>emerge stronger and better than before.  Therefore, I support the Revised 2021-2022 Budget and I

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will take a break for half-an-hour for afternoon 
<br/>tea.  After that, we will continue with the debate and we will start with the honourable Prof. Biman 
<br/>Prasad.  Parliament is now adjourned.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>867 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.17 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  take  it  that  Bills  are  part  of  the 
<br/>speaking time that we have, so I may be able to say are few things on two Bills as well.  I rise to 
<br/>speak on this Bill with many different thoughts and emotions in my mind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  emotion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  anger  that  this  Government,  in  particular,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Economy treat this Parliament and the people of Fiji with such contempt.  
<br/>This Government is so arrogant that it is ready to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of the people’s 
<br/>money without letting us representatives, especially the Opposition  and the representatives of the 
<br/>people to look closely at how they are spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  why  is  that  and  what  is  the  reason?    Let  me  tell  this  Parliament  why.  
<br/>Because the Government, in my view, is actually afraid.  It is afraid that if we have a chance to look 
<br/>at this Budget properly, if there is more time, we will draw to the people’s attention the failures, the 
<br/>broken promises and the incompetence in their past performance, in particular, the incompetence of 
<br/>some of the honourable Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me tell the Government, and I think it is important for us to do that from 
<br/>the Opposition, that you are the managers of the people’s money; people in business, the poor, public 
<br/>servants, doctors, nurses, teachers and many others. They make the decision based on the things the 
<br/>Government does or the Ministers do and say.  These are things they do and say and I repeat with the 
<br/>people’s  money,  with  the  taxpayers’  money.    It  is  not  our  money,  or  the  Minister’s  money  or 
<br/>Government’s money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Ministers, I have seen, Mr. Speaker, wander throughout the country any time 
<br/>they want while people actually wait for them.  I know people have told me that they had to wait for 
<br/>Ministers to be present.  They behave as if they are very important than anyone else, that their only 
<br/>time is valuable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We saw this during the recent budget consultation, Mr. Speaker, and the example that I can 
<br/>quote is in Kulukulu, Sigatoka. When a member of a public actually asked critical questions about 
<br/>health, cost of living, minimum wage rate, he was labelled by the honourable Minister of Economy 
<br/>as talking like his friend Biman.  I do not know the man at all and the man does not know me at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if the Ministers were employees in the business, they would be fired for this 
<br/></span><span>kind of attitude, but they work for the people of Fiji.  Let me assure this Government that when the 
<br/>time comes later this year, people are going to remember that and the people who get the government 
<br/>in, who fire the government; it is the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister wants to come into this House, praise himself for two 
<br/>hours, throw around economic goodies and then rushed away.  He does not want to be here.  He does 
<br/>not want to listen to scrutiny and criticism.  He does not want to hear how things could be done better 
<br/>because he knows and a lot of the Ministers on the other side know that things are a mess.  The people 
<br/>are telling them. I know the people are telling us and they are also telling the Government that things 
<br/>are in a mess.  They need to understand that, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if you look at the budget for the last 15 years, this Government has spent $50 
<br/>billion of the taxpayers’ money. Think about it, Sir, it is $50 billion.  That is how much they have 
<br/>spent in 15 years. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I said, Mr. Speaker, in one of the sessions in this Parliament that between 2015 and 2020 
<br/>in my estimate, on average, about $500 million has been stolen from the taxpayers of this country 
<br/>through pilferage, wastage, corruption and mismanagement.  Imagine, what we would have been able 
<br/>to do with that kind of money.  It is about $3 billion in six years.  Look at the mess we are in. I mean, 
<br/>it is visible around us, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I heard the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services and Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources, again, his talking about something that they are going to do in 2023.  There is no 
<br/>water in the taps.    The roads are rutted with potholes. There are plants growing out of the main 
<br/>hospital but no drugs inside, I mean, we have talked about this. The plants are still there.  We have 
<br/>many times raised this issue in  Parliament and no one seems  to  be doing anything about  it.  The 
<br/>evidence of their incompetence is everywhere, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately.  Everyone knows, except 
<br/>they themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  not  forget,  no  matter  how  much  they  have  bragged  about  how  this  Government 
<br/>provided leadership during our worst ever health and economic crisis, hundreds of people died, jobs 
<br/>disappeared, people were forced into a sudden poverty by the impact of the pandemic. Where were 
<br/>our Government Ministers?  Where were our national leaders at one point in time, Mr. Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister of Economy thought when he went out on his so-called 
<br/>budget consultations with the people that he would receive the usual silence, if not, respect but this 
<br/>time, he heard from them loud and clear, as we are hearing ourselves.  He even brought himself to 
<br/>the point of apologising for the services of this Government.  It is of course good to apologise when 
<br/>you  are  wrong  and  when  you  have  failed  to  deliver  but,  of  course,  these  apologies  from  this 
<br/>Government are not sincere.  They are made with one eye on the people and one eye on the election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my second motion is really sadness; sadness that the people of Fiji have to 
<br/>suffer  such  a  government  and  so  much  financial  mismanagement  and,  of  course,  now  arrears  of 
<br/>taxpayers’ money as the Government tries to spray freebies in every direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The emotion, I did not expect to feel, Mr. Speaker, Sir, though was amusement.  What are the 
<br/>cornerstones of the honourable Minister’s Government’s Revised Budget?  Zero VAT on basic food 
<br/>and consumer items, increase in the minimum wage to be introduced in stages but these have been 
<br/>the National Federation Party’s policies for years.  The honourable Minister has ridiculed, many of 
<br/>them ridiculed and criticized these policies for years. Why has it taken them so long to realise or to 
<br/>see the light? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services and Lands and Mineral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resources was talking about timing … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, timing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>!  What are you talking about - timing?  You have been 
<br/>talking about unprecedented growth.  When you had unprecedented growth, that was the time to raise 
<br/>minimum wages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  also  remind  them.    The  honourable  Minister  for  Infrastructure, 
<br/>Meteorological  Services  and  Lands and Mineral  Resources bragged  about  unprecedented  growth.  
<br/>He should understand, he knows that, he is an Economic Statistician, he should understand that better, 
<br/>the  economy  had  a  negative  growth  in  2019,  that  the  poverty  rate  was  not  reduced  even  before 
<br/>COVID-19.  In fact, it went up.  So, where was this unprecedented growth that they keep harping on 
<br/>in the last so many years?  They pretend that they know what is going on. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>869 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the announcement that the 20 per cent fuel surcharge will be taken away to 
<br/>relieve the burden of cost on the people.  This is what we, the NFP, called for three months ago and 
<br/>what did the honourable Minister say, he may pretend that he does not but the public remember.  He 
<br/>puffed himself up with the so-called expertise and called the idea, let me quote, “stupendously stupid” 
<br/>and yet, it is that so called stupendously stupid idea that we are introducing now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, nothing is more amusing than watching government politicians throwing 
<br/>overboard  all  the  things  that  they  were  saying.    They  have  been  saying  things  from  2014  -  they 
<br/>opposed minimum wages, they opposed zero VAT on basic food items and yet they do not have the 
<br/>audacity or the decency or the honesty to admit that they were wrong.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I could not believe my ears, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the honourable Minister gave this House 
<br/>a  mini  lecture  on  the  policies  of  the  great  economist,  John  Maynard  Keynes,  and  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services  and  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  and  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  would  know  and  the  need  for 
<br/>deficit spending when the economy is low.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister, I 
<br/>would expect that from a C-Grade economic student at USP, who would not have read the whole 
<br/>theory or the whole part of the textbook, he only read the part that suits him.  During his life, John 
<br/></span><span>Maynard Keynes who also had to tell politicians that deficit spending was for the bad times.  It was 
<br/></span><span>not  for  all  times,  it  had  to  be  balanced  with  surpluses  in  the  good  times  and  that  is  what  this 
<br/>Government has failed to do, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It has borrowed and spent in good times and now it 
<br/>is doing the same in bad times.  It has kept borrowing and spending, that is how it has created the so-
<br/>called unprecedented growth and that is why debt to GDP will increase by almost 90 per cent or will 
<br/>be around 90 per cent in a few months’ time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the honourable Minister and those in his Government will not believe me, 
<br/>perhaps they should ask the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and they know that.  The ADB did not 
<br/>give this Government a C-Grade, Mr. Speaker, they gave them a D-Grade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  November  2021,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  ADB  downgraded  the  Fiji  economy  in  its  country 
<br/>classifications. Why?  Because it is burdened by debt and will have trouble fighting its way back.  
<br/>But what did the ADB say about Government debt, Mr. Speaker?  The ADB told us that for a debt 
<br/>management  strategy,  the  Government  actually  got  a  D-Grade,  a  fail  grade.    Why  is  that,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is because there is no strategy.  The Government’s economic strategy is very simple – look 
<br/></span><span>at the voters, borrow and spend.  This is what they did before 2018 Elections.  This is what they are 
<br/></span><span>planning to  do now and when the  election is  coming, look  at  the voters, borrow and spend some 
<br/>more.  This is why, Mr. Speaker, I have been warning this Government since 2015 that I have been 
<br/>in Parliament and this is why I think today this country is in the mess that it is in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  finished  his  speech  with  a  dramatic 
<br/>flourish.   He said  only a fool would oppose zero VAT on basic items, only  a fool would oppose 
<br/>higher minimum wages, only a fool, he said, would oppose the reduction of the extra tax.  And Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, let us be very clear; who is the fool who opposed the NFP manifesto on zero VAT?  Who 
<br/>is the fool who told us the minimum wage could not go up?  Who is the fool who refused to reduce 
<br/>the fuel surcharge only three months ago?  Mr. Speaker, there is only one set of fools in this House 
<br/>and they are on the other side and yet, they are still fool enough to believe that they are good enough 
<br/>to be re-elected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I say this to the honourable Minister of Economy and the Government – you 
<br/>have had your time.  You are so short of ideas now that you have decided now to take the NFP’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>870 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ideas instead and I am at least a little bit happy about that.  If that is the case, Sir, it is time to hand 
<br/>over the reins.  If you want NFP’s ideas, you are best to just leave them to a NFP Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is one remaining emotion I feel in this House today. Relief!  Happiness 
<br/>and relief for the people of Fiji because we all know what is coming, Mr. Speaker, even the other 
<br/>side  of  the  House,  some  of  them  know  that.    Trust  is  the  key  to  good  governance  and  fulfilling 
<br/>government’s moral  objective of care and compassion at  all times  – not only in  an  election  year.  
<br/>How can this Government be trusted to ensure continuity of zero VAT on basic food items?  Already 
<br/>people are telling me that if they win, they will put the 9 per cent VAT again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So trust, Mr. Speaker, is a very good example.  How can this Government be trusted to ensure 
<br/>continuity of zero VAT on basic food and essential items when it betrayed the people, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>after the 2014 Elections?  You look at their manifesto.  It is clearly stated.  Honourable Reddy knows 
<br/>that.  They said the Government will never put tax on those basic food items.  What they did?  After 
<br/>winning the election, it was in the 2014 Manifesto, go and look at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  2014  Manifesto,  FijiFirst  promised  to  keep  basic  food  items  and  prescription 
<br/>medication VAT free.  Yet a year later, the Government imposed VAT on them.  For six years people 
<br/></span><span>have suffered and bore the brunt of high cost of food and essential items exacerbated by VAT.   For 
<br/></span><span>two years, the Government has earned almost $115 million from 20 cents per litre extra duty on fuel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government rubbished our blueprint to reduce cost of living and raise minimum wage to 
<br/>a living wage and got their businesses cabal to slander us and warn workers of job losses.   I remember 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Economy going to the garment factories and the cabal was taking him 
<br/>around and saying, “If the minimum wage goes up progressively,  you are going to lose your job, 
<br/>factories will close.”  This is the threat, this is the fear they were invoking, Mr. Speaker, and I am 
<br/>glad today that they have seen the light of the day.  There is absolutely no basis for the argument they 
<br/>were making about the living minimum wages in 2014 and I am glad that they have seen the light of 
<br/>the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is nothing that would prevent this heartless Government and I know why they have 
<br/>done this because they are scared, they are hearing the people, the people are angry.  They do not 
<br/>believe it in their hearts and minds that they should do this, but they are responding to the anger that 
<br/>the  people  already  have.    So  there  is  nothing  that  would  prevent  this  heartless  Government  for 
<br/>reneging on these pro- people’s policies yet again, should they retain power after the Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But this time thankfully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have lost the trust of the people who will no 
<br/></span><span>longer be taken for a joy ride by this Government.  In fact, the people are sick of this Government.  
<br/>They want them out.  The people’s time is coming and I say to the Government, all of your smooth 
<br/>talks, all your freebies, all your fake lies, nothing will help you.  The people will speak and you will 
<br/>be sent into the history books. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the honourable Minister for Education, 
<br/>Heritage  and  Arts.    I  think  she  has  also  got  into  this  habit  as  this  FijiFirst  Government,  of  not 
<br/>understanding.  She is desperately trying to save her tarnished image with the education stakeholders 
<br/>and totally misrepresenting.  I mean, the gaps she made in her comments, she is trying to correct it 
<br/>out.  But let me say that when you talk about student’s choice, yes, on scholarships you can decide 
<br/>or you can have a criteria or cut-off, but if you are giving loan to the students which the students have 
<br/>to pay, then you do not tell them, “You cannot have loan in this area or loan in that area.”  That is the 
<br/>point that we are making, Sir.  So instead of trying to defend the indefensible, the honourable Minister 
<br/>needs to take a bit of a rest, think carefully, consult key stakeholders within the education sector and 
<br/>come up with some credible policies and announcements.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>871 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The habit that some of the honourable Ministers have is when they go around, they say things 
<br/>to the people without thinking because they are responding to them.    And then when we say that 
<br/>this is not right, they accuse us of politicising or taking them personally, we do not do that.  Let me 
<br/>just talk about the two Bills, in particular there are many but the two that I want to briefly talk about 
<br/>and I hope the honourable Attorney-General will clarify some of these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one is the development of informal settlements for related matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will go by your decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is about relocation of the informal settlements and it says that the 
<br/>Government which will be the leaseholder of 40 development sites to compulsory relocating formal 
<br/>tenants  whose  dwellings  obstruct  or  likely  to  obstruct  the  development  of  the  construction  of 
<br/>infrastructure and other things, and it states that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If an informal tenant refuses to relocate within the period specified by the lessee in 
<br/>writing for relocation, the informal tenant commits an offence and is liable on conviction 
<br/>to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  assuming  that  if  the  Government  is  relocating  them,  then  it  is  the  Government’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibility to put them into …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  But,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  law  has  a  catch.    What  if  the 
<br/>Government  is  not  the  development  lessee  because  this  law  does  not  say  that  it  is  only  the 
<br/>Government?  If a private developer gets a development lease, what is the provision and what would 
<br/>be the laws or regulations - we need clarification on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the second Bill, I want to mention and I have said this before, this is in relation to building 
<br/>confidence.  They  talked  about  investment  but  let  me  tell  you,  people  do  not  have  confidence  in 
<br/>investment.    In  the  ADB  report,  they  are  ignoring  that  and  it  is  very  clear  that  private  sector 
<br/></span><span>investment has been very modest. Young people with children are thinking of leaving this country 
<br/></span><span>because they do not have confidence in the health system and infrastructure. The honourable Gavoka 
<br/>talked about remittances- they do not talk about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2020, $652 million to be exact came into this country through remittances.  In 2021, $842 
<br/>million, a total of about $1.5 billion and that money, coupled with budget support, vaccine support 
<br/>and  other  support  kept  this  country  going.  This  Government  had  run  out  of  ideas  and  run  out  of 
<br/>money.  When we look at this Bill, we have made it a requirement for 20 consecutive years or an 
<br/>aggregate of 15 years before you can get a naturalised citizenship. Look at all the countries around 
<br/>the world - Australia, USA and UK – they have five years for naturalised citizenship after Permanent 
<br/>Residence (PR). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are trying to  get  people to  come to  this country, live here  and invest  here  and we  are 
<br/>putting out laws without thinking. I have said this before in this Parliament that many laws have been 
<br/>brought under Standing Order 51 (and I would say corrupt laws) that have later on found out to be 
<br/>designed for certain individuals. That is why, when laws come to the Parliament, they need time, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they need our understanding and people need to understand these laws better so that we can build the 
<br/>confidence that we are talking about. At the moment, we are not providing that confidence by doing 
<br/>this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable members of Parliament. Let me start 
<br/>by saying that the Opposition is in shock and cannot digest the assistance announced last night by 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Economy for the poor of this country. In particular honourable Prasad, 
<br/>and  not  only  that,  they  already  see  themselves  in  Opposition  come  next  election.  Because  the 
<br/>presentation  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  this  morning,  I  have  not  heard  or  seen  such  a  poor 
<br/>response to a Budget anytime in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition was just here and there.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just 
<br/>want to clarify the matter that was raised by honourable Prasad on the development of the informal 
<br/>settlements.  There are almost 40 development lease with the Government. Those leases have been 
<br/>given to the Government in consultation with the respective </span><span>mataqali </span><span>and they have been paid the 
<br/>required premium, so the developer will be the Government. There can be a private contractor to 
<br/>develop  that  subdivision  but  not  a  private  developer,  so  the  development  lease  stays  with 
<br/></span><span>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this practical and well-thought Revised Budget presented 
<br/>by the honourable Minister of Economy that provides balance to recover and grow Fiji for all Fijians.  
<br/>This is a budget that is timely and will provide the platform for Fiji to enter a new phase of economic 
<br/>recovery during the ongoing pandemic crisis.  And the war is taking further hits from the ongoing 
<br/>crisis in Ukraine.  This is not a “what if” budget, but a sustainable budget that addresses the new 
<br/>normal that we now live in, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As in our previous budgets, this is a people’s budget 
<br/>that will enable every Fijian to prosper in life with assistance from the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that this revised budget is seen and heard for what it is, to 
<br/>provide for the people of Fiji.  The Government is mandated to provide for and deliver to the people 
<br/>of Fiji.  I can already hear the critics and of course the Opposition, all ready to deliver judgement on 
<br/>this Revised Budget.  They can do all the judgements and big talk they want, at the end of the day, 
<br/>this Revised Budget delivers to and for the people of Fiji and that is what the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>does and does best.  It delivers to the people of Fiji so they can have jobs, build livelihoods and have 
<br/>a future to look forward to.  We, as the FijiFirst Government have sustained the delivery of jobs and 
<br/>a secure future for all during the most testing of period for the modern world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the first day when the first case of COVID-19 hit Fiji, the FijiFirst Government acted 
<br/>in a pro-active manner under the visionary leadership of the honourable Prime Minister to protect 
<br/>Fijian lives and well-being.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we enter the third year of the pandemic - confident 
<br/>country that has now opened its borders. Let me say that no other leader and no other government 
<br/>could have led Fiji through this pandemic; that is a fact.  This confidence is reflected in our high 
<br/>vaccination rates and the continued excellence of our frontline workers and the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and all cross-sectoral ministries in minimising the impact of the pandemic.  This is not an easy task 
<br/>nor did we, the FijiFirst Government think it was but we tackled it with confidence and faith in the 
<br/>resilience and strength of the Fijian people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  rewards  are  coming  and  will  continue  to  come  under  the  FijiFirst  Government  as 
<br/>underlined by the range of immediate measures from VAT removal to a new minimum wage for all 
<br/>Fijians.  These are practical  measures that address  the needs  of all Fijians.  This  Revised Budget 
<br/>offers hope, a path  forward with  immediate measures to  provide relief from  the effects  of  global 
<br/>issues such as the pandemic and Ukraine crisis.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>873 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the time to make empty promises or empty statements.  I am sure 
<br/>that we will have plenty of this emptiness coming in the remarks from the Opposition, after all they 
<br/>are the masters of making a lot of noise from their empty pots and as we all know, empty pots can 
<br/>only make a lot of noise but it does not offer food on the table or a job or a future to look forward to, 
<br/>to fill it up.  I can already hear the empty pots from the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the noise 
<br/>that they have already made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  timely  and  practical  budget  that  provides  immediate  relief  for  all 
<br/>Fijians.  Allow me to make some important remarks relating to the National Minimum Wage.  The 
<br/>National  Minimum  Wage  of  $2  per  hour  was  implemented  on  1st  March,  2014  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government and later reviewed and implemented in 2015 within a span of one and  half year.  The 
<br/>new wage rate of $2.32 came into force on 1st July, 2015 which also included the review of the 10 
<br/>sectoral-based minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage and the 10 sectoral-based minimum 
<br/>wage was again reviewed in 2017 through a nationwide survey with the assistance of an international 
<br/>consultant Professor Partha Gangopadhyay  and the current $2.68 per hour of work was implemented 
<br/>on 30th September, 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  continued  to  work  on  this  with  the  consultant  in  2018  and 
<br/></span><span>2019.  A nationwide survey was conducted for the formal and informal sectors in 2019.  However, 
<br/></span><span>the report was not presented in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  And I am so surprised 
<br/>that from this morning the Opposition have been saying, why now? What did we go through in 2020 
<br/>and 2021?  This National Minimum Wage is a step in the right direction to ensure that both workers 
<br/>and  the  employers’  interest  are  taken  into  consideration  to  have  a  balance  approach.  The  review 
<br/>undertaken by the consultant was to ensure that we continued to work in the best interests of all Fijian 
<br/>workers and employers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of the National Minimum Wage and the sectoral-based 
<br/>minimum wage will provide the framework and timeframe for employers and workers in ensuring 
<br/>that we have a uniformed approach on the implementation of the National Minimum Wage.  This 
<br/>will see a gradual increase from $2.68 to $3.01 to be effective from 1st April, 2022.  The second 
<br/>increase from $3.01 to $3.34 to be effective from 1st July, 2022. The third and the fourth will increase 
<br/>from $3.34 to $3.67 and from $3.67 to $4.00 to be effective from 1st October, 2020 and 1st January, 
<br/>2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in one of the consultations, I read in the media someone was saying $5, $6 
<br/>and I said in the consultation, if you even say $8, the Opposition will come by saying $8 or $9 or $10 
<br/></span><span>but we have to be realistic and we know what we are supposed to do.  Sir, this will provide a historic 
<br/></span><span>increase  in  real  wages  for  all  Fijian  workers  and  it  is  only  possible  because  we,  in  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  remain  committed  to  ensuring  a  fair  and  timely  review  and  implementation  of  the 
<br/>National Minimum Wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 10 sectoral job classification is a decade old and needs reform to reflect 
<br/>the current industry needs and the market realities, to ensure employers pay the right skills and job 
<br/>classification. For example, the wages for the manufacturing industry regulations currently has two 
<br/>job classifications that is any other worker and casual worker.  This will help to raise the productivity 
<br/>and increase new employment opportunities such as quality controllers, machine operators, et cetera.  
<br/>To  improve  industry  performance,  the  National  Minimum  Wage  review  is  useful  in  providing 
<br/>recommendation  to  replace  and  modernise  such  outdated  mechanisms  with  more  relevant  and 
<br/>practical classification to move the Fijian people and the economic forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new minimum wage rate will ensure that the minimum social protection 
<br/>is accorded to our workers in consideration of the current economic realities.  The National Minimum

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wage and the Sectoral Based Minimum Wage Review is to ensure a decent wages for all workers 
<br/>while balancing the employer’s ability to pay.  The FijiFirst Government has done this to ensure that 
<br/>no one is left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry and the consultant conducted a nationwide consultation from 
<br/>20</span><span>th</span><span> February to 5</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 Fiji-wide.  As part of the process, we received submissions from 
<br/>the  employers,  workers  and  individuals,  giving  their  views  on  the  National  Minimum  Wage  and 
<br/>Sectoral Based Minimum Wage.  I thank them all for their efforts and support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I wish to express my gross disappointment towards the Fiji Trade Union Congress 
<br/>and the political parties for their failure to attend any of the 11 consultations, nor did they provide 
<br/>any  written  submission  on  behalf  of  their  workers  whom  they  claimed  they  represent.    It  is 
<br/>unthinkable that these Union officers choose not to represent the workers who pay their wages and 
<br/>foot the bills for their fancy office, air condition, four wheel drive and international travels where 
<br/>they are always first in line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the workers of Fiji need to take these unionists to task for non-representation 
<br/>of their interest in this important forum.  They need to ask their leaders, what are they getting paid 
<br/></span><span>for,  if  they  cannot  turn  up  for  these  consultations,  and  why  they  were  unable  to  make  written 
<br/></span><span>submissions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  23  out  of    27  IRP  members,  which  equals  to  85  per  cent  attended  the 
<br/>meeting, with four FTUC members being a no-how despite been formally invited to the meeting as 
<br/>members of IRP.  Once again, raising the issues on whose interest are they representing.  Definitely, 
<br/>not that of the Fijian workers, a process that the Unions and their officials choose not to be part of 
<br/>for political reasons rather than as representatives of Fijian workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this context of the new minimum wage rate and additional budget measures, such as the 
<br/>removal of 21 items from VAT, the proposal to amend the Employment Relation Act, 2007 through 
<br/>the Revised Budget (Amendment) Bill No. 15 of 2022, will provide a balancing act, suspending the 
<br/>Family Care and Paternity Leave will lead to increasing workplace productivity.  This is a practical 
<br/>way of assisting employers to cope up with the effect of COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be 
<br/>felt over the next two years at least.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 200 per cent tax deduction for the next three years will be applied to 
<br/>those employers who will be paying maternity leave for their staff.  This will ensure that our female 
<br/></span><span>workers are given the best assistance needed during this period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I just wanted to correct the honourable Minister.  He said no 
<br/>political parties made submission.  Mr. Prem Singh, the former Member of Parliament presented NFP 
<br/>and made a submission and it was recorded as the NFP submission to that consultation.  So, get your 
<br/>facts right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I do not have to get my facts right.  What I said was, political parties, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>never said ‘NFP.’  So you should get your facts right.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Make an exception.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the generous assistance of 100,000 marketing grants 
<br/>for the next three years provided to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Council will see more job

<div><span>creation  of  the  industry  and  will  result  in  the  rise  in  export  as  well.    As  part  of  my  Ministry’s 
<br/>contribution  towards  our  economic  recovery,  and  as  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  
<br/>Economy during last night’s Budget Address, the Honourable Prime Minister visionary leadership in 
<br/>making a bold decision of ‘No Jab, No Job Policy’ at the height of the pandemic is bearing fruits now 
<br/>through our Labour Mobility Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Australian Government has resulted in an 
<br/>influx of current and new Australian approved employers now attending to Fiji for Fijian citizens for 
<br/>employment opportunities.  Sir, as of now, a total of around 4,500 Fijians are in Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand  under  the  Pacific  Labour  Scheme  and  Seasonal  Work  Programme.    This  shows  that  the 
<br/>Scheme  is  not  a  stop  gap  or  band  aid  fix,  but  it  is  a  sustainable  long  term  means  of  providing 
<br/>meaningful, highly paid  jobs  with  upskilling opportunity.  We are thankful  to our Australian and 
<br/>New Zealand neighbours for the continued expansion of these Schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this note, I thank the current participant for creating a good impression 
<br/>of the Fijian Labour force not only by been productive and model workers but by contributing to 
<br/>their  local  communities  as  witnessed  in  the  high  profile  coverage  of  Fijian  workers  providing 
<br/>voluntary services to help the flood victims in northern New South Wales in Australia.  Projections 
<br/></span><span>in Australia to well-paid and long term demand for Fijian labour and a good reputation of our workers 
<br/></span><span>will ensure that we remain big contributors of this workforce in the years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  improve  the  workplace  innovation  and  promote  productivity  in  the 
<br/>country, the National Productivity Commission will be established.  As mentioned in our 15 year 
<br/>National Productivity Master Plan, there is a genuine need of the Commission to raise the profile of 
<br/>the  productivity  movement  and  for  a  right  approach  in  addressing  all  the  factors  affecting  the 
<br/>productivity.  Sir, this Commission will set directions and advise Government on the measurement 
<br/>and improvement of productivity in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is thankful for the allocation of funds for the establishment of the productivity 
<br/>commission.    My  Ministry  is  liaising  with  the  International  Labour  Organisation  for  their  expert 
<br/>advice  and  assistance  towards  the  establishment  of  the  Commission,  to  oversee  the  productivity 
<br/>agenda in the country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the allocation of the Ministry of Youth and Sports.  It will allow us 
<br/>to continue valuable work in areas like National Youth Training Centres and through the Youth Farm 
<br/>Initiative Programme.  The Ministry of Sports continues to work with all stakeholders, in particular 
<br/></span><span>the national sporting bodies to move this sport forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are all familiar with the value of sports to our health and wellness, especially during this 
<br/>time of crisis but we must not forget the high economic value of sports.  This is an area that continue 
<br/>to grow, not only through player remittance but through increase sports sponsorship, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.    This  means  taking  a  more  corporate  approach  to  sports  where  Government  and  private 
<br/>partnerships  are  the  key  to  growing  our  sporting  bodies.    This  is  no  longer  the  age  of  sports 
<br/>organisation at the elite level relying on an ad hoc support.  We have to provide structure and have a 
<br/>business model to sustain such sporting ventures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister of Economy has highlighted that in 2021-2022 Revised Budget, 
<br/>the  Government  will  allocate  the  first  investment  of  $3  million  which  is  equal  to  25.5  per  cent 
<br/>shareholding in this year which was established by the Fiji Rugby Union to own and operate the new 
<br/>Super Rugby Franchise.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We welcome the announcement that the additional $3 million will be undertaken in December 
<br/>to secure the total 51 per cent shareholding.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that this investment will be 
<br/>money well spent as the Fijian Drua sides are already becoming household names in Australia and 
<br/>across the region.  Sir, I must compliment the Fijian Drua for the impressive performance in leading 
<br/>the Super Rugby Women Competition for inspiring the next generation of women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  this  sporting  note,  I  once  again  thank  the  honourable  Minister  of  
<br/>Economy, for the revised Budget that delivers big time for all Fijians by providing the immediate 
<br/>relief  for  their  day  to  day  life  and  delivering  a  sustainable  pathway  for  our  continued  economic 
<br/>growth for all as a nation.  I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I reiterate my support for this Revised 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to respond to 
<br/>the  debate  on  the  Revised  2021-2022  Budget.    I  will  start  with  a  story  from  the  Bible.    A  man 
<br/>approached the Lord Jesus and asked that Jesus restore his sight, I think you know the story, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  His sight was restored by the Lord Jesus and then when he went away as a happy man, he 
<br/>met the other people and they asked him, who gave your sight back?  Who restored your sight?  The 
<br/>man said, I do not know the person who restored my sight, the only thing I know is that, I was blind 
<br/></span><span>and now I can see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget Address by the honourable Minister of Economy to me is quite amusing because 
<br/>I felt that he feels and I feel too that his sight has been restored.  He was also deaf before but now he 
<br/>can hear.  The people of this nation have been crying and pleading for help.  They have been crying 
<br/>about the low wages that they have been receiving for years, they have been crying about the cost of 
<br/>living and the cost of food items in shops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But it is quite interesting, the messenger who delivered the Budget Address is a messenger of 
<br/>FijiFirst Government, him and the FijiFirst Government have been deaf and blind to the needs of the 
<br/>people of this nation, particularly the people who are living below poverty line and I am glad that he 
<br/>has seen the light now, he has admitted that he can see things properly now and can hear the people’s 
<br/>cry.    I  am  going  to  address  the  issues  in  Government  and  I  must  say  at  this  juncture,  that  the 
<br/>SODELPA will not support any move to cut the salary or wages of the civil service.  I know the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government stand is the same… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- There have been calls by some political parties for a cut in the salary and 
<br/></span><span>wages of the people in the civil service.  The SODELPA Party will not support that, the reason is 
<br/>because the civil servants in Fiji have suffered a lot and suffered for long.  The first thing is that, they 
<br/>do have security, that has been highlighted by the Party Leader of SODELPA.  The people have been 
<br/>given to sign contracts for three years, not long enough for them to be able to secure loans from banks 
<br/>to be able to invest in housing, et cetera and I think you people know about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The situation in the past was that, they have a lifetime employment and we have a system in 
<br/>Government  which  is  called  Performance  Management  System,  this  was  a  check  system  on  the 
<br/>performance of the people in the civil service.  We have yardsticks to use, they have to produce their 
<br/>work plans and what to be delivered and at what time and the role of the supervisors were to assess 
<br/>the performance on a particular, certain period of the year, either yearly or six-monthly so that they 
<br/>can ascertain the performance of that particular person.  If a person is not performing then is given a 
<br/>warning that he must pull up his or her socks.  And that is the way things should be.  If people perform 
<br/>then they should be acknowledged and rewarded.  The way the Government is doing right now, it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>877 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not giving the security of employment to people and no wonder the productivity of the Civil Service 
<br/>is in question right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I would like to raise, the politicisation of the civil service at this time.  
<br/>People in the region used to look at the civil service in Fiji as a sample - sample for this region and 
<br/>is also a sample for countries nearby.  But we have politicised appointments of civil servants in the 
<br/>Constitution of this country.  Ministers are involved in the appointment of people to the civil service.  
<br/>Why should ministers be used?  It is there, if you are not practicing it but it is in the Constitution, 
<br/>that is it.  You are politicising appointments of people in the civil service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The purchasing power of the dollar, the salaries of civil servants are very low and poor.  The 
<br/>reason is, you have not been giving them increases in salaries for long and they have suffered.  The 
<br/>purchasing  power  of  similar  number  of  dollars  to  purchase  a  basket  of  food  in  2005,  you  cannot 
<br/>purchase the same basket of food with the same dollar these days.  That is what I would like to point 
<br/>out to you.  No wonder why these people are living in poverty, the people in the civil service, I was 
<br/>quite amused when I heard about civil servants also applying to get COVID-19 assistance.  They 
<br/>could not hide the fact that they are suffering, they are facing a lot of hardships with the sort of salary 
<br/>that  you people or the FijiFirst  Government  is  paying them.  The pay  relativity that is  used is  in 
<br/></span><span>question.  You have not done job evaluation for a while.  When you talk about pay relativity, you 
<br/></span><span>compare jobs of similar nature, jobs of similar weighting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know what has happened now, the pay for certain sectors in Fiji has increased so high, 
<br/>leaving the civil servants’ pay behind.  They have not been able to catch up.  No wonder why the 
<br/>Minister for Civil Service is hinting about a job evaluation now.  You know the role of job evaluators 
<br/>- it is much bigger than the exercise of reviewing the national minimum wage, this is a big exercise.  
<br/>It will take two years to complete at least and take a lot of time to negotiate and be able to get an 
<br/>agreement on that exercise.  So, I am glad that this thing has come up.  We have to see that the wages 
<br/>of people in Civil Service are pegged to the right level.  That is the only way as I see, you are going 
<br/>to bring back productivity in the civil service otherwise it is going to be very difficult.  Thank you 
<br/>very much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had the view about zero-rated VAT on basic food items.  We have been telling you people 
<br/>about this.  You did not want to listen to us.  What has made you change now?  Why have you heard 
<br/>us now and did not hear us some years ago?  People have suffered so much.  Why have you chosen 
<br/>this time?  It is just because it is eve to Elections.  We are getting to Elections and that is the reason 
<br/>why you are doing it?  You should have done it long ago, to give these things because we have been 
<br/></span><span>telling you, now you are hearing us.  The people have suffered for too long.  You should do the right 
<br/></span><span>thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bala has been talking about minimum wage for quite a while.  He was going to 
<br/>deliver that to us but this proposal to give a national minimum wage increase and set up a minimum 
<br/>wage increase came as a surprise.  It has overtaken what he has been doing, that means we have been 
<br/>wasting time on that exercise that we have been doing.  We wasted government money and there has 
<br/>not been a result.  He has to produce that Report to Government so that we can do something about 
<br/>it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I start, I would urge the Member speaking 
<br/>before me to apologise to honourable Bala for referring him as ‘Bala’ in this august House.  He is an 
<br/>honourable  Member,  he  should  be  respected  and  he  was  actually  referred  to  as  only  ‘Bala’  by 
<br/>honourable  Anare  Jale.    He  should  apologise  to  honourable  Bala  for  disrespecting  him  in  this 
<br/>Chambers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>and honourable Members of the Parliament; before I start on my speech, I would like to clarify certain 
<br/>things  that  were  said  by  the  honourable  speaker  speaking  before  me,  it  is  not  about  the  support.  
<br/>FijiFirst Government is not reducing the pay of civil servant, in fact, we have reinstated overtime for 
<br/>civil servants on certain bands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also honourable Mr. Speaker, Sir, meal allowance has been increased from $10 to $15 for 
<br/>civil  servants.    The  Member  speaking  before  me  was  talking  about  productivity,  I  totally  do  not 
<br/>understand which productivity tool he was using to determine the productivity of civil servants.  The 
<br/>productivity and the service is increasing in the public sector under FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  civil  servants  are  also  recruited  on  Open  Merit  Recruitment  System 
<br/>(OMRS).  The honourable Ministers are not involved in the recruitment process.  A panel is set up 
<br/>and  the  panel  recommend  the  best  candidate  for  the  job  through  OMRS  policy.    He  is  totally 
<br/>misleading the Parliament.  It is this Government which has given the highest increment to the civil 
<br/>servants  with  regards  to  their  pay  in  the  history  of  Fiji.    Our  civil  service  bill  is  close  to  almost 
<br/>$1billion that stands today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in full support of 2021-2022 National Mini Budget as delivered by 
<br/></span><span>the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  of  Economy.    I  do  support  the  Budget  that  had 
<br/>exceeded all expectations, predictions and it is better for all Fijians in light of the current social and 
<br/>economic situations.  I must express my gratitude to honourable Attorney-General and Minister of 
<br/>Economy and his team for a well-thought Budget to address the needs of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while a lot has been said about how we manage the COVID-19 situation, 
<br/>here we are, out of COVID-19 situation, much stronger and united than ever before, regardless of 
<br/>every decision taken by the Government that was criticised by Opposition.  They need to appreciate 
<br/>that  we  are  one  of  the  countries  today  to  open  our  borders  to  the  world,  that  too,  with  minimum 
<br/>requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were able to do so because of the decisive decision taken by FijiFirst Government.  Let 
<br/>me tell the Opposition, whether this is an Elections Budget or not, the beneficiary at the end of the 
<br/>day are the ordinary Fijians.  We need to think about the ordinary Fijians rather than thinking about 
<br/>it in action.  We have been hearing these for the past so many years whenever we  announced the 
<br/>Budget that this is an Elections Budget from Opposition.  Come on Opposition, get over it and move 
<br/>on!  Bring something more constructive to this Chambers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Government for understanding the plea of 
<br/>parents and students who were not able to study as usual, due to COVID-19 and bringing the cut-off 
<br/>mark of TELS from 280 to 250 for certain programmes.  This will assist a lot of parents to send their 
<br/>children to tertiary institute. The FijiFirst Government used to and will continue to brighten the future 
<br/>of our children.  Also on the same note, I would like to comment to the people of North to apply for 
<br/>$100 who were affected by COVID-19. There were a lot of people affected in the North and this 
<br/>assistance will help them greatly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the support towards the Fijian Dua Team. The Team 
<br/>is already doing wonders and with this support, it is only a matter of time when we will have Fijian 
<br/>Dua as one of the most glorious teams in the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, safe and clean drinking water has been the constitutional right for every 
<br/>Fijian.  Reinstating the rain water harvest programme will assist thousands of families to collect and 
<br/>store water for household purposes.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>879 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Ministry  will  continue  to  maintain  and  improve  the  efficient  and  effective  service 
<br/>delivery under this new Budget allocation. To name a few, these will really help in concluding with 
<br/>the deliverables and at the same time recognising the value added customer service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced by the honourable Minister of Economy, the customer service 
<br/>guideline for all Government Ministries will be implemented that will certainly help in strengthening 
<br/>the customer service with respect and value to all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Employment will continue to promote voluntarism for all Fijians, including 
<br/>graduates to undertake volunteer work as part of their capacity building to prepare them for the world 
<br/>of work under the Fiji Volunteer Service Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will also be able to ensure the reduction of workplace accidents 
<br/>and continue with the overall health and safety at workplace and enforce the relevant OHS legislation. 
<br/>I strongly believe, that this is the right time for the national minimum wage rate to be increased as 
<br/>the last review was done about more than four years ago due to the challenges faced globally through 
<br/>the pandemic.  As announced in this Budget by the honourable Minister of Economy, the minimum 
<br/>wage rate will increase to $4 an hour in stages over one year period from its current level of $2.68. 
<br/></span><span>This will give time to employers, to adjust to this change coming into effect in four phases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted by the honourable Minister of Economy, we are optimistic and proud to see 
<br/>that the recovery of Fijian economy is underway. Thus, the increase in national minimum wage rate 
<br/>should not be a burden on employers and should be taken confidently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I firmly believe that the current minimum wage will assist the marginalised 
<br/>workers and meet the test of decent work. The recent research on the impact of national minimum 
<br/>wage rate suggests that its introduction did not have a substantial negative impact on the employment 
<br/>as most of the employers are already paying way above the minimum wage rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budget  provides  other  initiatives  and  assistance  to  business  such  as 
<br/>putting  the  family  care  and  paternity  leave  on  hold  which  will  give  some  relief  to  businesses.  In 
<br/>addition, the waiving of VAT on 21 essential food items with the increase in minimum wage rate is 
<br/>definitely going to increase spending by people where businesses can benefit from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reducing the VAT to zero will have huge positive impact on the cost of living.  While talking 
<br/>about tax, both employers and employees will benefit from the removal of 20 cents per litre tax on 
<br/></span><span>fuel. While the global market price of crude oil continues to increase, the removal of this tax will for 
<br/></span><span>sure have a positive impact on everyone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To further reduce the burden on Fijians, one of the assistance of $50 to social welfare recipient 
<br/>and increasing the bus fare allowance from $10 to $25 will be of great assistance.  It is interesting to 
<br/>see that even for such a Budget, the Opposition continues to oppose the Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of national productivity commission is a great move as 
<br/>well. This is expected to set up the key criteria that should drive effective and efficient policy making 
<br/>in economic, social and environmental areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in sustaining our service delivery, our Ministry will continue strengthening 
<br/>collaboration  with  our  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  our  unemployed  Fijian  citizens  find  new 
<br/>employment opportunities or become job creators through other Government initiatives with relevant 
<br/>line ministries.  The budget has been delivered in clear and concise terms.  The benefits of growing 
<br/>fiscal policies are based on innovative ideas and will directly benefit all Fijians.  This is the result of

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>teamwork and a delivery of caring and profound thinking Government led by a strong and decisive 
<br/>leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  has  given  every  opportunity  to  businesses  including  workers  to 
<br/>ensure that we promote business and at the same time maintain and create employment.  The tax 
<br/>measures announced in this budget is a bold step and only takes a strong government and a strong 
<br/>leader to put this into action for its people whom we care the most.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members,  I  thank  you  all  and 
<br/>reiterate my full support for the 2021-2022 Mini-Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Before  I  give the floor to  the  honourable Nawaikula ,  the next  batch of 
<br/>speakers,  after  that  will  be  honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar,  honourable  Inosi  Kuridrani,  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Waterways  and  Environment,  honourable  Simione  Rasova,  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Defence and National Security and honourable Mitieli Bulanauca. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.  Let me 
<br/>say at the outset that I oppose the budget along with my colleagues on this side of the House.  Allow 
<br/>me, Sir, by quoting from the speech previously made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span><span>because I feel that expresses in a very neat way the status of this budget.  He stated that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“What  is  very  clear  in  our  mind  is  that  the  Revised  Budget  presented  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Economy last night is sugar-coated to deceive the people of Fiji, 
<br/>it is an election gimmick to buy votes, give false promises and hoodwink the people of 
<br/>this nation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, later on he said this, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This 2021-2022 Budget adjustment is a desperate measure to remain in power 
<br/>by  the  FijiFirst  Government.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  not  an  adjustment,  it  is  an 
<br/>entirely new budget.  This raises many serious questions about the authenticity and 
<br/>sincerity of our budget making conventions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further down, he said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Indeed this is not genuine, it is another hoodwinking exercise.  This is a crude 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>joke on our country.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that to me says, and I am sincere and I wish to say at least at the outset, that 
<br/>the Government has lied to the nation of the need for this mini-budget or what they are now calling 
<br/>a “Revised Budget”.  The reason for my saying that it lied is because the Financial Management Act 
<br/>that authorises this kind of budget says in section 12 that it must only be done where you have what 
<br/>is called an economic shock and the effect of the economic shock cannot be accommodated through 
<br/>the annual budget process.  Only when that happens do we need a special budget or revised budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the reason why I am saying that the Government lied to us because last night we were 
<br/>waiting for the reason, we were waiting for the Government to explain to us what the shock was and 
<br/>we were anticipating that it might be as expected, that we do not have enough wants out there to carry 
<br/>us through to the end of the financial year.  But alas, that was not the case so they were lying.  In fact, 
<br/>if you look at what the honourable Minister of Economy was saying, he said that we are having this 
<br/>Revised Budget because we have managed to have a quick turnaround. We have surplus collection 
<br/>in the revenue. We have also managed, in this very short time, to have a lot of savings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>881 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he lies again and the lie is this, if you look at Page No. 22 of the Supplement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and it says:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The favourable fiscal performance relative to the budget for the first six months 
<br/>was  largely  due  to  a  $207.5  million  over-collection  in  Government  revenues  …  and 
<br/>tighter controls on public expenditures….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have said that and it goes down: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  over-collection  in  Government  revenues  was  largely  attributed  to  $185.9 
<br/>million  in  non-tax  cash  inflows  from  one-off  budget  support  grants  received  from 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand …”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So the lie is that we did not collect this by ourselves, we did not earn it by ourselves but it was the 
<br/>result of aid and donation from Australia and New Zealand for direct budget support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further down is the lie in relation to the savings in expenditure which we 
<br/>debated  last  year.  So  many  ministries  after  ministries  after  ministries  did  not  spent  their  budget 
<br/></span><span>allocation, so these were held back and we were told yesterday that this was the savings.  This resulted 
<br/></span><span>in the quick turnaround and therefore have the so-called Revised Budget. And what was the purpose 
<br/>of that?  The purpose of that was to give out election goodies for this election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my concern is that the Government has lied to the people of Fiji about the 
<br/>need for this.  They asked us and I quote the honourable Minister who said, “We will be a fool if we 
<br/>do not agree to the zero-rated VAT.  We would be a fool if we do not agree to the return of overtime.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But our answer to that was zero-rated VAT was the motion from this side of the House. All 
<br/>the time, all the time and all the time, they did not become only poor now at the eve of the election.  
<br/>They  were  poor  10  years  ago  and  honourable  Professor  Biman  Prasad  said  when  you  claim  that 
<br/>unprecedented growth that is the right time for that. So, why now? Then in relation to the return of 
<br/>overtime this was always there and our message to the voters out there is that take this but we are not 
<br/>supporting this Budget because we will remove all this and we will give you much, much more than 
<br/>that.  We will give you security of employment - six months contract, three months contract is not 
<br/>security of employment.  So those are the reasons why we are not supporting this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just go back to some of the comments that came from the other side 
<br/></span><span>of the House. Honourable Koya said that the purpose of this Budget is to bolster the economy - bolster 
<br/></span><span>the economy in what sense?  If you look at the allocation when he says “bolster the economy” in my 
<br/>mind it means that there will be injections on primary industries, but no.  If you look at agriculture, 
<br/>if you look at the Ministry of Fisheries, if you look at the Ministry of Forestry - Agriculture even has 
<br/>a negative, it is down so we cannot say that we are bolstering the economy, so do not say bolstering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  can  say  from  this  side  that  the  economy  is  already 
<br/>boosted.  They have probably had their first and second doses of boosters. If we look at the amount 
<br/>of  finance  that  we  have  allocated  or  we  have  approved  last  year  to  this  Government  to  run  its 
<br/>government business; the grants and direct budget we approved was $838 million, Aid in Kind was 
<br/>over $10 million, and the total of all that was $1.8 billion.  So, what other boosts do you want?  We 
<br/>already have enough money there to take us to the end of the financial year, so there was no need for 
<br/>this.  It was also not authorised by our laws.  The honourable Leader of the Opposition told us, in 
<br/>two years we had four budgets.  We are just doing budgets anyhow, whenever they want to - that is 
<br/>not how you manage.  That is a reflection of how bad they are managing the economy.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate stated that when we are opposing this, we are saying 
<br/>no to zero VAT and to the allowances.  That is not the point.  The point is that we will take it away 
<br/>and give you much more than you deserve.  The other point he said was that, they had nine years of 
<br/>unprecedented economic growth.  Absolute lie, because Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the figures here. If 
<br/>you look at 10 yearly performances from 1971 to 1980, and we all know that was the time of the late 
<br/>Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the growth was 4.85 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, between 1981 and 1990, that was the time of Sitiveni Rabuka, the growth was 2.46 per 
<br/>cent.  From 1991 to 2000 again that was the time of Sitiveni Rabuka, the growth was 2.44 per cent. 
<br/>Then from 2001 to 2010, the growth was 1.36 per cent.  The unprecedented growth that they often 
<br/>refer to was for the period 2011 to 2019 which was 3.24 per cent.  During the late Ratu Sir Kamisese 
<br/>Mara’s time the growth was 4.85 per cent, your time the growth was 3.24 per cent so stop the lying!  
<br/>I am here to ask them - stop the lying!  Do not lie to us, and do not lie to the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, what is unprecedented is that only one  year after that, there was a negative growth.  
<br/>There was never ever a negative growth in this country except the time that they were here in 2019, 
<br/>and  that  was  even  for  COVID-19.    We  all  remember  what  happened,  they  projected  $4  billion 
<br/>collection to be collected in revenue, and they only achieved $3 billion.  As a result during the budget 
<br/></span><span>year of that side, we were cutting off, cut, cut, cut - capital projects and operational costs.  So what 
<br/></span><span>is unprecedented here is that, during that time, the growth was negative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that he said was that, they have decisive leadership.  But if you look around, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, look at the state of their roads - that is the outcome.  We only look at the outcome.  
<br/>Look at the state of their hospitals in Fiji.  What do you see?  The hospitals even lack basic hygiene.  
<br/>Go to Nadi Hospital, on the front side and  you will  see some old beds, just piled up there;  go to 
<br/>Nausori Hospital and you will see old equipment all just packed outside; go to Levuka you will see 
<br/>basic hygiene and that is unprecedented.  That is what we look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point he stated about the Budget is that, we must look at it in context.  The context 
<br/>that  we  are  looking  at  the  Budget,  from  my  point  of  view  at  least,  is  through  the  Financial 
<br/>Management Act, and I am telling the honourable Minister that, that Act does not authorise a budget 
<br/>like this.  So, his Government is lying to us. Lying to the public that we need this so called Revised 
<br/>Budget because the law do not authorised that. The law only said it only needed when there is an 
<br/>economic shock, not as a tool to fight.an election as they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Honourable  Waqainabete  was  almost  crying  inside  the  House,  sympathising 
<br/></span><span>with the comment made by Honourable Salote Radrodro about him opening the toilets.  Let me tell 
<br/></span><span>him that the joke came from his own Ministry.  But the point we want to emphasise is that, instead 
<br/>of opening those toilets which was not given by Government any way, which was the result of aid 
<br/>and donations, that should have been delegated to his staff or the commissions in Vanua Levu.  He 
<br/>should be in his office doing policy, especially in relation to NCD or diabetes which at the time, he 
<br/>was distributing those toilets, it was announced in New Zealand that Fiji has the highest death rate 
<br/>of diabetes.  That is where he should be.  That is the point that we wish to make.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if I might just add the comment from the Honourable Bala.  He made a comment 
<br/>in relations to the law that we are about to pass.  There is a law that has been sneaked in which is 
<br/>called an Act to provide for the development of informal settlement.  This allow the lessee just by a 
<br/>notice.  If the lessee has a development lease to give notice to the occupier to vacate and if he does 
<br/>not vacate, then he will be penalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as a lawyer, I am engaged in so many cases for eviction.  Summary process we 
<br/>do that under SI69 and that Order 113.   But what  is  fundamental  is  that  the right  to  a home is  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>883 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fundamental right whether it is in a title or whether elsewhere.  And for that the court is always very, 
<br/>very careful before it gives an order to evict a person.   He will always have that as a right.  In S169 
<br/>proceedings, the tenant will produce his title but then the burden sits to the person who is sitting there 
<br/>to prove to the court that he has a right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, this law also ignores customary tenure. A customary tenure is when an individual native 
<br/>or otherwise takes the mover in accordance with customs and he is sitting there. This law is saying 
<br/>irrespective and all that just by giving a notice.  He will be evicted. It is very, very poor  and it is 
<br/>inhumane. It only tells me that this law has not been properly consulted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just give you an example, Mr. Speaker. In Khalsa Road, there are about 200 poor people 
<br/>who are currently been taken to court. These people did not just go there any how. They went to the 
<br/>landowners.  They  took  drums  of  kerosene,  they  took  </span><span>tabua</span><span>  and  now  this  law  is  limited  to  the 
<br/>Government.  I will ask them just to be given by a notice and they will be out.  So sad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, and I do not support the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for his contribution to the debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.K.  BHATNAGAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; </span><span>ni sa bula 
<br/>vinaka, namaste, assalaam alaikum </span><span>and a very good afternoon to all of you. Sir, I humbly rise to 
<br/>contribute to the debate on the 2021-2022 Revised Budget announced by the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister of Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  world as we know, has evolved much  greatly in  the past  few  years.  
<br/>Many calamities have encircled the world and Fiji was no exception.  From living through a pandemic 
<br/>to weathering severe cyclones, experiencing damaging floods and facing the effects of war.  We have 
<br/>been  through  a  lot  in  the  past  few  years  and  words  cannot  begin  to  describe  the  unprecedented 
<br/>challenges that we have faced.  However, as fear and volatility cumbered many countries around the 
<br/>world,  bold  leadership,  prompt  actions  and  principled  crowned  strategies  gave  Fijians  a  sense  of 
<br/>security and the will to fight against all odds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our leaders stepped up with great commitment in this testing times of crisis 
<br/>to ensure that Fijians are provided with every possible opportunities to live through and recover from 
<br/>the economic and social repercussions in these  times of global crisis.  The foresight, the confidence 
<br/></span><span>and the decisiveness of our leaders has not only saved Fijians lives but has also saved our economy 
<br/></span><span>from a catastrophe collapse.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  and  applaud  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  of  
<br/>Economy as well as his team, for once again devising a Budget that reflects our county’s evolving 
<br/>economic  landscape.    With  extensive  public  consultations,  collaborations  with  businesses  and 
<br/>financial institutions, the FijiFirst Government has created a practical solution to cater for our current 
<br/>economic needs with a core aim of achieving sustainability and stimulation in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this new Budget continues to prioritise what matters to our people the most, 
<br/>free  education,  free  medicine,  housing  benefits,  continuation  of  social  protection  programmes, 
<br/>provisions of more scholarships and loans for students pursuing g higher education, removal of VAT 
<br/>on basic food items and the removal of duty on fuel prices and many others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has listened to the grievances of Fijians and the 
<br/>ability of our Government to emphasise with the daily struggles of our people is evident in the 2021-

<div><span>2022 Revised Budget.  Not only that this Budget have the Fijians at heart, has it naturally addressed 
<br/>the day-to-day issues that encompass our people, without jeopardising the ability of our economy to 
<br/>recover and to grow.

<div><span>Talking about FijiFirst Government listens to people, the honourable Nawaikula said that the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Health  should  sit  in  his  office  and  make  policies  and  not  go  out  and 
<br/>commissioned  the  toilets.    The  Ministers  goes  out  to  commission  the  roads,  bridges,  toilets  and 
<br/>anything.  What do you think?  They only go to commission things… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- …as it gives them an opportunity to meet the people; to listen 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to them, hear them out.  Come on grow up!  That is all I want to say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every little win we celebrate today be it the open borders, jobs, sporting 
<br/>victories or our children being back in school is a testimony of the type of characters and prodigies 
<br/>leadership of our honourable Prime Minister.  Thank you, Prime Minister Sir.  Thank you for your 
<br/>great leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. once said and I quote, “the ultimate measure of a 
<br/>man is not where he stands in the moments of comfort, but where he stands at the times of challenges 
<br/>and controversy”, and our honourable Prime Minister together with his Government stood with and 
<br/>stood by every Fijians through this dark and difficult times.  Whether it be historic unemployment 
<br/>benefits paid to the Fijians who lost their jobs during the pandemic or implementing stringent policies 
<br/>such  as  “No  Jab,  No  Job”  to  allow  us  to  fight  and  recover  from  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Come what may our leader stood tall to protect every Fijian and work in the best interest of 
<br/>every Fijian.  Thank you, Sir.  Once again, Mr. Prime Minister, Sir, for being a true custodian on the 
<br/>wellbeing of every Fijian.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  capacity  as  Assistant  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation,  I  have  been  entrusted  with  the  responsibility  of  progressing  programmes  related  to 
<br/>persons living with disabilities in Fiji and the 2021-2022 Revised Budget is yet another reminder that 
<br/>the Fijian Government has the best interest of its most vulnerable at heart, no matter what the crisis 
<br/>is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wholeheartedly  welcome  the  increase  in  the  bus  fare  subsidy  for  our 
<br/>elderly and the disabled persons.  This increase of $15 from the current subsidy of $10 to $25 per 
<br/>month will benefit close to 40,000 Fijians and provide much-needed relief to our clientele and we, 
<br/>the Ministry, we also welcome the one-off $50 payment to our recipients and I know every recipient, 
<br/>it will bring smiles on the faces of every recipient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also thank the FijiFirst Government for programmes such as 
<br/>the Special Needs Grant Programme under the Ministry of Housing and Community Development 
<br/>to  address  the  issues  related  to  persons  with  disability.    The  Ministry  through  the  Economic 
<br/>Empowerment Programme for persons with disabilities will continue working with persons living 
<br/>with  disabilities and starting businesses on  a small scale  and work with  both  State and non-State 
<br/>parties in lifting the economic capacity of persons living with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to close with a promise that the Ministry for Women, Children 
<br/>and Poverty Alleviation is equipped to look after the welfare of those living with disabilities.  We

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will continue to reach out to Fijians living with disabilities at the community levels to the best of our 
<br/>capacity to ensure they are heard and they are helped.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, time and again we have 
<br/>overcome great ordeals together as a nation.  Our unity is our greatest strength and I urge every Fijian 
<br/>to unite with us in our efforts to build back stronger.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the stability, the prosperity 
<br/>and the wellbeing of every Fijian, I wholeheartedly support the Revised 2021-2022 National Budget.  
<br/>May God bless Fiji, May God bless us all.  </span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be also brief.  I agree with honourable Salote 
<br/>Radrodro in mentioning about the importance of remittance in this House and I would have thought 
<br/>that the Minister of Economy, in presenting the revised Budget yesterday, would have acknowledged 
<br/>and thanked the people of Fiji living in overseas for their financial support through remittance that 
<br/>kept our economy sustained during the social and economic crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According  to  the  RBF  Annual  Report  2020  and2021,  it  was  the  remittance  that  kept  the 
<br/>economy afloat and investment going and helped with circulation of funds.  It was the remittance 
<br/>that enabled most of the poor and disadvantaged families to seek medical service, to put food on the 
<br/>table, get our children to schools, meet obligations of the families and communities and importantly, 
<br/>provide hope during those times of hopelessness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remittances  have  gone  past  all  other  renowned  industries  that  normally  dominated  our 
<br/>economy such as tourism, agriculture and sugar.  The Government should provide incentives such as 
<br/>investment opportunities, reduce transaction fees, special air tickets for our people living overseas 
<br/>through our airline, the Fiji Airways for their great effort.  I, therefore, plead to this Government, 
<br/>please  give  some  acknowledgement  and  thanks  to  all  Fijians  living  overseas  for  being  a  good 
<br/>Samaritan in time of need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the revised Budget, Mr. Speaker, I consider this as a ploy considering its timing 
<br/>and the recent movement by these Ministers around the country.  It confirmed that it is a cunning 
<br/>strategy by the FijiFirst Government to bribe people for votes in the next election.  Why I said this is 
<br/>that, if you look at the Budget Strategy Framework, this Government is not fully utilising its allocated 
<br/>Budget  since  2018;  meaning  that  there  was  a  plan  already  in  place  well  before  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy announced last year that there will be a Revised Budget this year.  The plan 
<br/>was for the honourable Minister, these honourable Ministers not to fully utilised their budget and that 
<br/>the unused accumulated funds be used for their campaign budget as we are witnessing it today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this has derived the people to actually receive what was intended for them and planned 
<br/></span><span>for them in the Budget.  So, the honourable Minister of Economy has been lying all these years about 
<br/></span><span>budget allocations.  The consequences of his plan has made nurses and medical officers who were 
<br/>not paid with overtime, teachers were not paid with rural and maritime allowance, even teachers that 
<br/>look after students in boarding schools during COVID-19 were not even paid any allowance for their 
<br/>special responsibilities, the poor state of our hospitals and health centres, the lack of medical supplies 
<br/>and relevant life support equipment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it is interesting to note the standard in this Budget Summary on page 22 that due to 
<br/>the  Government  tighter  control  on  public  expenditures  resulting  in  the  $440.6  million  in 
<br/>underspending, but Mr. Speaker, Sir, this contradicts what the Auditor General’s findings that most 
<br/>of the ministries and government institutions lack internal control to assure that funds are disbursed 
<br/>to each intended purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  failure  to  comply  with  approved  accounting  systems,  poor  recording  systems,  poor 
<br/>monitoring,  lack  of  standard  procedures,  and  these  have  made  the  Auditor-General  unable  to 
<br/>determine the expenditure that was incurred in accordance with approved funding provided by the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministries.  So, here we can conclude that this is the reason why most Government Ministries and 
<br/>institutions are not submitting annual reports.  They deliberately delay the submission because they 
<br/>know it will reveal their incompetency and corruption dealings, that is why they are so desperate to 
<br/>remain in power.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All the honourable Ministers should be reported to FICAC for abuse of taxpayers money and 
<br/>failure to comply with approved standards of accounting process and procedures, that is why millions 
<br/>of dollars are being abused and ended up in corruption dealings such as the payment of $33.6million 
<br/>for  a  digger  for  18  months  of  contract  work  with  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (WAF),  unfinished 
<br/>swimming pool that has cost more than $12 million in  Lautoka (unfinished), the unfinished FNU 
<br/>complex in Labasa, where is the Nausori Hospital, where is the Sports Complex to be constructed in 
<br/>Naitasiri? Where? This is a very serious and warrants investigation by FICAC and police, it is one 
<br/>of the reasons why we are in an economic mess and social crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have a Revised Budget but a quick look through, I do not believe that it will address 
<br/>our basic problem areas such as improve our economic growth as it has declined or stagnant since 
<br/>2016, increase investment at its lowest level and remain weak, inflation will continue to rise due to 
<br/>increased imports, to improve our depleted state of infrastructure, health, roads and bridges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to make a special mention about the high liquidity which has now 
<br/>exceeded $2.4 billion.  What is the point of having this high liquidity when investors cannot access 
<br/>these funds, there is a problem with this Government.  Maybe, they are having a wrong policy mix, 
<br/>there is no confidence in the investors to borrow money and no confidence with the bank to lend 
<br/>money, so they need to review their budget policy.  I reiterate that this Budget will not address our 
<br/>priority problem areas that should bring hope and good health to the people who have been suffering 
<br/>silently over the last 15 years under this government’s dictatorship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me have a quick look at the Agriculture Budget.  It has been reduced by 
<br/>2.0  per  cent,  this  is  the  sector  I  believe  should  benefit  from  this  Revised  Budget  based  on  the 
<br/>revitalisation of our economy and food security, but it has been reduced.  Why?  The Ministry to stop 
<br/>giving basic tools such as knives, forks, spades, wheelbarrows, as what the honourable Minister has 
<br/>been doing.  Please, provide machines, diggers, bulldozers - if you want them to be commercialised 
<br/>as  you  have  promised.  You  need  to  provide  these  machines.    Where  is  the  cold-storage  that  was 
<br/>promised to the people of Sigatoka Valley to be constructed in Kavanagasau?  Where is the cold-
<br/>storage that was supposed to be constructed in Nanukuloa in Ra? Please, if you want any culture to 
<br/>survive, to improve production - look at this infrastructure.  To conclude, I strongly believe that the 
<br/></span><span>Revised Budget is a budget to legalise bribe for the sake of buying goods. It is sad and shameful that 
<br/></span><span>they have gone this far and confirmed that they are not here for the interest of the people but for their 
<br/>own interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, on that note we will now adjourn for dinner for an

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today to deliver my brief 
<br/>response in support of the Revised 2021-2022 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  for  delivering  a 
<br/>masterpiece  of  a  budget  that  balances  the  limited  resources  that  we  have  amongst  the  numerous 
<br/>competing demands at Fiji’s most difficult time.  I congratulate the honourable Minister of Economy 
<br/>for such a meticulously-crafted masterpiece budget that captured and alluded to the following key 
<br/>points that we cannot be ignorant towards: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>limited resources; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Fijian economy’s numerous competing demands; and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>we are faced with the most challenging times in our country’s history. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst these difficult times, delivering a budget that best addresses the 
<br/>concerns of all the constituents in the society is indeed a hallmark of an articulate, intelligent and 
<br/></span><span>visionary economic Minister.  The budget attempts to assist and stimulate the economy, raise wages 
<br/></span><span>of low wage earners, cushion the impact of rising cost of living of households, widen study choices 
<br/>of Year 13 students by providing increased finance for tertiary education, recognising hard working 
<br/>civil servants, protection of wages and salaries of civil servants, opportunities for house ownership 
<br/>for first  home buyers, leverage to  affected households and aged people in the Northern Division, 
<br/>medical care to Fijians who otherwise would not be able to afford it by travelling to hospitals outside 
<br/>Fiji.  These  are  some  of  the  key  deliverables  amongst  others  in  this  Revised  2021-2022  National 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, noting the above, if we were given a multiple choice question to describe 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the budget with options as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Growth industry package; 
<br/>Social package to address low paid workers and households; 
<br/>A distribution package; and 
<br/>All of the above.        
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We would clearly opt to say, it is all of the above.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I wish to  thank the honourable Minister  of Economy for his  continuous 
<br/>support to our agriculture sector.  The sector’s output has been steadily increasing over the last decade 
<br/>despite several external shocks particularly that of cyclones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, commentators and particularly Members of the Opposition 
<br/>are not able to understand the state of Fiji’s agriculture sector.  I do not know what data they are 
<br/>referring to or who does their analysis for them.  Currently as I speak, the agriculture sector is valued 
<br/>at approximately $1.5 billion.  Overall, agriculture’s contribution to GDP in 2021 stood at 8.1 per 
<br/>cent.    If  we  remove  the  sugar  sector’s  contribution  to  GDP  of  1.1  per  cent  then  the  non-sugar 
<br/>agriculture sector contributes to 7 per cent of the overall GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, numerous times in this Parliament, I had explained that it will be erroneous 
<br/>to say that five decades ago agriculture’s contribution to GDP was 21 per cent or over 20 percent and 
<br/>now it has gone down to 8 per cent and therefore agriculture is declining.  No.  Agricultural output 
<br/>is not declining.  Agricultural output has increased over time but what has happened is because of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>888 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the non-agricultural sector, some of those which were not existent at that particular point in time have 
<br/>now added on or come into  being or has  been expanding.  For example, tourism, manufacturing, 
<br/>service sector and industrial sector all these sectors now have expanded over time and naturally, the 
<br/>rate of growth of these sectors have been higher than the gradient, the slope, therefore the share of 
<br/>agriculture’s contribution in the overall GDP has declined but in agriculture the volume of output has 
<br/>not declined.  At the moment, $1.5 billion is not a small fee for a small developing country like Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey to this level of output has not been easy.  The entire Ministry 
<br/>led by the PS and myself have been on the ground talking to all stakeholders of agriculture, getting 
<br/>them to mobilise and expand production.  We have discussed with landowners to fully utilise their 
<br/>land and any unutilised land to allow it to be leased and to be put under productive use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the late 1980s and early 1990s former politicians including some on the 
<br/>Opposition, like honourable Niko Nawaikula and them, misguided and misinformed the landowners 
<br/>in saying “do not renew your leases, you can make windfall gains by using it yourself and we will 
<br/>help you and guide you.”  The poor landowners listened to them and decided not to renew a large 
<br/>number of leases. If you travel towards Wainikoro, you will see large tracts of land lying idle because 
<br/>leases were not renewed. When the leases were not renewed the landowners were looking for them, 
<br/></span><span>but they were abandoned. The landowners were looking for them for guidance on how to utilise it on 
<br/></span><span>a commercial basis but they were nowhere to be seen, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  former  politicians  have  done  gross  injustice  with  the  landowners 
<br/>because lying idle land is not providing any return or any benefit to anyone.  The landowners have 
<br/>lost a steady rental income and the members of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> have also lost income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going around, talking to the landowners to utilise the land and put it 
<br/>into productive use.  As I have said numerous times, unutilised land does not provide any returns and 
<br/>is value less, it has no value.  If it does not generate positive return then its value is zero.  For any 
<br/>resource the value is based on how much return it can generate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  talking  to  farmers  to  get  them  to  pay  full  attention  and 
<br/>commitment to the farms they have and treat it as a business.  We have been telling them that they 
<br/>must save.  Research that has been done demonstrates that unfortunately farm households in the rural 
<br/>areas do not save much and there are several reasons for it.  That is a critical issue that needs to be 
<br/>dealt  with  because  when  there  is  an  external  shock  the  first  call  is  their  own  savings  and  then 
<br/>Government comes in to support them and get them out of the shock.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important, going forward, that we work hard to ensure the rural 
<br/>households understand the importance of savings.  Also with the savings we are saying that then you 
<br/>can  get  into  investment.  One  of  the  basic  prerequisites  of  creating  surplus  in  any  business  like 
<br/>agricultural entrepreneurship or otherwise is that you must save and part of it you must invest, without 
<br/>investment there cannot be any growth so we are convincing them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also telling them not to shy away from new technologies whether it 
<br/>is a new breed of livestock, whether new varieties of crops, or whether it is new machinery.  We can 
<br/>see now that they are responding to this call, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have seen that they are coming 
<br/>forward  to  adopt  new  varieties,  high-yielding  varieties  of  crops  willing  to  renew  and  get  in  new 
<br/>breeders to change their stock herd.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These breeds are high yielding and adaptable to tropical climate.  We also talk to them about 
<br/>looking at ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency and productivity.  No country with a developed 
<br/>agriculture  sector,  has  developed  without  investing  on  increased  efficiency,  cost  and  technical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>889 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>efficiency as well as raising productivity - it is very critical. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my own research, when 
<br/>I was at USP, demonstrated declining productivity in Pacific Island’s agriculture sector – there were 
<br/>about seven to eight countries’ agricultural panel data, time series data and cross sectional data.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also talking to labourers in the rural areas to convince them to engage 
<br/>in full time agricultural activities.  We are also talking to the financial institutions, in particular, our 
<br/>own Fiji Development Bank to give the financial support to these farmers so they can tap into those 
<br/>pool of finance and make productive investment.  I have said it in this Parliament, when the national 
<br/>output  increases,  in  this  case  when  agricultural  output  increases,  then  this  surplus  created  by 
<br/>increased production will benefit all those who are engaged in this sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The beauty about the agriculture sector is that it will allow a lot of people to be engaged, 
<br/>particularly,  in  the  rural  interior  maritime,  which  is  quite  peculiar  about  agriculture  rather  than 
<br/>manufacturing which centres around the core of the urban area.  So it allows the government to fulfil 
<br/>its mandate of redistributing income.  The land owners will get increased rent; the farm households 
<br/>will get increased income; the labourers will get increased wages and the financial sector will get 
<br/>increased interest income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  doing  that,  we  also  looked  at  how  we  could  give  these  farmers 
<br/></span><span>leverage.  This year we announced nine programmes to support the farmers getting into commercial 
<br/>agriculture.  We provided 155 farmers with full irrigation kits so that we can extend their production 
<br/>into  the  drought  period.    We  provided  nursery  sets  and  hydroponic  sets  as  part  of  the  protected 
<br/>agriculture so that we can have production under protected environment; fencing materials so that 
<br/>we can migrate small farmers having 10, 20 or 30 livestock and hold medium sized farms or larger 
<br/>farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, we provided fencing materials to 633 farmers: 233 
<br/>beef cattle farmers and 400 goat and sheep farmers.  If all these farmers are successful as commercial 
<br/>farmers, our abattoir here can run five days a week.  At the moment it is running at two days a week, 
<br/>or three days a week because we do not have enough animals for slaughtering.  We need to get into 
<br/>expand our livestock sector because we have strategic advantage of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $48 million every year is spent on importing sheep meat into the country, 
<br/>while we have the strategic advantage in producing the sheep meat or its close substitute goat meat.  
<br/>We are also importing beef cattle, beef meat which we can raise in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  also  provided  land  support  to  20  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>  and  33  individual 
<br/></span><span>farmers in the settlements to bring in new land under production, bulldozers to clear the land, tractor 
<br/>to prepare the land, planting materials to expand the production into the new areas.  We have also 
<br/>provided substantial amounts of funding allocation for farmers to procure small equipment on a 30-
<br/>70 contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also started two years ago the establishment of orchards for fruits.  Hotels are using 
<br/>fruit pulp to make smoothies and they are importing.  We are saying, ‘look we need to get this hotel 
<br/>to buy local from within.’  And for that, we need to set up the ground production and supply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  got  a  dedicated  programme  to  support  women  engaged  in 
<br/>agriculture.  We are very fortunate to see that with this support, agricultural production and expansion 
<br/>at the ground level has expanded rapidly.  With that, agriculture after feeding the entire nation we 
<br/>need to get the surplus out so that we can attract foreign currently into the country.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time ever in 2020 non-sugar agriculture exports surpassed $100 
<br/>million  mark.    In  the  same  year  it  also  surpassed  sugar  exports.  In  2020  sugar  exports  was  $101 
<br/>million and non-sugar agricultural export worth $106 million.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2021 there was a 
<br/>13 per cent growth in agriculture export from $106 million to $121 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our vision is that in nine years’ time from today, we want agriculture to be 
<br/>a $2 billion industry. The surplus that we exported last year $121 million to raise to half a billion 
<br/>dollar in terms of exports. That is where we want to take agriculture to, Mr. Speaker, and for that this 
<br/>is the strategic that outline.  We need to mobilise the farmers, landowners, households, labourers, 
<br/>exporters, middlemen and the processors.  We can do it if we all get together rather than the other 
<br/>side going around saying that land is insecure; they will take away your land; do not renew the leases, 
<br/>et cetera. This mischief-making must stop.  They have done enough damage to the country following 
<br/>1987. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  for  providing  an 
<br/>additional $350,000 under the successful entrepreneurs in livestock farming which will be utilised 
<br/>immediately.  Once a budget is passed we will be advertising to provide additional support to the 
<br/>additional livestock farmers who have been left out from this earlier on of assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to take this opportunity to invite good, productive and efficient 
<br/>farmers engaged in  the sugar sector to  come  and undertake commercial farming in  the non-sugar 
<br/>agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said I want the productive, efficient, committed full time farmers who 
<br/>want to treat agriculture as a business to come forward engaging in non-sugar agriculture.  The others 
<br/>who are not very efficient - who pass time, part time, lazy farmers they can opt to pick up the support 
<br/>provided by the  honourable Minister  of Economy  to  get  the residential  lease and the land can be 
<br/>utilised by those who want to do full time  farming. We will continue to support them to give the 
<br/>initial leverage but they need to treat agriculture as a business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say and submit that we have a full grasp of the entire supply chain. 
<br/>We  have  identified  the  critical  binding  constraints  and  we  are  addressing  these  constraints 
<br/>progressively  bit  by  bit.    I  wish  to  thank  all  the  stakeholders  for  their  contribution  in  raising 
<br/>agriculture output and export, our landowners, exporters, farmers and I must say the job is not finish 
<br/>yet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  these  words  I  again  convey  my  congratulation  message  to  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister of Economy and his  team for allowing me an opportunity to address this august 
<br/>Parliament on the revised 2021-2022 National Budget.  I urge the Members from the other side to 
<br/>join us in supporting this Budget. If they do not do this they are denying support to the people on the 
<br/>ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- </span><span>Bula vinaka.</span><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to debate 
<br/>on the Budget.  The honourable Prime Minister is in good health in God’s speed, we welcome you 
<br/>back.      Honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and 
<br/>Members of Parliament.  I wish to thank the honourable Minister of Economy for his motion on the 
<br/>new Revised Budget 2021-2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to acknowledge the passing of some good friends and families of ours 
<br/>especially  the  </span><span>Tui  Rara  Levu</span><span>  of  the  Raiwaqa  Methodist  Church,  Mr.  Mataika  Koyamainavure

<br/>souls rest in forever loving and eternal peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute briefly to this Revised Budget  that was delivered by 
<br/>the  honourable  Aiyaz  Sayed-Khaiyum  at  around  9pm  last  night  and  here  we  are  since  9.30  this 
<br/>morning debating on the issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your  loyal  Opposition  does  support  the  deceptive  arrangement  in  which  we  debate  this 
<br/>revised budget as not Parliamentary friendly, not Fiji friendly or un-Fijian and it is not healthy and 
<br/>transparent, as promoted by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will seriously allude to the ineffective manner of suspending Standing Order 6, Standing 
<br/>Order 68(1) regarding time beyond 20 minutes.  Standing Order 108 which is about procedures for 
<br/>supplementary estimate, committee of supply and amendments and Standing Order 23(1) for Friday 
<br/>sittings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the suspension of these Standing Orders has taken that right for the loyal 
<br/></span><span>Opposition to thoroughly go through the revised Budget Estimate and debate efficiently and here we 
<br/></span><span>are, not even before 24 hours and we are doing great for the very limited time because SODELPA is 
<br/>Fiji’s Government in waiting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji takes a note of the increase estimated revenue of $168.1 million for the 
<br/>next four months until July 31 2022, an increase of $24.5 million in the total estimated expenditure 
<br/>which decreased the estimated net deficit by $24.5 million, decreasing the debt repayment by $20.2 
<br/>million, and decrease in gross deficit by $163.7 million</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major expenditure measures and budgetary allocations include; Tourism - $700,000 million; 
<br/>Dialysis Subsidy - $1.2 million; Free Medicine Programme - $8 million; Victims of the PCN Scam -
<br/>$2.27 million; Private Public Partnership arrangement - $13 million; FRA - $338.2 million, Capital 
<br/>Projects - $325.1 million; WAF - $195 million; EFL - $9.7 million; Survey of Agriculture Land - 
<br/>$500,000, Teachers who have been upskilled - $2.7 million</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that the honourable Minister of Economy was on the revised 
<br/>Budget Address tour since the advice on 28</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022.  However, when the time to scrutinize 
<br/>and efficiently debate on it, the effect on the suspension of the same  Standing Orders 6, 68(1), 102, 
<br/></span><span>104, 108, 23(1) and 34 does not give the loyal Opposition and the people of Fiji to publicly know the 
<br/></span><span>real intent of this budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have almost 17 Bills to debate here, Sir, in front of me, Bill No. 6 for an act to appropriate 
<br/>sum of three billion, three hundred and two million, nine hundred and fifty six thousand, one hundred 
<br/>and eighty seven dollars to ordinary services of Government for the year ending 31 July, 2022.  This 
<br/>is the kind of money that we are debating within 24 hours, it is not good for the whole people of Fiji 
<br/>and the other Bills are here, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Bill No. 8, 9 &amp; 10, there are a lot of Bills, the Tax Administration.  The Bill 
<br/>to Amend the Income Tax, Bill No. 10 - Airport Departure, Bill No. 12 – Amend the Customs Act 
<br/>1986, the Act to Amend the Financial Management Act 2001, Bill No. 15 – Amend the Employers 
<br/>Relations Act 2007, Bill No. 16 – to Amend the Citizens of Fiji Act, Bill No. 17 – the Act to Amend 
<br/>the Surveyors Act, Bill No. 18 – To Amend the Real Estate Act, Bill No. 19 of 2022 – to Amend the 
<br/>Town and Country Planning Act, Bill No. 20 – for an Act to provide the refund of monies paid for 
<br/>the  housing  units  constructed  under  the  Lagilagi  Housing  Development  Project  and  for  related 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>matters.  A Bill for an Act to amend the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act, Bill 21.  Bill No. 22, 
<br/>for an Act to provide for the Development of Informal Settlements in Fiji and Bill 23. So, I have 
<br/>briefly read through these last night and I have no idea on the legality of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The big mega question is, what about the people of Fiji out there?  Do they know what is 
<br/>happening in this Parliament because this side of your loyal House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, does not support 
<br/>anything in this manner.  It was tabled and debated and will be passed by the majority, who do not 
<br/>have the slightest knowledge or anything about these Bills.  It lacks transparency, accountability and 
<br/>is unpatriotic. There is no dignity so quite impressive and no independence quite so important as 
<br/>living within your means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  shadow  Minister  for  Fisheries,  I  wish  to  debate  the  revised  Budget 
<br/>estimate  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries.    These  has  been  an  increase  on  the  Established  Staff  and 
<br/>Government Wage Earners, Maintenance and Operations, Capital Constructions of $290,000, a total 
<br/>increase of expenditure by $393,700.  Capital construction of fish cage culture research project of 
<br/>$117,000, Pearl Oyster Research and Development Programme $108,000 and Fisheries Resources 
<br/>Conservation Programme $108,000 and an upgrade of office and quarters $390,000.  It is unfortunate 
<br/>that  the  FijiFirst  Government  is  not  really  focusing  on  our  natural  resource-based  sectors.    Since 
<br/></span><span>2018, the budget on fisheries was $21 million. In 2019, it was $18 million, in 2020, it was $15.4 
<br/></span><span>million, in 2021 - $13.1 million and this revised Budget is $13.3 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our GDP growth on fishing and aquaculture in 2014 was minus 23.3 per cent.  In 2015, it 
<br/>was minus 4.5 per cent GDP growth.  In 2016, it was minus 10. 3 per cent.  In 2017, it was a well-
<br/>to-do fishing - 6.9 per cent. In 2018 – it was minus 14.7 per cent.  In 2019 – it was minus 4.1 per cent 
<br/>growth.  In 2020, it is minus 1.4 per cent.  In 2022 this year, it is forecasted at 3.5 per cent.  The 
<br/>average GDP for those is minus 5.99 per cent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon those figures of the Ministry of Fisheries, something is wrong, something is not right 
<br/>but  everywhere  else  in  the  region  is  right.    Are  we  facilitating  sustainable  economic  growth  that 
<br/>economically empowers our people and national economy?  How is our support for our coastal fishers 
<br/>and also our fishing industry?  Has this revised Budget provided this relief by decreasing the cost 
<br/>burden to our stakeholders, so as to give them more financial breathing space?  How has Government 
<br/>renewed efforts with facilitating a landing facility for companies that are keen to keep their engine 
<br/>vessels more energy efficient and with adequate storage capacity to step in the right direction?  How 
<br/>are we with ongoing efforts to invest in technology and help with the scientific research and with 
<br/>monitoring and compliance, including reduced illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  how  is  the  aquaculture  Caboni  Multispecies  Hatchery  operating?    Is  it 
<br/>producing its consistent supply of at  least  two million  shrimp larvae to  farmers in  Fiji  within the 
<br/>financial year?  How are the hatcheries in Naduruloulou, Galoa, Ba, Dreketi and the production of 
<br/>tilapia, prawns, sandfish and grass carp and the research in the culture of high value species such as 
<br/>rabbit  fish  and  groupers?    Is  this  2021-2022  revised  Budget  and  our  collective  efforts  and 
<br/>commitment be able to do much more including meeting Fiji’s national, regional and international 
<br/>goals that will address poverty, ensure health, wellbeing, promote gender equality, achieve decent 
<br/>work  and  economic  growth,  promote  industry  innovation,  ensure  responsible  consumption  and 
<br/>production, address climate actions and more importantly, sustain lives  on land and below water?  
<br/>These are vital questions that we need to ask Government with its natural resource based sectors and 
<br/>Fiji waters having to spread over 1.2 square kilometres.  Fiji should be number one in the region on 
<br/>fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  like  to  thank  all  the  former  Fiji  residents  and  citizens  who  have 
<br/>supported our economy through their personal remittances with a growth of 14.6% which is around 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>893 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$842.2  million.      It  begs  the  questions  did  all  these  former  citizen  of  Fiji  were  ever  awarded  a 
<br/>Government scholarships: well that is for SODELPA to know and for you all to find out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, SODELPA’s call for free tertiary education is evident herein.  SODELPA will give free 
<br/>tertiary education as continuously alluded by SODELPA Party Leader, honourable Viliame Gavoka, 
<br/>because for better education for every qualified citizen, there will be no restrictions going overseas 
<br/>because the remittances are evident and will keep growing in years to come when SODELPA takes 
<br/>over Government this November 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs to seriously look into its health problems and education because 
<br/>t these are two key components of our nation building.  Once you give good health, good insurance 
<br/>and assurance to our citizens, they will be healthy to strength fully contribute to our nation building.  
<br/>Educating our nation will be e important for our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the honourable Minister for Health, thank you for visiting the Province of Kadavu since 
<br/>the opening of our boarders and also to the honourable Minister for Education for visiting Vunisea 
<br/>Government School and Richmond Methodist High School, we all trust that you will both do your 
<br/>best efforts before SODELPA takes over to form the next Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  support  motion  on  the  revised  budget  estimate  in  its  current 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deceptive elections form.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.COL.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; 
<br/>thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to  address this august House regarding the Revised 
<br/>Budget  for  the  financial  year  2021-2022  and  in  particular  the  allocation  given,  not  only  to  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Development  &amp;  Disaster  Management,  but  also  key  government  Ministries  that 
<br/>contribute and creating the environment in rural Fiji and most importantly, on Defense and National 
<br/>Security.  I know that I am limited by time, but I will try as much as I can to address some of the 
<br/>issues  and  maintain  the  focus,  particularly  on  the  intent  behind  the  Revised  2021-2022  National 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me tell the honourable Rasova and maybe all the Members of this august House  that one 
<br/>cannot deny that it is quite a challenge to live  up to this standard and the achievements of the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government under the abled leadership of the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this Government and under the leadership of the honourable Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister,  Fiji  recorded  its  strongest  period  of  economic  growth  in  the  decade  leading  up  to  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic.  And we need to continue to remind the Opposition on that, with nine years of 
<br/>consecutive economic growth from 2010 to 2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  result,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  per  capita  income  levels  rose  to  over  Fiji  $13,000  and  the 
<br/>unemployment rate fell to a 20 year low of 4.5 per cent.  Socio- economic conditions improved and 
<br/>all Fijians had better and equitable access to education, healthcare, roads, transportation, electricity, 
<br/>clean water, legal services, and digital connectivity amongst other things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to go back to the early years under the Bainimarama Government 
<br/>in 2007 and 2008 as I have stated, we cannot deny and it is unprecedented.  The development that 
<br/>has taken place in Fiji in the last 15 years or so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the events of 2007, the then Bainimarama-led Government put together 
<br/>what we call the National Council for Building a Better Fiji (NCBBF).  Most of what the FijiFirst is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>
<div><span>894 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>still continuing on today is based on the findings and the recommendations by the National Council 
<br/>for Building a Better Fiji in the areas of leadership and good governance because we needed that 
<br/>political stability and strong decisive, visionary leadership.  This is one of the areas that was covered 
<br/>under this work by the National Council for Building a Better Fiji.  As a result of that we saw the 
<br/>2013  Constitution  based  on  our  political  history,  let  us  not  forget  our  political  history  and  the 
<br/>problems that we have gone through over the years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, our problem is, we just brush it aside and we leave the cobwebs but we need 
<br/>to get rid of the spider in order to move forward and clean up the messes from yesteryears. We have 
<br/>had coups after coups but we have not taken the necessary step to address the issues, and this was 
<br/>one of the major focus of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were voting along ethnic lines and the issues are obvious, and I do not have time to go 
<br/>through it in detail.  The state of the economy as a result, again this is nothing that is plucked out of 
<br/>somewhere and say, ‘oh let us have an economic summit, let’s have an education whatever’, it has 
<br/>all been done in 2007 and 2008 by the National Council for Building a Better Fiji. Probably, we just 
<br/>need to review because we have progressed and there will be changes as well in the environment that 
<br/>we are in and most recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the state of economy back then, maybe I will relate 
<br/></span><span>this to the GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was the GDP level back then and what is the GDP today because that relates to our 
<br/>ability to borrow and finance our debts because we cannot be given finance for that matter if we have 
<br/>not increased our revenue or GDP for that matter. So the state of the economy, there was a special 
<br/>report about the state of the nation and the economy report, if I remember correctly, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Related  to  the  economy  is  the  infrastructure  because  we  need  to  create  the  environment  for 
<br/>investment.  That is why we need to modernise our infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has stated in his address today and I have stated 
<br/>this in the Parliament that the state of the infrastructure that we inherited was in a bad state, let us 
<br/>admit that fact.  Most of the infrastructure- the honourable Naiwaikula and I had a good discussion 
<br/>when we were flying across to Labasa last week because when I did some researches on development, 
<br/>post-Independence and over the years, Fiji was following closely the United Nations Economic and 
<br/>Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). That was the model that was put in place 
<br/>by  Ratu  Mara  and  all  the  developments  that  were  happening  in  Fiji  were  consistent  with  the 
<br/>UNESCAP model.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, back then, we had two guiding documents for development in 
<br/></span><span>Fiji. One is the national document that focuses on the macro level planning and the beauty about 
<br/>development  back  then,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is,  there  was  a  separate  document  that  guided  regional 
<br/>development, particularly on the primary industries and the infrastructure that were needed to support 
<br/>the environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we look at what we have today, according to the model we have Suva, then we have Nausori 
<br/>and  then  we  have  Korovou  and  then  they  had  what  they  called  the  “service  centres”  that  is, 
<br/>Dawasamu, Nayavu, Vunidawa.  In Vanua Levu we have Saqani, Tukavesi - the outposts.  They were 
<br/>supposed to be the collection centres as well according to the model that was  in place and Ratu Mara 
<br/>had placed all the infrastructure back then, but unfortunately through neglect and poor maintenance, 
<br/>as I have stated already in this House, when FRA came into being, 89 bridges had to be built.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As stated by the honourable Minister this morning, from 2015 till to-date we have constructed 
<br/>65 new bridges for Fiji, 11 are currently under construction and of course we have a few that are 
<br/>under-designed (more than 40) because we need to create the environment so that the economy can

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>895 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grow more.  Fiji still has a lot of potential but we have to create that environment.  That is why we 
<br/>need to continue to invest in our infrastructure and probably if I have time, I will go through what is 
<br/>available in this Revised Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Service Reform: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we value the work done by our civil servants but of 
<br/>course  we  are  in  a  different  era  altogether.    The  environment  back  then  is  different  from  the 
<br/>environment today but principles remain the same.  So we need some re-engineering to take place, 
<br/>we need some reforms to take place.  The structure of the Civil Service needs to be reviewed and 
<br/>importantly the organisational behaviour, terms and conditions, the branding; so many things need 
<br/>to be done for our Civil Service.  I can confidently say to the honourable Jale that there has been 
<br/>significant improvements in the Civil Service, better than what it was during his days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Including terms and conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were a lot of people leaving when I joined the Ministry of Agriculture, Sir, there was 
<br/>only one Vet Officer and he was not even a Fijian.  Why?  Because they have all left.  But look at 
<br/></span><span>the  pay  that  the  Vet  Officer  is  receiving  now  given  by  this  Government.    That  is  creating  the 
<br/></span><span>environment for them to stay because the terms and conditions are far, far better than what it was.  
<br/>While still on Civil Service Reforms, in the Ministry of Rural Development, I have talked about what 
<br/>was created back them by Ratu Mara and it is only this Government that has added more of these 
<br/>service centres into the rural areas, and I will name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Dada in Namosi, we have a Government Station there now.  In Kubulau in Bua, there is a 
<br/>Government  Station  there now.    In Namarai in  Ra, there is  a Government  Station  there now.    In 
<br/>Kavala in Kadavu, there is a Government Station there now.  In Wainikoro in Macuata, there is a 
<br/>Government Station there now.  Only by Ratu Mara and by this Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  few  more,  talking  about  the  electricity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  already  brought  the 
<br/>electricity there.  It is just the matter of the tender process so that they can be connected to the grid.Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we have already brought electricity there, it is just a matter of the tender process so that 
<br/>they can be connected to the grid that we have already brought. It is this Government, no one is not 
<br/>going  to  deny  it  that  brought  electricity  to  the  people  of  Naitasiri  who  only  used  to  see  the  wire 
<br/>running above them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We brought electricity to the interior of Namosi, we 
<br/>brought electricity to the interior of Ra, we brought electricity to Nadroga/Navosa no Government 
<br/>has ever done that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one can deny that.  I have been to 
<br/>Ovalau and Moturiki lately, I have been to Kadavu, Vanua Levu and next week I will be in the West.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I am doing my job, visiting all the projects that we have 
<br/>implemented, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They have a big issue because their lies and their words follow them.  
<br/>The  Honourable  Salote  Radrodro  talked  about  turning  promises  into  deeds.    The  deeds  are  there 
<br/>before their own eyes, they are there but their problem is the people know their lies, that is what the 
<br/>people of Kadavu told me, Mr. Speaker, Sir: Honourable Minister, keep up the good work, now we 
<br/>see what the FijiFirst Government is doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  These  politicians  come  and  they  lie  to  us.  
<br/>Unfortunately, it is catching up on them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why they hated this Budget and 
<br/>that is why they are so worried about the next Elections. For us it is about serving the people, that is 
<br/>priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Let us serve the people, Elections is another issue, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but we are called to serve the people, let us do it when we have the opportunity.  It is 
<br/></span><span>not only about decentralisation in Government services but it is about empowering them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the opening of Black Rock, we gave Nawai Police Post a 
<br/>vehicle.  After that Vatudradra Police Post another vehicle, before that we have given one to Cuvu 
<br/>Police Station, after that we left one in Kavanagasau and  one for Tukavesi, one for Raviravi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, I took three to Labasa, one to Labasa Traffic Department, one to Tukavesi, one to 
<br/>Saqani and one for the DO’s Post in Lekutu in Bua. That is decentralisation that is empowerment. So 
<br/>the public service is much, much better than where it was during the honourable Jale’s time, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and no one is going to deny that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, land issue:  I am talking about what was undertaken by the NCBBF. People 
<br/>criticised the land bank, people criticised subsidy that is given to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners so that land 
<br/>leases can be renewed. Out of that subsidy, Government has given them $80 million to date, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, topping up the 6 per cent UCV that they used to receive before.  Now the honourable 
<br/>Minister  of  Economy  is  talking  about  market  rates  that  will  benefit  our  people  because  that  land 
<br/>reform issue was addressed way back then in 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  National  Council  for  building  a  better  Fiji  because  land  was 
<br/></span><span>heavily politicised and that resulted in the decline of our economy, Vanua Levu suffered significantly 
<br/>as a result.  Therefore, this Government has to bring in the Northern Development Programme so 
<br/>that  Vanua  Levu’s  economy  can  be  salvaged  and  that  Northern  Development  Programme  is  still 
<br/>running today Mr. Speaker, Sir.  When we talk about investments, Government is also supporting 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and NDP is one of those programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week I was in Naqumu, seeing and witnessing the joy in the women on 
<br/>the  commissioning  of  projects  there  as  Government  has  signed  and  ratified  the  Convention  on 
<br/>Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).  When it comes to leadership, it is not 
<br/>only  about  giving  women  opportunities  in  places  of  leadership,  but  CEDAW  is  also  about  the 
<br/>economic empowerment of women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Four of the projects I commissioned in Vanua Levu last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were for our 
<br/>women.  It is about their economic empowerment, in Naqumu in Macuata, Bokonikai in Rabi, and 
<br/>Wainigadru  in  Tikina  Tawake.    Is  it  necessary  to  revise  the  Budget?    Definitely,  it  is  necessary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>897 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because we all know that it was a forecast, but the borders were opening up since December, revenue 
<br/>is coming in and we want to see that that revenue trickles down to every member of the community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say that again, we want to be ensure that the revenue that we have gained as a result of the 
<br/>good leadership, the decisive leadership that the honourable Usamate has talked about, is trickling 
<br/>down to the communities, and to the people, because our focus from day one is to ensure that no one 
<br/>is left behind.  We are here for all Fijians, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is why, this Budget revision is 
<br/>necessary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not about elections.  We have been told here that we are giving freebies in all direction 
<br/>according to the Leader of the National Federation Party.  But after every communities that we visit, 
<br/>we have a </span><span>talanoa</span><span>, we listen, we engage with them, we empathise with them and as a result, we come 
<br/>back through the budget consultation, we hear their cries, and that is reflected here in this Budget, 
<br/>because it is about every Fijian.  So this Budget is necessary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  importantly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  things  are  improving  and  of  course,  we  see  that  the 
<br/>Revised Budget builds upon the better and the earlier anticipated recovery in the tourism sector, but 
<br/>not only that, it addresses some of the new challenges that we are also facing, particularly, in this 
<br/></span><span>post pandemic world.  With those contribution, I strongly support the Revised 2021-2022 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I will say that I oppose the Revised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Good  question  and  I  have  to  answer  that.    Not  enough,  not 
<br/>enough.  This budget has got many names – mini budget, Revised Budget, desperate Budget, deceitful 
<br/>Budget, </span><span>rere lamu</span><span> Budget, foolish Budget, election Budget, freebies, but to me it is a vote buying 
<br/>Budget and the people are not going to buy it.  They will accept the freebies and thank you very much 
<br/>indeed, it is part of the Government of the days’ development and work to do.  They will vote for 
<br/>other parties but not the FijiFirst Government, not FijiFirst Party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why, I will explain later, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Recovery, yes there has been recovery on tourism 
<br/>and we support that after pandemic, due to COVID-19 a global scam, I keep saying that.  But we 
<br/>thank the Ministry of Health and Medical Services for what they have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have gone through the conditioning period and more will come, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They 
<br/></span><span>will announce it. They will make films about it, lockdown, vaccination  and so on. These are evil 
<br/>groups. They want to be God.  They want to form a one world government a one world order and 
<br/>world  economic  forum  such  as  Schwabs,  Gates,  Rothschild,  Soros  and  so  on.  These  are  the  evil 
<br/>groups who are initiating all this kind of things.  We must be mindful and be aware. The Holy Bible 
<br/>has already warned us about that.  Pandemic will continue to come, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we are 
<br/>thankful to the Ministry of Health for their work during the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  during  the  pandemic,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  people  panicked  particularly  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government. They forced people - no jab no job, no buy, no travel, no entering into that and so on, 
<br/>social distancing, masks, vaccinations, untested and experimental. There is no proof yet given here 
<br/>for this COVID coming from the bats to human beings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- But you got vaccinated.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Yes, I have been vaccinated on my trust, belief, I prayed for it, I 
<br/>got God given herbs which I prayed for and got healed.  I will share with you my experience, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  I brought COVID to my family, four of us.  We had already been injected with one 
<br/>dose.  We suffered from it but we survived using simple medicine - simple herbs, simple steam to 
<br/>breathe in, ventilation and so on, and we prayed and prayed to the Lord Jesus.  Now we are not sick. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I am not the Speaker.  Do not talk to me. Just talk to him and he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will instruct me to sit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, he is an Honourable Member of Parliament. People 
<br/>are listening. People actually follow what Honourable Members say in this Parliament.  Here he is 
<br/>standing in this Parliament and preaching that we should bring COVID to our own family.  This is 
<br/>not on, Sir. People are following us.  We should not be tolerating this kind of speech in Parliament, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I’m sharing my experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is a shame on him to say this kind of things in Parliament, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just sharing my experience for what they 
<br/>have asked.  I brought it to my family but we used the herbs and prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ and 
<br/>we were healed within three to four days.  We were tested and swabbed and given the okay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On another occasion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my daughter went to Lautoka. She probably got the 
<br/>virus. She brought it home and only three of us there by that time.  My daughter and my wife got it.  
<br/>My wife is a kidney patient and she is on dialysis FOR almost five years now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we made those herbs, prayed and got healed within two or three days.  Even  myself  –  I 
<br/>was amongst those two everyday talked to them, we ate together and I never got it.  There are many 
<br/>other ways of solving COVID-19, Delta, Omicron or whatever variant that we talked about but not 
<br/>to force people, not to take away the right of people to decide for themselves.  It is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government was taking the rights of individual people away.   We need to fully 
<br/>inform them, but the decision should lie on the public, on each individual.  If he dies by his decision, 
<br/></span><span>so be it.  Die in his own decision or die in God’s hands rather than die in the human beings hands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Oh, No!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- So, it is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we do not take away the 
<br/>right from any individual, do not take their freedom away.  The FijiFirst Party will take away your 
<br/>right to express, freedom to relate, freedom to whatever.  So, it is important that we focus the right 
<br/>way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, I have taken my double dose but not the booster.  Why booster?  I have double dose but 
<br/>I took it with faith.  I prayed to the Lord for any poisonous thing within this vaccine not to affect me, 
<br/>that is why I am here healthy and alive.  So, there are many other solutions, ways and means to fight 
<br/>COVID-19 or any other variant about it.  So, it is important Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I always emphasise 
<br/>for us here in Fiji is to have good health.  You strengthen your immune system to fight any kind of 
<br/>COVID-19 or any disease that might come across.  So, it is important to do the right thing rather than 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>899 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>panicking and taking the right and freedom away and force things on the people.  So, it is important 
<br/>that the next government to come, will take the freedom and rights into account.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Budget,  there  are  many  pluses  and  minus  -  Communications  +$3.6  million:  +$6.3 
<br/>million for the Military, but for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation it is -$7 million.  Why the 
<br/>-$7 million  for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation?  That  is  why  I did  not  agree with  the 
<br/>Revised Budget.  The Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation should be looked after. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is important Mr. Speaker, Sir, to re-adjust all these figures as I said it is not enough.  
<br/>Even in the Ministry of Agriculture, a reduction by $900,000, it is our main stay here, it should be 
<br/>more.    Ministry  of  Fisheries  increase  $400,000  -  should  be  more,  Ministry  of  Forestry  increase 
<br/>$600,000 - should be more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Ministry of Forestry, the native timber production is going down and 
<br/>also the mahogany production is going down.  The export crops from $38 million to only $6 million 
<br/>now only $10 million or $12 million.  We have to focus and improve our primary industries and get 
<br/>more out of it. Plus $11 million to Sugar Corporation and I hope they will be profitable and produce 
<br/>more with that funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Roads Authority increase $66 million to us that is less, should be given $100 million, 
<br/>more to FRA to open up new areas to plant more cane and everything else and open up in Vitilevu 
<br/>and Vanualevu.  So, it is important to properly fund FRA to open areas for all those kinds of things.  
<br/>That is why I oppose it because that is not enough and we need more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What honourable Seruiratu is saying is right.  That is part of government’s job to do but it is 
<br/>not enough.  You see, you need more so it is important that we also give incentives like we give to 
<br/>the tourism.  We also give incentive to agriculture, forestry, fisheries and also the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources particularly on taxation or duties or some financial incentives for them to 
<br/>survive and produce more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment the suspension of logging licences in the North in February just last month 
<br/>and the mills in the North are all at a standstill because there is no log supply to them.  Why the 
<br/>suspension of logging licences because they did not meet the EIA requirements?  We should not be 
<br/>using EIA as a stumbling block to production but we should be using environmental for development 
<br/>purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should give them time to comply and also help them to comply.  As long 
<br/></span><span>as  we  keep  getting  the  supply  of  logs  to  the  mills  and  get  the  production  going  and  solve  those 
<br/>problems of EIA for the time being.  At the moment, all the Labasa mills are out of stock, on standstill 
<br/>or struggling to get minimum supply of logs because of that overall suspension of logging licences, 
<br/>so  it  is  important  to  make  the  right  decision,  continue  the  supply,  the  manufacturing  and  the 
<br/>production are going and solve those kind of things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Minister  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources,  only  plus  $100,000  more  but  you  need  to 
<br/>encourage survey of leases for registration and also with  agriculture and TLTB, identify idle lands 
<br/>and make them productive.  Although what had happened last time for non-renewal of leases, had 
<br/>happened, we cannot go back, you have to look at today and go to tomorrow.  We know where the 
<br/>idle lands are, encourage them to produce, so it is now, do not look back, do not think back, just look 
<br/>at today, what we can do and go on forward tomorrow. So, it is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to also 
<br/>open up more new lands for cane, agriculture and et cetera.  This is where FRA should have increased 
<br/>up to $100 million as it is important to open up new areas.  There are lands there available which can

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be used for cane, can be used for other agricultural products, et cetera.  It is important, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistances  to  landowners,  it  is  important  to  promote  subsistence  level  of  farming  to 
<br/>commercial  and  we  must  provide  incentives  for  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries  as  I  have  already 
<br/>mentioned.    Also  manufacturing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  and  assist  provincial  businesses,  family  and 
<br/>partnership  businesses,  individual  business  with  financial  incentives,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  so  it  is 
<br/>important to look at those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister in his speech said that the decision was right for mandating 
<br/>of vaccines. No, it is not right because you are forcing people. Democracy – you should not force. 
<br/>Leave  the  decision  to  the  public  or  the  individual.    You  just  fully  inform  them  because  all  these 
<br/>vaccines are untested and experimental as I have already said and I can prove to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB and </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land ownership is intact too in the 2013 Constitution. 
<br/>Fine, accepted! But the Bills come through here at night and passed in the day by a mere 51 per cent.  
<br/>You  are  depriving  the  right  of  that  owner.    You  are  reducing  mitigation  and  the  right  of  that 
<br/>ownership.  You are taking away his right – right for prior consultation on land. So, it is important, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir. But those Bills, they come into here, passed through only 51 per cent in this House, 
<br/></span><span>it affects the right of that owner and that owner will sit there toothless.  I can explain more to that but 
<br/>leave it at that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  after election this  year, also  I  cannot  see the USP  grants  here, probably 
<br/>under Head 50.  After the election when we come in, the first payment, we will pay USP.  Get your 
<br/>grant, get the education going for USP students and enjoy your education.  That is confirmed, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I thank the Minister for the Nakasi Market, the sooner the better.  Also, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister mentioned about bold leadership. It is not bold enough for me.  When we come into 
<br/>government this year, we will be having bolder, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will revolutionise agriculture, 
<br/>revolutionise  forestry,  revolutionise  fisheries,  revolutionise  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral 
<br/>Resources, manufacturing and civil servants to be localised and create opportunities, educate them, 
<br/>train them, encourage them and trust them, rather than just sacking them willingly.  Give them justice, 
<br/>give them opportunity.  That is my contribution regarding the Revised Budget, as I said, I oppose 
<br/>because it can be better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I know that we are 30 minutes away from the rugby match which 
<br/></span><span>will have the Fijian Drua and the Rebels, I was reminded by the gentlemen in the House, Tanya, just 
<br/>keep it short, so I will just get straight to the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the outset, I do not support this Revised Budget and I agree that Fiji is not immune to 
<br/>the COVID global challenges and we can all agree that the Government had to make drastic economic 
<br/>&amp; financial decision but when times are tough, a good government is transparent, keeps everyone 
<br/>well informed of their decision and importantly, state the facts with accuracy and truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all know the saying “desperate times brings desperate measures” and this is 
<br/>what this budget is all about, we are four months away to the end of the financial year and let us call 
<br/>it what it is; it is the election year and we now have zero VAT basic food items that should have been 
<br/>announced earlier in the financial year.  That is when our people need it the most.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>901 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Well, you do not get it, they do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What guarantee is there for our people that these zero rate items, concessions, discounts and 
<br/>so forth will not be increased again or removed or unfulfilled in the next financial year, mind you, 
<br/>we have yet to debate and pass the Budget for the next financial year and I believe it is only three 
<br/>months away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know too well the many promises that this Government made in their annual Budget 
<br/>announcement and whilst they fulfil some and many have not, this Revised Budget is no different.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard honourable Aseri Radrodro stated earlier, ‘the devil is always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the detail’. I read through the Supplement Booklet, chapter 3, page 22, paragraph 3.4, “I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “The favourable fiscal performance relative to the budget for the first six months 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was largely due to a $207.5m over collection in Government Revenue.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  layman’s  term  because  I  am  not  a  finance  person,  the  Government  says  that  from 
<br/>September  2021  and  February  2022,  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  when  businesses  were  still 
<br/></span><span>struggling  (mine  included)    and  many  are  still  recovering,  their  so  called  “favourable  fiscal 
<br/></span><span>performance” they over collected on their Government revenue during the six month period. When 
<br/>we read para 3.5 of the same page, it reads:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The over collection in Government revenue was largely attributed to $185.9m in non-
<br/>tax cash inflows from one off budget support grants received from Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand in December 2021.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is where the money came from because the over collection in government revenue, a big 
<br/>chunk of it came from donors.  Let us call a spade a spade, this Government so called favourable 
<br/>fiscal  performance  was  largely  attributed  from  the  budget  support  from  the  Australia  and  New 
<br/>Zealand Governments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  speak  on  Tertiary  Educational  Loan  Scheme  (TELS).    Now,  I  commend  the 
<br/>Government in reducing the TELS entry mark to 250 in this Revised Budget, however, we still have 
<br/>an oversupply of graduates who are unemployed.  I know this because, I see a lot of young  legal 
<br/>professionals who graduated two or three years ago, are still looking for jobs.  Job creation, with all 
<br/>due respect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is lacking in this Budget.  This Government announced at the 
<br/></span><span>beginning of this financial year that they will not make its annual grant to USP of $61.3 million as 
<br/></span><span>long as Professor Ahluwalia remains the USP-Vice Chancellor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No , no.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- The honorable Minister of Economy said that the Fiji Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had a number of governance issues with USP.  In the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> article of Wednesday, 16</span><span>th</span><span> March, 
<br/>2022, the honourable Minister of Economy responded to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a point of order  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.A.SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is misleading the 
<br/>Parliament. We never said that the grant will not be given until Pal Ahluwalia leaves. We said that 
<br/>we wanted an investigation in the allegation that was made by the independent body and only then, 
<br/>we will do it. She is completely misleading, in fact she is lying. She should stop.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  I  will    continue,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    In  the  </span><span>Fiji  Sun</span><span>  article  of 
<br/>Wednesday, 16</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022, the honorable Minister of Economy responded to the regional Vice 
<br/>President of University of the South Pacific Student Association (USPSA) and said, “I am sure you 
<br/>will acknowledge that none of your students have not had their fees paid. If they are under TELS or 
<br/>Toppers, they still get the money. Over a $100 million have been paid to USP so you are not affected 
<br/>by  that”.  Now,  this  is  common  sense  that  without  this  annual  grant,  USP’s  services  to  the  TELS 
<br/>students  and  the  other  Fijian  students  at  USP  will  be  compromised.  Budget  cuts  should  be 
<br/>anticipated– cuts in teaching staff, cuts in admin support, cuts that will ultimately affect our own 
<br/>youths that attend USP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister’s response is immature and irresponsible. USP is a regional 
<br/>organization which breeds our Fiji and Pacific leaders of today and tomorrow. And this Government 
<br/>TELS and Toppers contribution alone on a yearly basis is not sufficient to cover for the services that 
<br/>USP provides to all our Fijian students in Fiji and throughout the region. So, if anyone is affected by 
<br/>the shortfall of any of USP’s services, it is our own people, our student youths, including those on 
<br/>TELS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have said this in my Budget response last year and I will say it again, you cannot give what 
<br/></span><span>you do not have. This Government withheld the grant because there was never any money to give in 
<br/></span><span>the first place. The budget support is the case input. Now to our youths of Fiji from the ages of 18– 
<br/>30years old, do not be hoodwinked by this Revised Budget. Whatever this Government has given to 
<br/>you in freebies, that money was from the overseas donors.  Do not make the same mistake in 2018, 
<br/>where a total of 176,967 youths within this age bracket has registered to vote but only 107, 585 went 
<br/>to vote. A total of 69,382 did not vote. And this is the Government that is withholding the USP grant 
<br/>that acted to educate our future. That is the priority of this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had mentioned earlier that the Minister of Economy had said that the Fiji Government had 
<br/>governance issues with USP and then the honorable Minister said do not lie. When I hear the word 
<br/>governance, I link it to accountability, transparency, and more importantly, integrity. The definition, 
<br/>the understanding and the application of “good governance” is certainly different from what we know 
<br/>from this side of the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the Minister of Economy forgets what he did back in November, 2014 in the Suvavoa 
<br/>House in his boardroom. I would refresh his memory, in my presence and the two other former Fijian 
<br/>holding  board  members,  the  former  Solicitor-General  and  the  other  two  Fiji  TV  Executives.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Economy, vote out a press release and told us that we are to sign this press release and 
<br/></span><span>you will agree to share IRB 7s to FBC. So if anyone here is a liar, he is a liar. When you talk about 
<br/></span><span>integrity, make sure your own house is clean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- How does it prove that I am a liar. What did I lie about in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that context? Where is the lie? There is no lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I will continue, Mr. Speaker,  from that day till now he has never 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>denied.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Retract.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am addressing you and I will continue .. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Where is the lie?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>903 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did not sign the press release nor did we did 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compromise our integrity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHIAYUM.- Move along.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- When we talk about governance, when we talk about lies we make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sure that our own backyards are clean.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is shocking that a public listed company that a Minister could interfere at 
<br/>that level because in any true democratic country he would have been fired back in 2014.  Please do 
<br/>not use loosely the words “good governance”.  Those are some key points, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I 
<br/>will speak on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to see that over time we will re-instated especially for civil servants on Bands E 
<br/>and below.  I only wish that this overtime could be back-dated.  I pray that the civil servants that 
<br/>worked hard during the COVID pandemic period do not forget this because we are only four months 
<br/>away, this Revised Budget is only four months away till the end of the financial year.  I am sure there 
<br/>will not be any overtime for those in Band E or Band F and below.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing about the unprecedented growth.  From Wednesday, Thursday, 
<br/>Friday and till about 10 minutes ago, my kids have told me, “mum, we still have no water at home.”  
<br/>Let us start first with the basics.  I am one of the fortunate ones because I have water facilities in my 
<br/>office, we can always go and have shower in my office, so when we talk about basic infrastructures, 
<br/>start first with water.  We have not had water for three days but I am one of the fortunate ones.  So I 
<br/>am glad that honourable Usamate has stated that they are going to ensure that they will address this.  
<br/>I pray that we have water tomorrow, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with regards to the informal settlements, the growth of the informal settlements 
<br/>with all due respect cannot be largely blamed on Government because iTaukei landowners, some of 
<br/>them  or  most  of  them  had  given  it  out  to  people  who  were  looking  for  land  to  lease.    But  what 
<br/>concerns me are the penalties that are in place; you have $20,000 or 10-year leases for the informal 
<br/>settlers that refuse to leave, we are penalising them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  issue  for  us  is,  where  is  affordable  housing?    They  have  talked  about  unprecedented 
<br/>economic growth, they have been in power since 2006, we need more affordable housing and we 
<br/>have professional people who are staying in informal settlements.  We need to empower people, we 
<br/></span><span>need to stop spoon-feeding them.  Most of us here, our families came from the villages and see where 
<br/></span><span>we are now?  I refuse for my children to be given fish, I tell them, “you need to learn how to fish.”  
<br/>This is not the way our forefathers lived. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- You will have your time, Honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Employment  spoke  about  confidence  of  getting  Government 
<br/>through this pandemic with a high vaccination rate.  Now, what he forgets to mention that many lost 
<br/>their jobs as they chose not to be vaccinated.  Do not get me wrong, I got vaccinated.  But for many 
<br/>businesses, they were told, “If you do not have the COVID protocols, your business will close.”  So 
<br/>let us call it what it is.  A lot of our civil servants, a lot of our teachers have lost their jobs because 
<br/>they chose their democratic right not to be vaccinated and we respect that.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regards to the Vuvale Programme, I believe either my friend the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Employment or honourable Minister for Agriculture mentioned about this.  We have had over 4,000 
<br/>people who have gone overseas and just this evening I saw the Fijian Elections Office had stated that 
<br/>those abroad that wished to register, they need to make their way to the embassies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I shared this information with a friend of mine, she said, “My goodness, do they know 
<br/>how far it is to travel from Auckland down to Wellington?  This is not like travelling from here to 
<br/>Ba or here to Navua.”  There needs to be a better system because our concern, apart from the 4,000 
<br/>that have gone for the Vuvale</span><span> </span><span>Programme, we have a lot of Fijians out there that want to register, 
<br/>that want to vote, and more importantly they want this Government out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I read through the FEO Report of 2018, we had a little over 1,000 postal ballot votes 
<br/>that came from abroad (that is tallied) and now we heard this evening ballot votes that came from 
<br/>abroad, a little over 1,000, that is tallied.  Now, we heard this evening 4,000 of our people went under 
<br/>this Vuvale Programme and that should be a concern to all of us because we want our people to vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will wrap it up now but just to add, we can come here give all our glorious 
<br/>speeches, we can scream and shout but let me ensure every one of us here, our people already know 
<br/></span><span>who they are going to vote for.  They already know, but this is to you FijiFirst Government, your 
<br/></span><span>season in power is over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- You are on borrowed race card, you are finished and your season is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the 
<br/>debate  on  the  Revised  2021-2022  Budget  financial  year  that  was  presented  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy in this august House on 24th March, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Members of Cabinet, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament: from the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also share 
<br/>my disappointment in the way this Revised Budget Estimate has been railroaded through Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the words of Calvin College, the 30th President of United States, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no independence quite so much, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>living within your means.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are only three scenarios that the Financial Management Act under Section 13(a), allow 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for a Revised Budget Estimates: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>An economic shock occurs, and if you are referring to the pandemic, we had already passed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the COVID-19 Response Budget in 2020 and our economy is slowly recovering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>The  effects  of  economic  shock  cannot  be  accommodated  through  the  annual  budget.  
<br/>Assistance provided to Government through loans, grants, direct budget support and aid in 
<br/>kind totalled $1.8 billion. Therefore, the honourable Attorney-General should have enough 
<br/>money in the kitty to take us through. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>The deviation must be approved by Cabinet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we thank the honourable Attorney-General for finally listening to our 
<br/>plea from this side of the House for the last three years we are very much suspicious of the timing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>905 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>especially when we are simply three months away from the end of this financial year and we are in 
<br/>the Elections, Sir. We have always asked for an increase in minimum wage from 2018 and we thank 
<br/>you for doing so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly, Sir, SODELPA had planned to do that from day one with the minimum wage 
<br/>of $4 an hour.  The SODELPA Government would have taken back our port of entries operation in 
<br/>order for Government to absorb any fluctuations in free charges at our ports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the removal of Value Added Tax on the basic food items, it is only proper 
<br/>that they do that since it was FijiFirst Government that levied the 9 per cent on the supply of goods 
<br/>and services from 1st January, 2016.  The honourable Attorney-General should have waived VAT in 
<br/>his COVID-19 Response Budget then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  the  Opposition  side  that  had  been  asking  Government  all  along  to  restore  all  the 
<br/>allowances that was supposed to be paid to civil servants, especially for those selfless ones serving 
<br/>in  the  frontline.   But  it pains  me  to  inform  this House  that  most  of  the civil  servants  are  silently 
<br/>enduring living in pathetic conditions in Government quarters all around Fiji. You just have to visit 
<br/>some of these quarters in the West and see the extent of damages together with termite infestation, 
<br/></span><span>because Government is not prioritising routine maintenance as the past governments used to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to give credit where it is due, I thank the Government for supporting the 
<br/>Fiji Rugby Union through the Fijian Drua.  Allow me to share some important facts that are already 
<br/>public knowledge.  Our economic growth has been on a declining trend or stagnant since 2016, even 
<br/>prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,  investment is at its lowest level and remain weak, poverty and 
<br/>hardship continue to increase and 40 per cent of our population are living below the poverty line and 
<br/>20 per cent are facing hardship.  This was clearly pointed out by the former CEO for the Fiji Bureau 
<br/>of Statistics - my old boy, Mr. Kemueli Naiqama and his secretary; debt stock is at unsustainable 
<br/>level, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I now speak for the silent majority that are watching the Television livestream and say that 
<br/>we are tired of being lied to by the FijiFirst Government.  It is the same Commodore Bainimarama 
<br/>that  illegally  took  over  a  legitimate  government  that  had  a  debt  of  only  $2.5  billion,  that  is  now 
<br/>changing  its  tune,  that  it  is  okay  for  our  future  generation  to  inherit  a  debt  level  that  is  already 
<br/>forecasted to reach $9.1 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unemployment continues to rise, import of food continues to rise and export is on a decline, 
<br/></span><span>increase in the cost of living, a lot of issues faced by our people were directly imposed by Government 
<br/></span><span>because of some poor policies and decisions made that I have already mentioned before.  We are 
<br/>only hopeful that the Government’s Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiative will not burden our 
<br/>people further.  Key infrastructures are in depleted state: health, road and bridges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no matter how smarter we may try to paint the picture here, the reality of 
<br/>the  matter  is  outside  of  this  Parliament  and  that  is  what  our  people  have  to  endure.    Our  health 
<br/>facilities, for example, is in a very deplorable state and our people do not have a choice, like some of 
<br/>us here.  Our health services continue to be a challenge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Production of timber products continue to decline, our economy continues to be driven by 
<br/>consumption.  High liquidity of $2 billion, my colleagues had already indicated that this indicator is 
<br/>showing the reluctance on the part of the banks to lend money - s</span><span>a rere</span><span>.  They do not want to take 
<br/>risk.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High foreign reserve $3.1 billion, that would take us for the eight and a half months of import.  
<br/>The increase in foreign reserve today is more to do with the money we have been receiving from 
<br/>overseas  through  loans,  direct  budget  support  and  others  and  it  is  not  what  we  earn.    There  is  a 
<br/>reduction in remittance by 4 per cent.  Import increase by 9 per cent in January, export only increased 
<br/>by 3 per cent, an increase of trade deficit to 13.7 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to keep the trust of those who sent us here, is a huge task for this Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and there are three essential rules for winning trust: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Be trustworthy - to be trustworthy literally means being worthy of trust.  That is, you need to 
<br/>be kind of a person who can be depended upon to follow through on commitments that you 
<br/>make.  This is what we have to say - you have been awake, you have been measured and you 
<br/>have been found wanting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Create  a  reputation  -  to  create  a  reputation  you  must  transform  your  commitments  into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>publicly available information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, if we have to go around Fiji and ask the people for a word synonymous with the reputation 
<br/>of the FijiFirst Government, the word will be ‘dinau’.  We say that you have been weighed, you have 
<br/></span><span>been measured, you have been found wanting.  When people realise that you are capable executing 
<br/></span><span>simple task day after day they naturally believe correctly that you can be counted upon to deliver, 
<br/>day in and day out.  The FijiFirst has been consistent with its false promises and for that we again 
<br/>say you have been weighed, you have been measured and you have been found wanting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Darlene Ouimet, a mental health advocate pointed out and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Controllers, abusers and manipulative people do not question themselves. They do 
<br/>not ask themselves if the problem is them.  They always say the problem is someone else.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, our people can no longer be fooled by this campaign budget and come what may, they 
<br/>will surely respond accordingly to the FijiFirst Government - you have been weighed, you have been 
<br/>measured and you have been found wanting.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to contribute to the motion 
<br/>at hand specifically on some of the issues raised, not wanting to repeat what has been mentioned 
<br/>particularly on the overall economic situation as mentioned by the Leader of Opposition and other 
<br/>speakers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specifically the revised Budget refers to the First Home Programme. I note that a budget of 
<br/>$4 million was allocated assisting 211 families assuming that is divided evenly we are looking at 
<br/>$18,900  per  family.    The  revised  Budget  is  providing  $5.9  million  in  funding  for  this  particular 
<br/>support.  Just next to that there is a Social Housing Programme of $10,000 grant, so when I look at 
<br/>the  two  this  Social  Housing  Programme  Grant  is  basically  geared  towards  our  villages  and 
<br/>settlements.    If  you  divide  that  $18,900  and  the  other  is  $10,000  -  my  question  is  the  difference 
<br/>between those two - it would be good to relook at that in terms of that difference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  Home  Programme  and  the  grant  under  the  Social  Housing  Programme.    It  seems 
<br/>discriminatory against those in villages and settlements.  In terms of the Social Housing Programme 
<br/>again if we look at the two there is one budgeted for $600,000 Social Housing Programme and the 
<br/>First Home Programme $5.9 million.  So, there is a huge difference of $5.3 million which again is 
<br/>something which needs to be looked at.  In terms of the First Home Programme it would be good to 
<br/>expand that into not only First Home Buyers under the current terms and conditions but also for those 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>907 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who  are  building  their  houses  in  villages.      This  is  something  which  we  have  been  asking  and 
<br/>requesting also pointing out to the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also notice the iTaukei Land Development - $4 million has been allocated. There are specific 
<br/>areas  which  have  been  developed  and  that  is  very  positive.  But  in  comparison  again  to  other 
<br/>developments  I  see  that  has  something  which  needs  to  be  improved  in  terms  of  iTaukei  Land 
<br/>Development not only that but in terms of overall development of iTaukei standard of living and also 
<br/>business development and from my perspective that is something which this government has ignored 
<br/>and I do not think their heart is really in it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, because of the ideology of the government which is equal citizenry, maybe they 
<br/>see that as discriminatory.  When we come in after the next Election that is something which we will 
<br/>be  developing  not  lip  service  to  the  iTaukei  landowners  but  fully  involving  them  in  business 
<br/>development and partnership with investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What about you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I will partner with you.  Not only that Sir, but we had consistently 
<br/></span><span>requested the return of State lands which have not been used.  I had brought up to this House the 
<br/></span><span>petition on the Suvavou lands in terms of around the Suva Peninsula and some of the State lands 
<br/>which have not been utilised by the State needs to be returned and gain not only in Suva but there are 
<br/>other parcels of land around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government had mentioned something about land claims tribunal but they have 
<br/>never actioned it.  I have not seen them action that and Tui Suva had written to the Suva City Council 
<br/>at one stage about the Botanical Gardens which had been taken up at one stage by the Indian High 
<br/>Commission but that did not eventuate.  So, on behalf of Tui Suva and his people, I am asking that, 
<br/>that land be reverted back to Tui Suva and his people.  He had written to the Ministry of Lands and 
<br/>so far there has been no response on that and again I am reiterating here that this government is just 
<br/>paying lip service to the indigenous people of the nation.  They need to be serious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They need to be serious about the development of the indigenous people. As mentioned also 
<br/>in the Budget, Nadi floods.  It is mentioned there that they will be pressing ahead with the Nadi River 
<br/>Flood Alleviation, it was held by COVID-19.  I am not sure what was the issue there but the people 
<br/></span><span>of Nadi have been raising this issue not only in the past two years but before that and there has been 
<br/></span><span>unsatisfactory progress regarding this project.  We are hoping that will be fast tracked soon and not 
<br/>only that, in terms of … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of riverbank erosion, I also would like to mention the Rewa River Banks which have 
<br/>been rapidly deteriorating not only the ones which was constructed before your government came in, 
<br/>but in other areas too.  So, there is rapid erosion of the river bank not only from rise in sea level but 
<br/>also from the operation of those extracting sand.  If  you go to Toga, Muana Village, the Chinese 
<br/>operation there, the riverbank has eroded by about maybe 50 metres in the last five to ten years and 
<br/>that  has  claimed  farm  lands  et  cetera  and  I  am  urging  that  that  be  looked  at  in  terms  of  budget 
<br/>preparation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  issue  on  fertilizers,  government  has  mentioned  that  it  is  stepping  in  to  cover  the 
<br/>enterprise of a bag of fertilizer which was $45 per bag, now it is $80 per bag in which the farmers 
<br/>pay $20 and the government will pay the remaining $60 through an additional $9.7 million as a form 
<br/>of assistance.  That is fine, but the issue that I wanted to raise is what about the non-sugar farmers.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What kind of assistance is given to them in terms of fertilizer?   However, also the weedicides and 
<br/>pesticides.  In the last 12 months the price had gone up about three or four times.  It used to be $8 
<br/>now it is nearly $20 and again that has severely affected our non-sugar farmers like dalo, tavioka and 
<br/>all those farmers.  Unfortunately, I did not see that and that is another criticism of this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  next  one  just  quickly,  Sir,  I  did  not  hear  them  mention  cost-cutting  measures  or 
<br/>expenditure  control  and  we  believe  that  should  start  from  the  salaries  of  the  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>Ministers, Assistant Ministers, cost cutting should start there and we have always stressed that these 
<br/>are excessive for a developing country such as Fiji and with those cost cutting and cutting operational 
<br/>expenditure for example, leasing of vehicles, grants to certain government entities, those who have 
<br/>not provided their annual reports and all that, we would certainly see an improvement in the financial 
<br/>situation of the government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General had mentioned yesterday that only fools will oppose the 
<br/>revised Budget. Only fools!  The premise there is that the Budget is perfect but it is not.  The revised 
<br/>Budget is not perfect and I would like to  change that phrase to read  – Only fools think that their 
<br/>revised Budget will not be scrutinised or legitimately opposed and that is why all my colleagues here 
<br/>have mentioned, the various reasons why we are opposing the Budget and I do not want to repeat 
<br/></span><span>that but just labelling anyone who opposes it as a fool is uncalled for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, one of the  Ministers,  I believe  the honourable Minister for Education, had mentioned 
<br/>recruitment – open, merit, recruitment system and the merits of this that it is a system which is perfect 
<br/>that is working perfectly et cetera, but one of the persons in one of this selection committees told me 
<br/>that they were told to rank a particular candidate to be higher than the other candidates.  That is the 
<br/>problem with this system.  That is the problem and it is not as perfect as what they are saying and I 
<br/>have mentioned in the past, the system is not full proof because biases come in and there is undue 
<br/>influence from outside and there needs to be a review to ensure that those kinds of biases and undue 
<br/>influence needs to be minimised or eliminated and that is the current issue with this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Koya mentioned we do not do handouts, I mean that is a joke because handouts 
<br/>are  going  on  left,  right  and  centre  at  the  moment.    It  is  just  going  on,  we  see  it  in  the  paper, 
<br/>everywhere. They saying it is development but these are basically handouts because it is near the 
<br/>election and it is  intensifying.    In the past  12 to 24 months, we have not  really seen this kind  of 
<br/>handouts but now it is going on nearly every week. Cane knives, forks, tractors – you name it, rice 
<br/>mills  and  I  believe  the  whole  system  needs  to  be  reviewed,  the  whole  governance  system,  the 
<br/>Constitution, the laws  relating to  elections because right  now in  the 1997 Constitution,  it used to  
<br/></span><span>cater for a caretaker government which comes in and then everybody goes out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But now they become the caretaker government until a new government comes in under the 
<br/>2013 Constitution, so we need to revert to that kind of system so there is a level playing field and 
<br/>when the race starts, we all start from the same point but here when the race starts, they are already 
<br/>at the 50-metre and we are still at the one metre point because not only that because they are also 
<br/>utilising, we are using money from our pockets to go around to our electorate, to create awareness, 
<br/>we are using it from our salaries but for them, they are using their ministerial budget.  We are doing 
<br/>the same thing.  It is awareness, campaigning, awareness, campaigning – it is the same thing.  The 
<br/>only difference is we are not giving out anything but they are giving out a lot of taxpayer-funded 
<br/>handouts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  before  I  finish,  I  would  like  to  mention  also  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  had 
<br/>mentioned, I am really concerned about this that the Opposition is stoking fear amongst landowners.  
<br/>The politics of fearmongering.  I mean, I have not seen that, I have not heard it.  I have not heard 
<br/>anyone say that.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>909 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Bill 17.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Yes, Bill 17.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Sir, on Bill 17 the main problem there is because they did not 
<br/>bring it here for colourful consultation, they brought it under Standing Order 51 and they did not do 
<br/>the  consultation  until  after  the  Bill  17  became  an  Act,  so  that  is  the  problem  we  are  facing  now 
<br/>regarding that issue.  It was not fear mongering, for example for myself, I was just explaining some 
<br/>of the issues  relating to  Bill  17.   I went  and also consulted with  some of the landowners and  we 
<br/>followed the legitimate process for example, I told them.  I did not tell them to come and stand in the 
<br/>middle of the road and block the road or do a protest.  We followed a legitimate process, or we need 
<br/>to write to the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was a very legitimate peaceful process.  You get what I am saying, that is what I am 
<br/>trying to get at.  You are saying that it was fear mongering, it was not.  I do not know who triggered 
<br/>the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to pick me up from my home close to midnight, so I 
<br/>do not know which one of you?  I asked the CID who told you to pick me up at this time?  That was 
<br/>during the curfew and they said, it is orders from higher up.  Of course, they will not tell me, they 
<br/></span><span>might get sacked the next day, but anyway that was not fear mongering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is fear mongering is the Commissioner of Police maybe three or four days ago saying, 
<br/>“police ready to prevent potential unrest” headlined in the </span><span>Fiji Sun.  </span><span> That is fear mongering and he 
<br/>said, the elements from past </span><span>coups </span><span>in 1987 and 2000, et cetera are still around.  He did not mention 
<br/>2006, what happened in 2006, it was an overthrown of a legitimately elected government.  He did 
<br/>not mention it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am trying to emphasise here is that, the Commissioner of Police is 
<br/>being selective, I think he has become a politician.  He should stand in the Election, not only him, 
<br/>but there were few other civil servants who were making political statements.  They were replying 
<br/>directly to the elected Members of Parliament as if they are honourable Ministers, so they should 
<br/>resign, they are making political statements.  This is uncalled for, the Government is trying to create 
<br/>economic stability and this  kind  of statement chases away potential  investors and in  terms  of the 
<br/>iTLTB was also mentioned and we would like to emphasise that in the previous Constitution, we had 
<br/>the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) which were the overall governing body of the iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we come in, we would re-establish them, because at the moment, they removed the 
<br/></span><span>GCC  and  then  replaced  it  with  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  as  Chair,  but  we  do  not  want  any 
<br/></span><span>politician  to  be  involved  there.    That  is  what  needs  to  be  done,  to  create  an  independent  iTaukei 
<br/>institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, please a Point of Order because the honourable Member 
<br/>again is misleading Parliament. He has got his law and his facts wrong.  The Chair of iTLTB prior 
<br/>to 2007 was always the honourable Minister responsible for iTaukei Affairs, not the GCC.  He knows 
<br/>that, honourable Lalabalavu was the Chair of iTLTB, Laisenia Qarase was the Chair of iTLTB, not 
<br/>the GCC.  He is again misleading Parliament, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers responsible for iTaukei Affairs had been Chairs, it is not the GCC.  You are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talking about Director, we are talking about Chair and he said the GCC is incorrect, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Anyway, thank you honourable Attorney-General. Yes, what I 
<br/>was trying to emphasise was that, when we come in, we will ensure that the Great Council of Chiefs 
<br/>nominees  are  in  overall  charge  of  iTLTB  and  not  elected  politicians.  Because  the  whole  iTaukei

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs structure- iTLTB, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Provincial  Councils have been politicised 
<br/>under the FijiFirst and that is something we need to fix  when we come in. I will continue at the next 
<br/>session of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- As the nation waited with bated breath last night for the 
<br/>delivery of the revised budget, many Fijians waited without having had a decent meal. Many Fijians 
<br/>waited without water in our taps and many still do tonight.  Many Fijians waited while not being able 
<br/>to afford a decent home, a decent roof over their heads.  Many Fijians waited wondering what their 
<br/>children would have for lunch today. The majority of the Fijian people today are tired of waiting. So 
<br/>last night, the least the government could have done was to have some decency and show up on time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Waiting, waiting, waiting—this is the legacy of the FijiFirst Government.  Promises made so 
<br/>eloquently, so vigorously, so loudly are meant to be kept. The greatest test of any budget is getting 
<br/>things done. Unfortunately, the government has shown us time and time again that behind  all the 
<br/>puffery and the chest beating and the long winded speeches is a chronic inability to get things done 
<br/>right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget reflects the  Government's character of being strung along by short-term  gains 
<br/></span><span>rather than long-term vision. Our economy was already slowing before COVID ever existed.  The 
<br/></span><span>growth was slumping, wages were stagnant, productivity was declining, investment was slowing and 
<br/>debt was rising. And yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this government had the temerity to try and convince all 
<br/>of us that everything was okay, that times had never been better.  And the promises just kept coming. 
<br/>We are still waiting for </span><span>Waila </span><span>City. We are still waiting for the Lautoka Olympic Swimming Pool. 
<br/>We are still waiting for the Vunidawa Sporting Complex. The grounds for which was graded and 
<br/>now has turned into a lovely grazing padded for bullocks, cows and horses in Vunidawa.  We are still 
<br/>waiting for the Ba Hospital to open. We are still waiting for the New CWM Maternity Unit. We are 
<br/>still waiting for the Lautoka High Court Complex. We are still waiting for local government elections. 
<br/>This list is too long for me to complete - waiting, waiting, and more waiting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure, however, polished last night’s speech was, the result will be the same again. More 
<br/>waiting,  more  promises  left  unfulfilled  and  more  families  left  disappointed.  Why  does  the 
<br/>government think that it was so hard to convince the public last year to adhere to their COVID-19 
<br/>measures? It is because the people do not trust them. And the people can no longer wait to kick them 
<br/>out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do have to say that NFP supports three policies in the revised Budget only 
<br/></span><span>because if you look at it closely, it is merely a repackaging of what NFP has been saying all along. 
<br/></span><span>When we said that we were going to introduce a decent living wage, the government said we cannot 
<br/>afford it. When we wanted to have 23 basic items VAT exempted, the government through its former 
<br/>FRCS  Board  Chairperson,  Mr.  Kodagoda,  said,  “It  will  not  benefit  any  Fijian  and  that  its 
<br/>implementation would be chaotic.”  Just three months ago, Mr. Speaker, when we wanted a removal 
<br/>of  the  20  cents  fuel  tax,  way  before  the  price  of  crude  oil  increased  due  to  Russia’s  invasion  of 
<br/>Ukraine, the honourable Attorney-General is on  record saying, “the idea was stupendously stupid.”  
<br/>How  bitter  must  it  be  for  the  honourable  Attorney-General  to  eat  his  own  words  “stupendously 
<br/>stupid”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But let us put FijiFirst aside for a second, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I want to address the Fiji 
<br/>people directly.  You are what makes this nation great.  In times of need and trouble, we show that 
<br/>we could come together regardless of what shenanigans the Government was up to, to help our fellow 
<br/>Fijians in need.  Fijians overseas, through remittances kept this nation afloat.  Fijian health workers 
<br/>braved weather and long distance travel to get us vaccinated.  Civil Society Organisations including 
<br/>FRIEND and the District Council of Social Services all over the country and other NGOs took the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>911 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lead in helping fellow Fijians.  Fijian bus drivers, road workers, security guards and everyone else, 
<br/>all of you gave your hands and your hearts to keep this nation going.  All the credit should belong to 
<br/>you, not to the politicians in this Parliament.  ‘ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is your courage, your determination and your sacrifices that should not go to waste.  This 
<br/>pandemic recovery is a once in a generation opportunity to re-assess the status quo and re-balance 
<br/>the scales. This should be our opportunity to launch ourselves on the trajectory to a more sustainable, 
<br/>more green, more fair and more secure future for all of us, a future we can be proud to bequeath to 
<br/>our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  future  begins  with  education.    The  NFP  has  already  announced  that  it  will  continue 
<br/>ensuring that education remains free all the way through to Year 13 but free education does not mean 
<br/>quality education.  To that end, we have made it our policy to establish an Education Commission to 
<br/>conduct a full scale review of our education system.  We want to know if our students are getting the 
<br/>best education they need to prepare them for the challenges facing the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century.  This will be 
<br/>done  within  the  first  month  of  an  NFP  Government.  We  will  consider  the  Commission’s 
<br/>recommendations seriously and consult all stakeholders; teachers, parents and students themselves 
<br/>to bring the recommendations into full effect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, for those of us who cannot afford to jet overseas every time we need quality medical 
<br/>care, our only choice is to rely on our health system at home.  For many of us, that is a death sentence.  
<br/>This is the not fault of the hardworking nurses and doctors who are doing their very best with what 
<br/>little they have.  The fact is that proper investment and oversight in the health system has been lacking 
<br/>over the last few years.  This will have to change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be conducting a full scale inquiry into the wastage and inefficiencies plaguing the 
<br/>health  system.    We  will  consult  experts  and  we  will  hold  those  who  have  contributed  to  the 
<br/>deterioration of our health system to account.  Our people deserve better.  Under an NFP Government, 
<br/>hardworking Fijians will get what they deserve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly,  of  course,  is  our  economy.    The  NFP  Leader  has  made  it  clear  many  times  in 
<br/>Parliament that at least $3 billion had been lost between 2015 and 2020, stolen out of the hands of 
<br/>everyday hardworking Fijians through wastage, pilferage, mismanagement and corruption.  We will 
<br/>be  lodging  a  full  scale  inquiry  into  all  instances  of  corruption,  shady  dealings,  under  the  table 
<br/>handshakes and the rest.  Let me be clear to you, whether you are in Government or out of it, if you 
<br/>have been involved in corruption, we will come down hard on you.  You will not escape, the long 
<br/></span><span>arm of the law will follow you wherever you may try to hide.          
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to  the  FijiFirst  Government,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir, it is  clear that this is the Budget  of  a 
<br/>Government desperately gasping for its last breaths.  But there is no doubt, nothing will save them 
<br/>now. They are all tired and the Fijian people are tired of them.  The title of the 1978 song performed 
<br/>by John Mathis and Deniece Williams and I am sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you know the song and you 
<br/>would have probably sung it as well, should have been the title of this Revised Budget.  The song is 
<br/>“Too Much, Too Little, Too Late”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the capital grant to Water Authority of Fiji was last night 
<br/>cut by a staggering $8 million.  This a few days after the Minister responsible was forced to admit 
<br/>that they do not have enough money for upgrade projects.  The Fijian people have no reason to trust 
<br/>FijiFirst ever again, they cannot even keep the water on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Attorney-General, 
<br/>honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members and to the thousands of Fijians watching this on

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian Government Facebook page; Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to fully support the Revised 2021-2022 
<br/>Fijian National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like many Fijians, I would to thank the honourable Minister of Economy, his hardworking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>team for leading us through the times to get where we are today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this budget is further proof that FijiFirst Government listens to the people.  
<br/>Many of the benefits are directly provided from feedback given during nationwide consultations. We 
<br/>have  seen  the  direct  impacts  of  both  COVID-19  and  more  recently  the  war  between  Russia  and 
<br/>Ukraine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> hit us, the Opposition cheered hoping that that would be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of us but we came back again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  when  COVID-19 hit us, the Opposition cheered  again  hopping that this 
<br/>would  be  the  end  of  the  FijiFirst  Government.  The  Honourable  Pio  Tikoduadua  actually  said  on 
<br/>record that the FijiFirst Government was lucky that COVID-19 came along. There are screenshots 
<br/>he  cannot  deny  that.  What  kind  of  person  says  this  “no  one  is  lucky  because  COVID-19  came’.  
<br/></span><span>Millions of people died worldwide, the only thing lucky is that NFP was not running Government or 
<br/></span><span>we would still be on lockdown.  In fact you are lucky that the FijiFirst Government, under our Prime 
<br/>Minister’s leadership, saw us through this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  inflation  has  increased  all  around  the  world  and  if  the  Opposition  were 
<br/>truthful they would tell the people that this is because of the war in Ukraine.  Russia provides 12 per 
<br/>cent of the world’s oil and this means that prices will naturally increase. Fuel will also increase the 
<br/>price of everything else and Fiji has no choice in the matter because we are price taker, that is why I 
<br/>commend the removal of the fuel tax as it leaves the burden of Fijians. It is a smart move considering 
<br/>the current global climate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> continues their irresponsible and unethical reporting. 
<br/>They  falsely  claimed that  there was additional duty on oil prices to  help  compensate for  revenue 
<br/>losses.  If honourable Gavoka and honourable Professor Prasad were really honourables they would 
<br/>call the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also commend the honourable Attorney-General for responsibly increasing 
<br/>the minimum wage rate which will be done in several steps.  This is the proper way to do it, because 
<br/></span><span>many factors need to be considered.  Honourable Professor Prasad claimed that we had followed his 
<br/></span><span>failed manifesto that lost him his second election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In any other party, Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  you lose on election,  you  get  replaced, but  for some 
<br/>reason honourable Professor Prasad refuses to let go.  His manifesto irresponsibly wanted to bump 
<br/>the minimum wage rate to $5 without consultation.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason that the NFP was 
<br/>rejected for the second time, was because of their leader, his lies were caught. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First he said that he would make the minimum wage rate at $5, then in the next interview he 
<br/>said he would give it 100 days and then in the third interview he said he would consider it after 100 
<br/>days.  What kind of manifesto and leader is this?  We all know that the true leader of NFP is Sitiveni 
<br/>Rabuka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a cane farmer, it is like what honourable Professor Prasad said that 
<br/>minimum wage rate should be $5, it scares farmers like me.  How will we pay our workers?  The 
<br/>truth is, honourable Professor Prasad, honourable Gavoka and Sitiveni Rabuka will never understand 
<br/>cane farmers like us.  These people do not understand that you cannot just grab a random number out

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the air, it has to be done progressively.  We cannot raise the minimum wage rate all at once, as 
<br/>some Opposition MPs suggest.  Instead, we must increase it slowly over a year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If minimum wage rate is increased all at once, prices for everything from bread to clothes 
<br/>will  sky  rocket.    The  Fijian  Government  has  acted  prudently  to  keep  domestic  inflation  low  and 
<br/>imported inflation as controlled as possible.  What the Opposition wants to do, would undo over 15 
<br/>years of hard work and progress overnight.  The minimum wage rate increase will, by January next 
<br/>year,  ensure  that  all  workers  on  minimum  wage  rate  receive  $50  more  every  week  for  the  same 
<br/>amount of work.  This Government is also taking actual steps to assist cane farmers through fertiliser 
<br/>subsidies and many other incentives which really help because of the global shortage of fertiliser.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those farmers who are looking to plant other crops but are afraid of losing their leases, 
<br/>through the alternative lease option for sugar cane growers/farmers, Government will be stepping in.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $500,000 is allocated to support cane growers who are looking to  convert their 
<br/>sugar cane leases to agricultural leases to plant other crops or even for 99 year residential lease - what 
<br/>a wonderful initiative.  That again shows the FijiFirst Government is committed to leaving no one 
<br/>behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to be part of the Government that provides free GPs, medicine, 
<br/></span><span>24-hour open heart surgery in Lautoka and soon dental.  This practically unheard of in other more 
<br/>developed countries.  This Budget gives us everything from free medicine to open heart surgeries.  
<br/>What else does the Opposition want?  Despite being a small Pacific Island nation, we are able to 
<br/>afford these services through prudent and smart management of the Government’s resources and our 
<br/>economy, and work to remove the unnecessary bureaucracy that prevents talented doctors from being 
<br/>able to practice their own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Opposition to stop spreading fake news because it hurts all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>poor souls who believe their lies.  I also urge the Opposition to have a bit more guts and honesty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  has  the  habit  of  picking  on  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General and stays away after making his statement.  He has done exactly the same, running 
<br/>away like a rat, he quickly scurried away after chattering and squeaking like a rat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Can you understand what I am saying?  I am not saying he is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rat, I am saying he is like a rat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  Sitiveni  Rabuka  stand  struck  SODELPA,  he  was  the  Opposition 
<br/>Leader.  He removed honourable Professor Prasad from all the Committees.  (He is supposed to be 
<br/>here) His team is spreading fake videos of honourable Qereqeretabua on social media and they are 
<br/>on the verge of taking Charan Jeath Singh from NFP.  Yet, honourable Professor Prasad continues to 
<br/>run under Rabuka’s table at every opportunity.  They are willing to stage themselves and all Fijians 
<br/>just because of their personal hate of the Honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say these things because it shows these people are opposing for the sake 
<br/>of opposing just like last night when the whole nation once angry at them for delaying the Budget 
<br/>announcement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, many large countries are still trying to fight this virus and navigate through 
<br/>poor economic conditions.  I am proud to be part of the Government that looks at the smart solutions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for their people and do not just put ideas and numbers out of thin air.  We are focussed on recovery 
<br/>because we owe it to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Revised 2021-2022 National Budget and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hereby declare it a Budget that will help Fiji to recover.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings to an end the list of speakers and I now 
<br/>call upon the Attorney-General and Minister of Economy, Civil Service, Communications, Housing 
<br/>and Community Development to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is somewhat difficult, I would say, to 
<br/>make  a  summary  of  what  needs  to  be  said  in  terms  of  rounding  off  the  debate  given  the  very 
<br/>pedestrian contribution from Members of the Opposition in particular when they in fact challenge 
<br/>the fact whether we should have a budget or not, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you very correctly highlighted, Sir, last year in July when we did present the Budget we 
<br/>said because of the pandemic and because of the number of variables that were still up in the air that 
<br/>we  may  need  to  actually  do  a  mini-budget  or  a  revised  budget  which  precisely  what  we  did.  As 
<br/></span><span>honourable Selai highlighted we spent nearly over one-hour yesterday about simply the Opposition 
<br/></span><span>making those kinds of contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Saukuru, for example, later on said, “Well the pandemic is gone” but the effects 
<br/>of the pandemic are still felt.  When the last budget was delivered, Sir, we still had the borders closed.  
<br/>When the budget was passed, the borders were still closed. We still had social distancing, we had 
<br/>people wearing masks and schools were closed.  The economy was in fact in a siege and then of 
<br/>course the borders opened on 1</span><span>st</span><span> December and yet they continuously since yesterday and whole of 
<br/>today have said that this is unnecessary, that there needs to be some kind of economic shock and by 
<br/>jove there is an enormous economic shock globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trillions of dollars have been put into economies by the richer countries through quantitative 
<br/>easing.   Countries have come to a standstill and they are somehow or the other think that Fiji is some 
<br/>kind of bubble that we have not been impacted upon by this global pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we were to go to the heart of it, there is not at a single line mentioned by 
<br/>any of the Members on this side unless they responded to it and indeed in the Budget statement last 
<br/>night, not once did we mention election  yet the entire reaction from the other side was,  “oh, it is 
<br/></span><span>election budget.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immediately,  when  we  were  announcing  about  the  VAT  reduction  -  our  election.    A  few 
<br/>months  ago  they  were  talking  about  reduction  they  did  not  say  election.    When  we  make  an 
<br/>announcement then say it is election. Not once did we mention election, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  listen  to  the  contribution  by  the  Members  and  as  the  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>highlighted, if you look at the contributions and under his leadership, the FijiFirst Government, Sir, 
<br/>has been critically involved and in fact is very much determined to make structural changes within 
<br/>the economy to unlock the Fijian potential. It is precisely what we are doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Drua</span><span> is one such example. If we had not invested the funds, they wanted a grant from 
<br/>us, if we had not done that, </span><span>Drua </span><span>would not be in a good footing now.  It could have actually closed 
<br/>down the franchise.  We, by law could not fund </span><span>Drua</span><span> if it is a private entity, so we came up with a 
<br/>solution and it is a creative solution.  It is thinking outside the box and that is, we actually become a 
<br/>shareholder in the </span><span>Drua</span><span> franchise. That is to allow for a period of handholding, a period of injection 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>915 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of capital into that organisation until such time, as we can see </span><span>Drua </span><span>performing really well, that it 
<br/>has the capacity to be able to attract other private investors and then the Government can then step 
<br/>aside and allow for that franchise to continue.  That precisely, things like what the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister mentioned, the changes through iTLTB in terms of ensuring that we are getting the leases 
<br/>done properly and getting professional valuers. What all of these does Sir, is increases the value of 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have pontificated, they have used ethnicity, they have used land  and they have used 
<br/>GCC.  All of the previous governments have done that, yet not a single shred of outside thinking box 
<br/>has taken place. Now, honourable Tuisawau is running down the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land development saying it 
<br/>is not enough.  It was under this Prime Minister that we started the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone  went  on  about,  “oh,  we  are  asset  rich  but  cash  poor”  this  is  a  practical  way  of 
<br/>ensuring that they become cash rich also.  No one did that.  Even things like, for example, changes 
<br/>in the commission rate for real estate agents.  In the GP system, it is unlocking the potential, it is 
<br/>bringing new partners into the economic structure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the solutions they have provided, there is no unlocking of potential.  There are 
<br/></span><span>no  structural  changes,  they  do  not  have  the  audacity  to  do  that.    You  need  to  be  able  to  have  a 
<br/></span><span>particular  level  of  vision  and  have  that  audacity  to  be  able  to  change  the  structures.    There  is  an 
<br/>enormous significant difference between what we represent on this side, what we represent under our 
<br/>leader and what they represent under their leaders, or I should say leaders.  You have a party here 
<br/>that has got one person as Leader of the Opposition and the other one is the leader of the party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We know half of them will go to paapi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Do not worry about us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Half of them go to paapi,  honourable Professor Prasad has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already gone to paapi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sorry, it is not paapi, it is PAP.  It is probably a Freudian slip because paapi actually means 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sinner.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  that  there  has  been  no  constructive  input.  
<br/></span><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua, we had recommended VAT a few years ago, yes, but there was no VMS 
<br/>system.  That is how people were fleecing the system.  Since then we have been putting in place a 
<br/>VMS system so now we can actually monitor what items in the supermarket because as we know, 
<br/>the 21 items in the supermarket will be zero rated VAT. All the other items will be 9 per cent VAT.  
<br/>People can cook the books but when you have a VMS system then you get better accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talked about reducing the duty on fuel, you cannot just simply reduce the duty on fuel 
<br/>overnight without having another revenue source.  It sucked out $56 million from the revenue stream, 
<br/>so how will that $56 million be made of?  Where will they get it from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The VAT on 21 items, $163 million reduction in revenue, direct just like that off the book.  
<br/>How will that be made of?  They did not suggest that we increase VAT on other items which we have 
<br/>done.  It is what you call “responsible government”, they go on about responsibility and transparency.  
<br/>This  is  true  responsibility  and  transparency  because  we  are  able  to  take  a  very  robust  and  very 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparent  manner  in  ensuring  that  we  have  the  right  amount  of  revenue  and  we  also  have  an 
<br/>expenditure that has been able to be controlled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On one hand they said, </span><span>dinau</span><span> because that is their narrative, </span><span>kharraza</span><span> that is their narrative.  
<br/>If  we had not  taken out  the $2 billion  debt in  COVID-19, we have a situation where the country 
<br/>suddenly overnight 50 per cent of their revenue is gone, absolutely gone.  We still need to continue 
<br/>with the basic services.  So, where will that come from?  They say, we should not have borrowed - 
<br/>so, let us cut civil service pay, let us cut medical services, let us cut social welfare, let us cut Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji and let us cut funding for FRA.  Then they will say there is no water, there is poverty 
<br/>alleviation benefits have gone.  Where would the money come from?  You see they say, “Oh! There 
<br/>is too much </span><span>dinau.”</span><span> Honourable Salote Radrodro was going on about it but she does not give an 
<br/>alternative.  She will be the first one to complain.  Honourable Bulanauca who has gone, he talked 
<br/>about the welfare going down but he does not know the reason for it.  He could very easily find out.  
<br/>The intended number of recipients, in fact, were not there because a lot of them took the $360 - $500 
<br/>million was injected into the economy to ensure people actually had food on the table, honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua talks about it.  What was the alternative?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The entire world did that and here we are - Members of the Opposition are saying this should 
<br/></span><span>not  have  been  done.    There  would  have  been  socio-economic  chaos,  people  would  become 
<br/></span><span>despondent, destitution would have prevailed in Fiji; they do not talk about that.  Then on the other 
<br/>hand they talked about debt then they said, “Oh, all the money from the General Account should be 
<br/>reimbursed into the General Account.”  Where would you get the $250 million from?  They do not 
<br/>offer the alternative.  This is why they actually object to the amendment to the Financial Management 
<br/>Act because under the Financial Management Act now, politicians like them need to account for their 
<br/>election promises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just yesterday, we got another action taken against us by one of the political parties saying 
<br/>why was the Financial Management Act put in place, they have taken us to court now.  We have got 
<br/>about  three  now  on  foot.    These  are  signs  of  desperate  politicians  who  do  not  want  to  be  held 
<br/>accountable.  The irony, of course is, they mentioned about accountability, they mentioned about 
<br/>transparency but they do not want to have it applied to themselves.  That is the irony of it, Sir. So, if 
<br/>you have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have since yesterday received enormous positive feedback on this 
<br/>Budget and as we mentioned, a lot of people are appreciative of the fact that many of the structural 
<br/>changes have been announced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For example, the blanket rezoning. So many people are very positive about that, about the 
<br/></span><span>fact that iTLTB, Ministry of Lands, surveyors, Department of Town and Country Planning, Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Economy will all get together to try and solve the survey backlog because people know, some 
<br/>landowners have called us up, they said, “This is really good because I can get now the premium paid 
<br/>to me.”  The tenants are happy because they said, “I can get my 99-year residential lease, I want to 
<br/>build a nice concrete home.” The banks are willing to lend them the money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuisawau said, “Oh, there should be equity in the amount allocated.”  That is 
<br/>such a silly proposition.  This is a grant where you give $10,000,  what used to be one-third, two-
<br/>thirds; give a$10,000 grant for a basic home to be built.  The other ones are people, for example, 
<br/>husband and wife, teachers.  They want to build a bigger home.  They can do that. They go to a bank, 
<br/>the bank approves the loan and then we give a $30,000 grant, they are building their first home.  It is 
<br/>the kind of a very simplistic approach to things. Not having a grasp of the commercial and financial 
<br/>realities.  This is what we are dealing with, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there  were some  other comments  that were made which  I  would like to 
<br/>respond  to  and  I  firstly  also  thank  all  those  people  who  had  invited  us  for  the  consultations.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>917 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Selai mentioned, honourable Biman Prasad is on record on </span><span>Fijivillage</span><span>, his latest favourite 
<br/>media  outlet  said,  “The  ministers  in  this  Government  scurry  all  over  the  country  like  squeaking, 
<br/>hissing and chattering rats.”    That is what he has called the Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  been  in  this  Parliament  where  they  have  said  to  us,  “you  do  not  know  anything 
<br/>because you are in  your offices, we know we are talking to the people” and when they see a few 
<br/>Ministers going around, honourable Seruiratu is going there, honourable Premila Kumar is going and 
<br/>consulting teachers and meeting up with them, they suddenly do not like that.  They calling us rats 
<br/>as a result of that. This is the calibre of the political intellectual input we get from the Opposition, 
<br/>Sir.  And this is why it is so difficult to be able to sometimes stand up here and respond to these kind 
<br/>of statements made by them because it would appear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the ordinary Fijians on 
<br/>the street has far better grasp of what we are trying to say, do and implement than these people here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point of the matter is this - they want to win office purely to acquire 
<br/>power,  not  to  improve  the  lives  of  people,  not  to  improve  the  systems,  not  to  ensure  long-term 
<br/>economic longevity and stability and confidence building; they do not want that.  If  you listen to 
<br/>every single thing they have said, that is what it leads to.  They do not care.  Honourable Tuisawau 
<br/>went on about Bill 17; there is no more Bill 17, there is Act 22 of 2021.  He said no consultation 
<br/></span><span>teams went out.  That was nonsense.  That is not a consultative issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They actually went out to educate people as to what happened because they spread so much 
<br/>misinformation  including  the  lady  who  you  replaced.    They  went  around  spreading  so  much 
<br/>misinformation.   Everyone knew that there were five things that the landowners have to  agree to 
<br/>before leases can be given. So, 60 per cent of the landowners need to give consent.  They have to 
<br/>agree for the type of lease that they will give, they have to agree for the term of lease that will be 
<br/>there, they have to agree to the premium and they have to agree to the yearly lease rental.  These are 
<br/>the five things that the landowners must consent to before any lease can be issued either through 
<br/>iTLTB or the Ministry of Lands if they want to give it under Land Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>None of these rights, Sir, were affected by Act 22 of 2021, he knows that.  It was only the 
<br/>administrative side of things where the Director for Lands in terms of State land had to consent for 
<br/>water, electricity and mortgage and so did the iTLTB CEO.  That was removed, none of the rights of 
<br/>the  landowners  were  affected.    People  in  the  grassroots  understand  that  now,  we  were  in  Nadi 
<br/>wherepeople  talked  about  it  and  they  said,  “We  have  been  misled  and  they  are  now  willing  to 
<br/>engage.”    A  lot  more  people  are  willing  to  engage  the  iTaukei  land  development.    This  is  their 
<br/>narrative, they know that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank those people who attended in Nadi, Lautoka, people 
<br/>asked for ad hoc budget consultations in Nubu, Nasinu, Nausori, Kavanagasau, Kulukulu, Labasa, 
<br/>Savusavu, Olosara and Koronivia.  We also had online sessions - in fact we had online sessions only 
<br/>for women on International Women’s Day.  A lot of women sent questions, we responded to those 
<br/>questions, where is the lack of transparency?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also would like to make because I think the honourable 
<br/>Members do not appreciate when people used to talk about basic food items, and they are not even 
<br/>basic food, it used to be flour, rice, tinned fish, cooking oil, tea, powdered milk and kerosene.  Today, 
<br/>we have 21 items, they include essentials also like sanitary pads for women, toothpaste, toilet paper, 
<br/>soap, washing powder and all the other items, garlic, potato, onion, tinned fish, cooking oil; all of 
<br/>those things you can make a meal out of it, it forms the basis of a meal.  If you have a veggie patch, 
<br/>you can get some </span><span>bele</span><span>, cassava, </span><span>dal</span><span>o, </span><span>bhindi, bhaji</span><span> and you can complete three meals.  That is what 
<br/>this does.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have said Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it has been  done because the freight cost in recent 
<br/>times has shot through the roof, because we now have a system that we can monitor so supermarkets 
<br/>are not going to rip off FRCS because that is what they used to do. There used to be doubled book-
<br/>keeping; they do not mentioned that.  They do not think about those fundamentals.  They are only 
<br/>doing this for show.  There is no real commitment to ensure there is integrity within our financial 
<br/>system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Saukuru  talked  about  liquidity  means  there  are  no  costs,  banks  are  not 
<br/>lending,  what  a  lot  of  baloney.    No  one  goes  out  to  borrow  during  COVID-19  when  there  is  a 
<br/>lockdown and the reason why we did that (it feels like I am teaching people Economics and Financial 
<br/>Systems) because we knew that the tourism brings $2 billion year revenue to us.  They bring foreign 
<br/>exchange,  so  we  had  to  preposition  ourselves  to  know  that  when  the  borders  open  up,  when  the 
<br/>economies  open  up,  that  we  still  have  enough  foreign  currency  to  be  able  to  continue  with  our 
<br/>imports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thus  the  equation  was  deliberately  changed,  so  we  can  get  more  foreign  currency  in  our 
<br/>system.  We borrowed more from offshore and guess what, the interest rates we paid was 0.01 per 
<br/>cent, AIDA Funds was 0 per cent, only 0.75 per cent,  they do not talk about that.  That is why our 
<br/></span><span>debt  have  gone  up  to  $9  billion,  yes,  but  what  is  the  grant  component  of  it?    This  is  the  lack  of 
<br/></span><span>sophisticated  analysis  by  the  other  side,  lack  of  nuance  approach  to  it  and  they  want  to  run 
<br/>government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister when he went around talking about climate change, you all 
<br/>berated him.  As a result of those words, today we are getting access to concessional financing.  None 
<br/>of them mentioned climate change in their speech.  I remembered in 1972 when I was seven years 
<br/>old, there was </span><span>Hurricane Bebe</span><span>.  The next cyclone that came was 10 years later.  Today, we get three 
<br/>cyclones in one season.  As I mentioned the other day, Kabisi, Nawai, Semo roads are half the road 
<br/>is gone.  At Kabisi, the entire road went, the highway built by the Australians in the 1970s.  A huge 
<br/>saturation of the earth because of downpour, not even a cyclone, just heavy rain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  </span><span>TC  Yas</span><span>a,  it  rained  in  one  day,  the  amount  of  rain  we  got  in  24  hours  is  the  same 
<br/>amount of rain that London received in one year. They do not talk about that, absolutely nothing. 
<br/>When they mentioned water, they just think it has come out of here and there is no such thing as 
<br/>cyclone, Lala land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government think about the fundamentals and therefore 
<br/>when we talk about debt and when we talk about revenue, you need to have a sophisticated approach 
<br/>and you need to understand things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And we know that they have a former Permanent Secretary advising them, hanging around 
<br/>the Parliament and that is the calibre of people they are actually liaising with.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they 
<br/>talked a lot about Civil service. I would like to highlight very quickly, Sir.  Let  us talk about the 
<br/>honourable Salote Radrodro talking about nurses and saying that they are leaving because we do not 
<br/>look after them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the OMRS was introduced, there was also a salary evaluation done. A clinical sister, 
<br/>specialised nurse before the OMRS is implemented, NU06 used to get $19,131. She/he had a 49.52 
<br/>per  cent  salary  increment  up  to  $28,605.45.    For  NU05  -  $21,175  went  up  by  35.09  per  cent  of 
<br/>$28,605.35.  For maternity, all departments nurse practitioner NU04 was $24,566 before OMRS and 
<br/>afterwards, the salary went up to $43,296.63 with an increase of 76.25 per cent overnight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  do  not  talk  about  that,  they  would  not  mention  them  as  it  does  not  fit  in  with  their 
<br/>narrative.  They want to portray all these Ministers the civil service, the PSC, the Prime Minister as 
<br/>some kind of a tyrannical regime over the Civil service.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on about what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="105">Page 105</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>919 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened in the education sector, what salary bands went up. We have heads of schools that can get 
<br/>up to $97,000. Some have stepped up at $59,000 with the potential to move along. This is the reality 
<br/>underground. They do not mention that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Gavoka thinks like the puppy outside. He said that we need to have security 
<br/>of tenure.  He worked in the private sector, no one gave you job for life. The three year contract, five 
<br/>year contract. No Civil servant does not get their contract renewed if they are performing. If they 
<br/>perform, then they get can their contract renewed. The first time the job occupies three years, second 
<br/>time five years and continuation of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  they  continue  five  years,  comes  up  for  the  renewal,  another  five  years.  That  is  what  is 
<br/>actually happening but they want to portray these narratives.  And of course, if you do not perform, 
<br/>you need to be held accountable. You will be the first people to complain if a citizen goes and gets 
<br/>treated unfairly, inappropriately or discourteously by civil servant.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, again this is the 
<br/>narrative that they are putting on to the floor of this Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  going  now  in  to  the  Bills  itself,  I  heard  honourable  Naiwakula 
<br/>mentioned that the development of informal settlements Bill will somehow or the other undermines 
<br/></span><span>the arrangement that the landowners having </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangement with those people who live on 
<br/></span><span>their land. This is complete nonsense. If you read the law and if you stop misleading the Parliament 
<br/>and I hope this is not a reflection of his calibre as a lawyer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  says,  the  development  lease  means  an  agreement  executed  by  TLTB  with  the  lessee  in 
<br/>respect to the iTaukei lands for the purpose of developing the iTaukei land and with the intensive 
<br/>grant  in  the  lessee,  a  lease  of  the  iTaukei  land  for  a  term  not  exceeding  99  years  or  executed  by 
<br/>Director of lands with the lessee in respect to state lands for the person developing the state land with 
<br/>the intention of granting the lessee of lease of a state land for a term not exceeding 99 years.  So, now 
<br/>we  know  what  it  means,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  it  is  an  area  with  the  state  that  has  acquired  the 
<br/>development lease.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only way the iTaukei Land Trust Board can give a development lease to the state if at 
<br/>least 60 per cent of the landowners have confronted to it. So how can it in anyway be doing what 
<br/>honourable Nawaikula is saying?  That is precisely what has happened.  All these areas where people 
<br/>lived in </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangement for 30 years to 50 years, landowners are not getting enough money, 
<br/>it is prime land in some of the places, what we are saying, “we start paying the development lease”.  
<br/>Landowners consent, at least, 60 per cent, yes okay, you can develop this, 60 per cent agree, we then 
<br/></span><span>start paying the development lease on a yearly basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people who are squatting do not pay anything but the landowners get money from us and 
<br/>then we intend to develop that land.  What this particular law does, Sir, is that if it is a State lease or 
<br/>a State has leased the land, then we should be able to ensure that those people who want their lands 
<br/>to be given 99-year leases that they need to move should the need be.  As we all know squatters do 
<br/>not build houses in a straight row, they build all over the place.  How can you develop the road if one 
<br/>gentleman decides not to move his house?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Education will tell you that in Caubati, four or five years is being 
<br/>stuck because three people do not want to move their houses, so the road cannot be built or there is 
<br/>little space between houses, roads cannot be built, how can we have proper development?  The State 
<br/>is paying for it and everyone that lives in the squatter area will be assured of a title, whether it is a 
<br/>strata or land title.  This is precisely what this law does.

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are objecting to the same, in other words the PCN, Lagilagi, those poor people who 
<br/>have paid over $2.2 million should not be reimbursed the funds.  They are saying we should not do 
<br/>that.  That is precisely what they are doing by objecting to this particular Revised Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Saukuru said that the State should pay for all the freight costs.  
<br/>What is he saying?  So when Vinod Patel is going to now import hardware to sell in their shop, we 
<br/>should pay Vinod Patel’s freight; that is what he is saying.  And they talk about giving money to 
<br/>private businesses so when Meghji wants to bring in his liquor, for the freight cost, we should pay – 
<br/>what an absolutely silly proposition.  The Government does not buy those things, the Government 
<br/>does not go and buy wheat – the private companies that buy it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  Bus  Operators  Association  today,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    They  issued  the  statement 
<br/>threatening Government, threatening Fiji to say that we have not done enough in this budget for the 
<br/>bus operators and that services may be affected.  That is why they issued the statement today.  They 
<br/>wanted some special conditions given to them, despite the fact that 20 cents had been removed, they 
<br/>wanted even further reduction for themselves.  It used to happen before, Sir, but what used to happen 
<br/>then was that they would then go and fill up their trucks, cars and sell fuel and then claim it as fuel 
<br/>being used for buses; not all of them, some of them.  Some of the companies are doing well.  You 
<br/></span><span>know exactly how much fuel they use because they actually have fuel tanks in their garages.  But 
<br/></span><span>they  also  do  not  tell  the  public  that  they  can  go  through  the  Fijian  Competition  &amp;  Consumer 
<br/>Commission (FCCC).  In fact, they have a meeting with FCCC next Tuesday, they have asked for 
<br/>fare rise and they will probably get it.  It is an independent process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So we as a Government are trying to ensure that new, transparent systems of Government 
<br/>operate.  Not like previously, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, come and go and see someone, see the Prime 
<br/>Minister, see some Minister and then get their bus fare increase.  The system does not work that way.  
<br/>When FCCC asked them for their accounts, “show us how much money you spent, how much money 
<br/>you spent to buy buses”, half of them do not have their accounts done.  They do not want to reveal 
<br/>it.  How can you run an economy and people do not want to reveal that?  You have to be transparent 
<br/>in that.  This is what the Government needs to do, Sir, this is what the Government needs to deal 
<br/>with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Waqanika I think really needs to do some counselling sessions 
<br/>because she cannot let go of what happened I think 10 years ago.  The cross-carriage licence was put 
<br/>in place subsequently.  To allow ordinary Fijians to watch programmes that were of importance to 
<br/>them, because we had licences or sponsorship  given by one TV company, other people watching 
<br/></span><span>other TVs or they did not have the right aerial could not watch that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  made  no  reference  to  the  cross-carriage  issue.    I  made  reference  to  him  mentioning 
<br/>governance to his speech at USP and the conduct that he did in 2014.  He does not need to talk to me 
<br/>about cross-carriage, I know about cross-carriage.  That is a non-issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sorry, Sir, it is an issue about cross carriage she mentioned 
<br/>it.  The fact of the matter is, that now we have the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform, they all went on about </span><span>Walesi</span><span>
<br/>previously. </span><span>Walesi</span><span> allows even a small TV station like My TV to be available to every Fijian, no 
<br/>matter where they  are.   A TV  like My Television has  very little upfront  capital  investment,  yet, 
<br/>people in Vanua Levu can now watch My TV, people who can catch the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform in Southern 
<br/>Lau, they can watch My TV, it is to allow people arrange the television programme, they can watch 
<br/>the  Hope  Channel  that  is  what  cross  carriage  was  trying  to  facilitate.    But  now  with  the  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>

<div><span>921 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>platform, Mr. Speaker, Sir, soon when time to come, it will be completely irrelevant. She needs to 
<br/>really move around over that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  USP  is  not  the  only  institution  that  provide  tertiary  qualifications  or 
<br/>education facilities in Fiji.  There is FNU, the University of Fiji,  the Corpus Christi, the Monfort 
<br/>Boys Town, the Sangam and various other institutions that Government also fund for this budget, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  way  the  honourable  Member  is  trying  to  make  out  is  because  we 
<br/>suddenly will not have our people educated. The fact is that, they are trying to turn it into political 
<br/>issue.  We  have  always  stated,  Sir,  that  if  these  allegations  are  investigated  by  independent 
<br/>organisation or entity and they come out with the result, we are quite happy to give the grant.  They 
<br/>have talked about good governance in the same breath, we want good governance, we want proper 
<br/>accountability, the Fijian Government is a largest grant given to USP. Over $30 million at one stage, 
<br/>the next grant giver was $2 million; I think was Solomon Islands ($32 million and $2 million). Some 
<br/>of them gave a few hundred thousand dollars and also Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the largest number 
<br/>of students there, all of whom are funded through TELS or Toppers or private funding.  That is the 
<br/>fact  of  the  matter.  So,  please  do  not  try  and  turn  this  into  political  issues  as  they  have  done.  
<br/></span><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  we  all  know  as  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  stated  already  he  is 
<br/></span><span>conflicted, we all know that it is an open secret.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Saukuru mentioned about foreign reserves.  It was a bad 
<br/>thing he said “oh, we have not earned the foreign reserves, it comes from overseas, yes, it is a strategic 
<br/>move, what is wrong with that you should be happy, we have got eight months’ worth of foreign 
<br/>reserves because it puts us in a good place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nadi River Project.  The question I wanted to ask was, what happened 
<br/>when  the  money  was  given  by  the  JICA  in  the  1990s?    The  Leader  of  the  Party  was  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister.  The money went and disappeared. We all know that.  The reason why it has been delayed 
<br/>in COVID-19 was because we are getting engineers from overseas, they come from Japan, people 
<br/>could not travel that is why it was delayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, we have invited honourable Members of the Opposition, since </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> until to 
<br/>date we have said come to the situation room at Level 3 or Level 4 in Ro Lalabalavu House to see 
<br/>where we are building all the schools, what are all the projects? None of them have come, either they 
<br/>were too arrogant or whether they think they will be caught out.  We do not know but we have invited 
<br/></span><span>them and none of them have turned up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr, Speaker, Sir, you see he is saying it is not our job. It is your job to speak the facts with 
<br/>knowledge and that will help you acquire knowledge honourable Kuridrani which you are lack a lot 
<br/>off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the same way, if you talk about the Nadi River Rehabilitation Programme, 
<br/>it is opened. We have had discussions recently with some landowning units, we did a presentation.  
<br/>In fact, the Budget consultation in Nadi  Civic Centre, we had the entire session on the Nadi River 
<br/>Rehabilitation  Project,  Stage  1  will  be  completely  grant  funded  by  the  Japanese,  Stage  2  we  are 
<br/>currently looking at the Australians and some other partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to do more dredging, getting the river deepen. One of the things as we have said we 
<br/>lament every time we go past the river.  If people had started building a river walls many years ago, 
<br/>today we could have completed it all. Not a single river in Fiji has a river wall, you go to Europe, 
<br/>you go to Brisbane all the rivers have river walls but we do not have that.  Of course, it will  cost

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>billions of dollars to get all these river walls but what we can do in the meantime, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>of course, is to be able to dredge to ensure that there is no flooding, to be able to get some commercial 
<br/>activities up these rivers too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua mentioned that people are still waiting.  The people in Monasavu 
<br/>were still waiting for electricity when Monasavu got built.  The Bainimarama-led Government gave 
<br/>them electricity.  The people in  Sigatoka Valley, the Salad Bowl of Fiji,  I was taught  in  primary 
<br/>school, Sigatoka is the Salad Bowl of Fiji - when the salad used to come up the bumpy road all the 
<br/>way up from Nabila and all of those places, up to the highway, up to the market, 30 per cent of the 
<br/>tomatoes had already been damaged.  The Bainimarama Government tarsealed it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We talked about connectivity to Vanua Levu to Viti Levu, it took three hours to travel from 
<br/>Labasa  to  Nabouwalu,  and  today  it  is  tarsealed.    We  have  people  coming  from  Vanua  Levu  on 
<br/>weekends with their cars, you go down to the sea wall, the families there eating McDonalds, and two 
<br/>to three days later they go back.  It is creating local tourism.  People from Viti Levu find it easier to 
<br/>go there.  The Hibiscus Highway, Moto in Ba and they are saying they are waiting for water.  Have 
<br/>they looked at the amount of kilometres of reticulated water system that have been put in the shortest 
<br/>period of time?  Have they looked at the amount of kilometres of electrical overhead cables that had 
<br/></span><span>been laid in such a short period of time?  This is the kind of narrative they are putting up.  They are 
<br/></span><span>not recognising that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at the amount of competition, you can travel between Vanua Levu and Viti Levu for 25 
<br/>bucks today with Interlink and other companies.  Why?  Because the Government reduced the duty 
<br/>on ships.  The number of buses - the bus operators will not tell you about that - zero rated duty when 
<br/>you buy a new bus, 5 per cent.  We used to have 32 per cent, plus to protect one company.  The 
<br/>company is still surviving today and we are getting buses in cheaper rates today.  The same thing 
<br/>with the shipping industry.  It is what you call unlocking the economic potential of the country by 
<br/>looking at structural issues.  They do not look at structural issues and they do not understand structural 
<br/>issues.  As much as honourable Gavoka may disagree, but it is a fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  wanted  to  highlight  very  quickly,  in  respect  of  the  Bill  itself 
<br/>because,  of  course  the  other  Bills  are  part  of  this  particular  process  in  Parliament.    The  Tax 
<br/>Administration  (Revised  Budget  Amendment)  Bill  essentially  seeks  to  simplify  the  process  in 
<br/>relation to the issuance of departure prohibition orders.  The Bill consequently amends section 32G 
<br/>of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Income  Tax  (Revised  Budget  Amendment)  Bill,  again  extends  the 
<br/></span><span>forgiveness provisions up to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023.  Honourable Members, may remember that.  Of 
<br/>course the Value Added Tax (Revised Budget  Amendment) Bill,  as we have mentioned, now we 
<br/>have sugar, flour, rice, canned fish, cooking oil, tea, powdered milk, liquid milk, baby milk, potatoes, 
<br/>onion, garlic, dhal, salt, sanitary pads, soap powder, soap, toilet paper, tooth paste, cooking gas and 
<br/>kerosene, none of them mentioned about cooking gas before.  There is now account for these to give 
<br/>people relief, because we have seen in the past few months an exponential rise in the cost of these.  
<br/>This does not mean that the price of these things will not go up in the next one month, it will.  The 
<br/>way things are trending, but at least people will be paying 9 per cent less - that is what we are saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, there are about 21 non-essential items where the duty will be 
<br/>increased to 15 per cent, because we have to ensure that we get revenue.  We cannot just simply give 
<br/>it away.  So things like air conditioners, dish washers, dryers, electric jugs, electric lawn mowers, 
<br/>electric  stove  and  gas  stove,  hair  dryers,  microwaves,  refrigerators,  freezers,  mobile  phones, 
<br/>televisions,  toasters,  washing  machine,  passenger  vehicles,  heavy  passenger  vehicles  that  used  to 
<br/>have  ECAL,  alcohol,  tobacco,  textile,  clothing,  footwear,  perfume,  jewellery,  watches,  electrical 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>923 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>machinery equipment, stereo system and sound system will go up by 15 per cent, including, of course, 
<br/>professional services like legal fees, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have said to make it a lot more easier, there will not be ECAL that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be around anymore and it makes the taxation system a lot more simpler too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other amendment was the Airport Departure Tax. We have seen a trend 
<br/>now. Honourable Waqanika and honourable Rasova maybe perhaps I can get your attention for this, 
<br/>on Fiji Airways, a lot of people now travel between the USA and Australia and like to stopover in 
<br/>Fiji for a few days. If they stop previously for more than 24 hours they have to pay departure tax.  
<br/>We then change it to three days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular amendment, Sir, we have changed it to four days so they do not have to pay 
<br/>departure tax because if there is a disincentives for them to stop over in Fiji. We want to also capture 
<br/>that market because Fiji Airways offers a good pricing. So, a lot of people may travel from Sydney 
<br/>to Nadi spend four days then go onwards to USA or alternatively from USA to Fiji spend four days 
<br/>and go on to Australia.  So that is what we have actually amended, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Environment Climate Adaptation Levy, of course as we mentioned that 
<br/></span><span>has of course changed now. The ECAL on plastic bags have now been called the plastic bag fee, 
<br/>similarly with the yacht too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual Act as we know, there is a climate adaptation fund and that fund 
<br/>still  continues.  That  fund  needs  to  specifically  spend  on  an  environment  and  climate  adaptation 
<br/>measures.  A certain percentage of the revenue that we get from VAT will go towards this fund  I 
<br/>should say, and under the law has prescribed we have to also publish where all this monies have been 
<br/>spent because we have also donors, Sir, that contribute to this particular trust fund.  So, we have 43 
<br/>villagers that we need to move to higher ground, this actually funds that, it costs money. We actually 
<br/>fully  fund  these  projects.  We  have  already  had  six  villages  move  to  higher  ground  because  of 
<br/>inundation of water or landslides, et cetera. We have got another 43 to do so and this will fund that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also highlighted that the Customs Revised Budget (Amendment) Bill 
<br/>has been amended to cater for the announcements that we have made in respect of the controllers 
<br/>approving persons that authorise economic operators. This is again for compliance purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Customs Tariff Revised Budget Amendment Bill again they all objected 
<br/></span><span>to this particular Revised Budget but we had to do this because if we are on a reduced duty from 40 
<br/></span><span>cents to 20 cents for fuel we have to have this law and they objected to it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  said  we  will  reduce  duty,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  lunchboxes,  water  bottles  that  are  not 
<br/>manufactured locally, zip-locked bags, for example, one of the companies here that makes plastic 
<br/>actually have protection but they do not made zip-lock bags.  Many families want zip-lock bags so 
<br/>the duty has been reduced from that.  Meat patties whether it is pork, beef, chicken, nuggets - all of 
<br/>that, the duty is being brought down to 5 per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Financial Management Revised Budget Amendment, Sir, this revision 
<br/>also takes into account that there are a lot of Trust Fund Accounts within Government that exist.  In 
<br/>fact, some of them go back a long way but the people who supposed to be the beneficiaries no longer 
<br/>exist or no one is claiming the money. So this actually allows those monies to go into Government 
<br/>Consolidated Fund.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  have  talked  about  the  Employment  Relations  Bill  which  is  again 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reducing the number of Paternity days to zero and also the Family Care Leave to zero too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  also  highlighted  in  the  Budget  Address  yesterday,  Sir,  making  a  bit  more  difficult  for 
<br/>people to acquire Fijian citizenship.  They have to become a permanent resident in Fiji for at least 15 
<br/>years before they will be entitled to Fijian citizenship. But we said at the same time, we will make it 
<br/>a bit more liberal for people to be able to  get work permits  and get permanent residency through 
<br/>investment levels that they have to put into Fiji before they can get various experience of permanent 
<br/>residency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  to  ensure  that  the  citizenship  as  you  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  prior  to  2007  the 
<br/>Minister responsible with immigration could actually give somebody citizenship as he or she pleased. 
<br/>It was very subjective. We knew people for example that come to Fiji running way from the law from 
<br/>other countries and got citizenship - it led to corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will remove that discretionary power of the Minister and said five out of ten. We are now 
<br/>saying it is 15 out of 20 which we believe is a good position to be in because we need to ensure that 
<br/>the other countries know that nobody can willy-nilly get Fijian citizenship but at the same time make 
<br/></span><span>a lot more liberal in terms of their ability to work and trade in Fiji, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other amendment is the Surveys Revised Budget Amendment Bill.  At 
<br/>the moment, the survey fees are actually prescribed which makes it very restrictive. So it says if you 
<br/>survey land this is the price that you can charge but some surveyors may actually want to charge less 
<br/>than that.  We want more competition.  So, sometimes you may survey a piece of land that is very 
<br/>small, it may only take one day to do it.  So, why should a person pay $3000?  So, this will actually 
<br/>remove that, so we have a more free-market approach to it and of course anybody that does carteling 
<br/>they will be subject to FCCC laws.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Real Estate Agents again Mr. Speaker, Sir, the commission rates will be determined through 
<br/>a regulation but it makes an amendment to ensure that the Minister responsible for the Real Estate 
<br/>Agents Board who is the Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport will be able to put 
<br/>in a regulation that will be able to have a lower rate or stagnated rate depending on the price of the 
<br/>value of the property and of course this is not necessarily subject to commercial property but more 
<br/>so for residential properties because we want ordinary Fijians not to be forking out so much money 
<br/>for buying or selling of homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Town  Planning:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  we  talked  about  Town  Planning  and  the  scheme 
<br/></span><span>approval  of  the  Scheme  under  the  Act  to  give  authority  to  the  Permanent  Secretary  to  declare 
<br/>modification or alteration of an approved scheme plan under various conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lagilagi Housing Development: we have already talked about that.  There is a separate law 
<br/>for that to ensure there is a particular legal framework so we will be able to pay out money under this 
<br/>particular scheme.  We already have Mr. Speaker, Sir, 3,367 complainants and deposited amount to 
<br/>about $2.2 million.  The law actually specifies what process they need to go through and there will 
<br/>be some regulations put in place to be able to show proof that they actually paid the money.  We do 
<br/>not want people coming from all sorts of areas to say, I did paid but sorry I do not have a receipt.  
<br/>There needs to be a particular process in place because this is actually the taxpayers’ funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other provision is the Medical and Dental Practitioner.  The Revised 
<br/>Budget  Amendment  Bill  again  to  put  in  regulation  just  how  a  person  can  actually  become  a  GP 
<br/>through the Medical and Dental Practitioner Revised Budget Amendment Bill. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>925 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development of Informal Settlement Bill which I have already mentioned Sir, and the Land 
<br/>Transport which facilitates the open taxi rank system and also there was some anomalies regarding 
<br/>carrier operators.  It require the carrier operators to operate only between two points but obviously if 
<br/>I am a carrier operator for example in Labasa, someone may come along and say, look can you take 
<br/>me to Siberia and then when I am in Siberia they might say, ‘All right can you take me now to Nubu’ 
<br/>and from Nubu I may go somewhere else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So the carriers at their level of flexibility which we do not want to do for them too because 
<br/>they do have limited operational activities and similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be some policy 
<br/>and regulatory changes regarding carriers and also those people who have driving schools.  So they 
<br/>do not have to get renewals every year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the laws in fact that have been affected and as you can see Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, these amendments to these laws or the introduction of these laws are critical to be able 
<br/>to give the substance and facilitate the budget announcements that we make.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members were a bit confused in respect of this particular 
<br/>Budget itself.  This is what we call revised figures.  For example, the honourable Bulanauca talked 
<br/></span><span>about Social Welfare, they now know exactly how many recipients they were. The reason why that 
<br/></span><span>number has been reduced because they are anticipating a larger group of people but in fact a lot of 
<br/>them went to the $360.  So we do not need to have an allocation of $5.2 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will see some readjustments that have been made in respect of the Peace Keeping Head 
<br/>and the RFMF and various other areas.  So it is about the entire sum of money that will be sent in 
<br/>this financial year which is from 01 August till 31 July and the reason why we have this is because 
<br/>we have to revise these figures.  So, for example Tourism Fiji, the borders have now opened up, we 
<br/>have allocated a bit more money for them because all the workers, all the staff at Tourism Fiji were 
<br/>on a four day week because of course they are almost tourism activities, so now we have to increase 
<br/>their budget so they can come back to work five days a week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, those are the adjustments that have actually been made and so these figures are the overall 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure for the entire year through this revision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it will be amiss of me as I wish to thank the team at the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy and FRCS. This is not an easy task, they do go around with us also during the consultations.  
<br/>People do not understand this because they think Elections is just around the corner.  Elections can 
<br/></span><span>be held in January 2023.  We have to deliver another Budget for the period beginning 01 August, we 
<br/></span><span>may need to go for another round of consultations in a couple of months’ time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact is Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to do this and the fact is that these people in the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy, in FRCS and various other agencies actually work very hard and they work very long 
<br/>hours.  And I would like to Mr. Speaker, Sir, take this occasion because they have had to deliver 
<br/>revised budgets and have one last year, they have another one now, and they have got another one 
<br/>that they are going to plan for now for July. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank Mr. Speaker, Sir, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Permanent Secretary for Economy, Shiri Gounder 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>New CEO for FRCS, Mark Dixon, he has been a breath of fresh air.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wiliko, Akeneta Temo.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Revenue And Customs, Shalini Kumar, who heads the customs area, Momina Begg, Rahul 
<br/>Goundar, Anasa Matakece, Sherlyn Hassan, Tale Katonibau and these are the people Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, and Tima Rayawa, Faranisese Gavidi and from the climate change division, Nitesh 
<br/>Chand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  these people are actually, if you look at the demographics of these people, 
<br/>most of them are actually below the age of 40 and that is one of the things that we are seeing in the 
<br/>civil  service,  in  manty  of  the  ministries  and  departments.    A  lot  more  young  people  are  coming 
<br/>through, better qualified, highly sought-after. We recently had two or three staff actually poached by 
<br/>UN agencies and various other multilateral agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced in the Budget, Sir, we are also doing a review of the civil service pay structure 
<br/>vis-a-vis scarcity of skill sets and also the retention. There are certain skill sets that are very hard to 
<br/>retain.  Once they get their foreign exposure, once they get the training, once they are within the 
<br/>system, a lot more people want to get them, so we need to be able to retain them within the civil 
<br/>service and so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some of the things that are being done.  We have also, as 
<br/>it has been said, recognised in the Budget, an allocation of over $1 million for those teachers who 
<br/>have  actually  taken  the  initiative  and  got  themselves  qualified,  they  are  now  being  paid  higher 
<br/>salaries, so this has actually been reflected in the Budget, over $1 million for that, so they get paid 
<br/>higher salaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very much looking forward to the Productivity Commission.  
<br/>We need to increase productivity in our country to be able to ensure that people get commensurate 
<br/>salaries.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall as we mentioned, we received very positive feedback.  We would 
<br/>like to thank all the people who participated in that.  We would also like to thank all the ordinary 
<br/>citizens who have shown a lot of tenacity during this particular period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have, as I mentioned yesterday, I did not highlight all the different areas of electrification.  
<br/>Honourable Gavoka highlighted one of those areas.  They are getting there, the black wires are being 
<br/>done.  One of things that used to happen previously was that EFL used to connect the poles, get the 
<br/>main  wires  and  the  Department  of  Energy  did  the  black  wiring,  so  if  there  is  no  connectivity, 
<br/>sometimes black wiring was done before the grid came along or sometimes the grid came along and 
<br/>the black wiring was not done.  Since last year, we have actually changed it, so the entire contract is 
<br/></span><span>awarded to EFL, so they are responsible both for the grid and also the black wiring, so we will not 
<br/></span><span>see particular level of disconnectivity.  These are the changes that are being brought about. I would 
<br/>also like to highlight Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we will be publishing online all the areas that will get 
<br/>connected from now until the end of July to the grid itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  last  but  not  least,  of  course  honourable  Qereqeretabua  mentioned  about 
<br/></span><span>corruption and we will come after you, she actually has forgotten that Fiji has ratified the UNCAC – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="113">Page 113</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>927 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United Nations Convention Against Corruption.  We have FICAC.  Fiji is now part of the peer review 
<br/>programme, Sir, where other countries come and get Fiji to sit on a peer review team that reviews 
<br/>other countries in terms of their compliance with UNCAC. She forgets all this. She is making out as 
<br/>if there is so much corruption in Fiji as a result of this Government.  But we can tell you stories, Sir, 
<br/>where previous governments refused to ratify UNCAC because they did not want to follow certain 
<br/>standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  but  not  least,  a  lot  of  talk  was  about  minimum  wage  and  honourable  Adimaitoga  is 
<br/>absolutely correct, people were plucking out figures from the air, $5, $4, $7 whatever it was.  The 
<br/>fact that we had the unions not participating in this particular process with Dr. Partha, we now have,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a game plan in respect of the implementation of the minimum wage but has 
<br/>been done progressively.  The textile industry in  Fiji  has been very much opposed to  the type of 
<br/>increases that we are proposing because they believe that their industry could be under threat because 
<br/>people could go and get their orders placed in Bangladesh or Vietnam et cetera.  We will see in the 
<br/>Budget that we have allocated funding to the textile clothing footwear council to be able to ensure 
<br/>that they continue to secure those orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also for example given the 200 per cent tax deduction for maternity leave.  Over 95 
<br/></span><span>per cent of all the workers in the textile industry are females.  The hotels also have a large number of 
<br/>females too.  This gives a particular level of relief, comfort and an incentive for them to continue 
<br/>with their businesses.  This is the time of hand holding that is strategically important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted again earlier on, that we simply cannot increase the wages overnight.  Many 
<br/>businesses  will  actually  get  rid  of  jobs,  so  this  is  the  progressive  approach  to  it.    It  ensures  that 
<br/>everyone gets to the mark and gives us one year for us to get to $4 and commensurately increase in 
<br/>the salaries of those who are in the next category of the Ten Wages Sector which is also going to be 
<br/>reviewed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the honourable Members who spoke in favour of 
<br/>the Budget.  I think it is a win for the ordinary Fijians and I think a lot of them appreciate this and 
<br/>we look forward to more of their contribution.  We look forward to more of their participations and 
<br/>consultations that have taken place in the next Budget Sessions that we will have and when we will 
<br/>deliver in the next budget in July of this year.  I would like to thank all the honourable Members for 
<br/>their  contribution  and  indeed  for  everyone  that  has  participated  in  this  particular  scheme  or 
<br/>programme in delivering this Mini-Budget Sir.
