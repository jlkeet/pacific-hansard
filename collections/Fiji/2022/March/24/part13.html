<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted earlier on that we have a 
<br/>Revised Budget that needs to be delivered, and there are various laws that come as part of the Budget 
<br/>Amendment Bills which I will elaborate further on in my address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Mr. Speaker, the motion that we have is coming under Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order 51 and it is restricting the participation of the public or the normal procedure that we usually
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>782  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do to ventilate issues.  In this one specifically, this is relating to this mini budget or supplementary 
<br/>budget.  But, Mr. Speaker, it is laughable and let me just comment on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Economy has  travelled around Fiji  consulting, seeking views 
<br/>from the public but when you look at the purpose of a supplementary budget it is very clear. You can 
<br/>only do so where there is an economic shock that occurs.  So, it is more for the public to ask the 
<br/>Government what is the problem then for the Government to be asking the inputs from the other side. 
<br/>The public want to know what is the shock, what is the problem and I had hoped that the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Economy had outlined to them the problem that we have and how he wishes to through 
<br/>the supplementary budget  address  those. What  kind  of problem? Let  me  just go through some of 
<br/>these problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact that our economic growth has been declining since 2016. The fact that investment is 
<br/>at its lowest level.  The fact that poverty and hardship continue to increase.  The fact that debt stock 
<br/>is at unsustainable level. Unemployment continues to rise.  Importation of food continues to rise and 
<br/>exports is on the decline, et cetera.  That is what the public wish to know and that is what we want to 
<br/>know tonight but it is totally suspicious just listening to some of the Acts that are being tabled tonight. 
<br/>For example, Mr. Speaker, the VAT Amendment Act, the Employment Relations Act, Development 
<br/></span><span>of Informal Settlement and others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The VAT, if it is being reduced, that is not part of an economic shock, that is an electioneering 
<br/>measure.  The Employment  Relations, we suspect  what  they  will do here is  that they will up the 
<br/>minimum  standard.    That  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  purpose  of  a  mini  budget  or  supplementary 
<br/>budget as authorised by the Financial Management Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now coming back to the motion under Standing Order 51, what we are given, we are being 
<br/>denied this being referred to the Committee stage.  So, we will be totally in the dark and that is the 
<br/>reason why we are opposing this because it is unnecessary, it is unethical, it is unprofessional and is 
<br/>totally wrong to bring in this Bill through Standing Order 51.  If you want to ventilate issues, if you 
<br/>want the public to be part of the Parliamentary process, have an announcement tonight, give us a 
<br/>couple of days to digest it and we will come back and debate it and we go through the Committee 
<br/>process. In that way everyone will know, not only us here, but the public will know, but bringing in 
<br/>by Standing Order 51, we are denying that to the public and that is why we are opposing the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing further to add except that 
<br/>the Fijian people are actually waiting for this Mini-Budget. We know the importance of this Mini-
<br/></span><span>Budget and we wish to proceed on this matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
