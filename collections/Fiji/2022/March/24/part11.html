<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Email and Statement by the National Federation Party  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  I  will  now  address  issues  raised  by  the  National  Federation  Party  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regards to the:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unanimous decision of the Business Committee to defer the scheduled 7th to 11th March 
<br/>Sitting to 4th to 8th April; and

<div><span> Speaker’s Ruling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>771   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purported subversion of Parliamentary democracy and ambush of Parliamentary processes. 
<br/>The honourable Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua stated that he had only read the email communication 
<br/>from the Secretariat on the morning of Monday, 28th February, 2022, as he was in Ra all 
<br/>weekend. He then made the following recommendations in his communication: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the agenda for the tabling of the Revised Budget and its debate be tabled at the 
<br/>Business Committee Meeting on 3rd March, 2022;  
<br/>The scheduled sitting of Parliament for 7th to 11th March to remain; and 
<br/>The scheduled Business Committee Meeting for 3rd March to remain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in his communication, the honourable Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua felt that the flying minute 
<br/>was  most  unusual  and  illegal.  He  does  not  provide  any  clarification  on  how  this  was  illegal. 
<br/>Honourable Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua then argued that:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is absolutely no need or urgency to send a flying minute for the sole purpose of tabling 
<br/>and debating a budget when a proper Business Committee has been properly scheduled for 
<br/>3rd March, 2022; and  
<br/>there is no direct bearing of a scheduled meeting of Parliament and a supplementary budget. 
<br/></span><span>A proper sitting of Parliament should not be set aside unless for a very special reason. A 
<br/></span><span>revised budget is not a special reason. Parliament during the height of the COVID-19 crisis 
<br/>cancelled sittings. This is understandable. This removal of the sittings of Parliament in March 
<br/>is unnecessary, uncalled for and illegal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua added that “the Speaker of Parliament and the Secretary-
<br/>General to Parliament should defend Parliament’s interests and independence first and should not 
<br/>have entertained the proposals to set aside the March Parliament Sitting by the Government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He further stated that the Office of the Speaker “should have done to the Government proposal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as it does to issues raised by the Opposition and that was for Tables to disallow it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members should take note of the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Speaker’s Office considers all requests and submissions from all parties in Parliament 
<br/>and individual Members with utmost respect and undertakes due diligence before a decision 
<br/>is  undertaken.  All  Members  should  be  aware  that  when  the  Speaker’s  Office  makes  a 
<br/>decision, it is guided by the Standing Orders, relevant laws, precedence or previous rulings 
<br/></span><span>and  the  Constitution.  The  Speaker’s  Office  also  takes  a  holistic  approach  and  considers 
<br/></span><span>whether an urgent matter brought before Parliament serves the national interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Members are well aware that the Fijian economy is in the recovery stages from 
<br/>the  effects  of the pandemic and we  should  all be  considerate  as Members  of this  august 
<br/>institution that the welfare of all Fijians remains paramount.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government did inform this House, all Members of Parliament present and the nation 
<br/>on  16th  July,  2021  through  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy’s  2021-2022  Budget 
<br/>Address that the Budget would be reviewed after six months. It is already past six months in 
<br/>this financial year, and all Members should have anticipated this. As Speaker, I saw no reason 
<br/>why we should not consider the Government’s proposal for a sitting to review the 2021-2022 
<br/>Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Members, I wish to remind you all that all Backbenchers were furnished with 
<br/>the necessary tools such as high-end smartphones, laptops and mobile internet access to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>772   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure that you successfully perform your functions. It is inexcusable to claim that you have 
<br/>not received communications from the Secretariat on important matters relating to your work 
<br/>as Parliamentarians or that such communications were late.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to inform all honourable Members that a flying minute pertaining to the 
<br/>Revised Budget sittings and deferral of the March sitting to April was communicated to the Business 
<br/>Committee which comprises four Members from the Government, two Members from SODELPA 
<br/>and two Members from the NFP. The Business Committee had three clear days to peruse its contents 
<br/>and provide comments accordingly. No objections were received and following that, the final Order 
<br/>Papers were circulated to all Honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been no subversion of Parliamentary democracy nor an  ambush of Parliamentary 
<br/>processes.  All  honourable  Members  will  be  given  an  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the  debates.  I 
<br/>remind honourable Members that the job of the Opposition to hold the Government to account is not 
<br/>only limited to the budget processes. The Opposition has ample opportunity and space to voice its 
<br/>concerns and undertake oversight work through the various Parliamentary Committees. The Standing 
<br/>Committees  allows  all  Members  from  both  sides  to  ask  critical  questions  and  scrutinise  public 
<br/>expenditures and the raising of revenue in the various implementing agencies of the Government. 
<br/></span><span>Additionally, the Opposition has further opportunity to undertake its oversight role through business 
<br/></span><span>brought to the floor of the House such as debates on motions, petitions, Bills and question time and 
<br/>end of week statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate that the Speaker’s Office and the office of the Secretary-General are here to serve 
<br/>the honourable Members of Parliament. We are also here to ensure that Parliament undertakes its 
<br/>business in a timely and efficient manner. It  would be unbecoming of an Honourable Member to 
<br/>question the integrity and the virtues of how each Parliament meeting or sitting is facilitated. The 
<br/>diligent facilitation of the Parliament sittings is duly undertaken to enable the honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament to undertake their legislative, representative and oversight mandates.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
