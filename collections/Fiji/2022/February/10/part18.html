<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVEW REPORT –  
<br/>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTS 2017-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O'CONNOR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Foreign Affairs Annual Reports 2017 – 2018 and 2018 – 2019 which was tabled on 21</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O'CONNOR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Acting Prime Minister and Attorney 
<br/>General,  honourable  Leader  of  Opposition  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  I  take  this 
<br/>opportunity to speak on the given motion that is before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  stated  reporting  periods,  the  Annual  Reports  captured  Fiji’s  global  leadership  at 
<br/></span><span>various multilateral platforms including Fiji’s successful leadership on Oceans and Climate Change.  
<br/></span><span>This was reflected through its co-presidency with Sweden on the 1</span><span>st</span><span> UN Oceans Conference and also 
<br/>at the 23</span><span>rd</span><span> UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Conference of the Parties which Fiji 
<br/>created  history  in  becoming  the  first  Small  Islands  Developing  State  to  preside  over  these  two 
<br/>important forums. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  commend  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  for 
<br/>continuously managing international relations and diplomacy through the implementation of Fiji’s 
<br/>foreign  policy,  maintaining  and  strengthening  Fiji’s  diplomatic  relationship  and  building  co-
<br/>operation with development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to quote what the UN Secretary-General stated:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Fiji citizens are citizens of the world and Fiji today is an influential country in 
<br/>world affairs which I would say an impact that is out of proportion with the dimension of 
<br/>the country or the number of citizens of its population.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is to show that Fiji continues to punch above its weight, and work towards getting into 
<br/></span><span>more horizons and places for foreign policy work, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to work 
<br/></span><span>towards the dream. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may, I would like to comment from what is 
<br/>outlined on page 31 of the 2017–2018 Report which says that the Ministry admits the major challenge 
<br/>is  to  manage  and  ensure  prudence  financial  management  at  the  foreign  missions  and  the  linkage 
<br/>between the Ministry and the 17 missions is critical.  It goes on to say in the way forward, better 
<br/>coordination between headquarters and each of the 17 diplomatic missions abroad is critical for the 
<br/>effective management of the Ministry’s financial resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is public knowledge that there have been some financial mismanagements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the Embassies and we believe this is where the Commission of Inquiry should be set up to look 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>670 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report-MOFA A/Reports 2017-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>into the way we operate our 17  Missions  overseas.  Setting up a Commission of  Inquiry into the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General, but we believe this one is more deserving than the Attorney-General.  
<br/>We would hope that the time comes that we could setup something like that because it does not look 
<br/>good for Fiji when our people appear in the local courts for mismanaging funds from the foreign 
<br/>embassies.  It is highlighted in the Report and we would like to see that happens, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>to streamline and strengthen the financial management overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SODELPA  notes  there  is  very  little  information  of  the  17  operational 
<br/>missions in 2017-2018.  By 2019, two were closed, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and Brasilia in Brazil. 
<br/>As we know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was first South Africa, then we closed South Africa and moved to 
<br/>Ethiopia. Of course, we had closed Washington DC also, one of the oldest embassies for the country.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA asks the question, what are the reasons that we set up in Brasilia?  Why 
<br/>did we go to South Africa?  Why go to Ethiopia?  In terms of direct linkages to Fiji, we are at a loss 
<br/>to understand the justification to set up embassies in those areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> One that we keep avoiding is  Israel.   Israel has a lot more in common with Fiji, our link 
<br/>through the religions in Fiji, Christianity in particular and of course, the advancements that people 
<br/>have seen in the State of Israel which could benefit Fiji in a big way.  As we have stated before and 
<br/></span><span>I repeat here today, that SODELPA will open an Embassy in Israel and it shall be in Jerusalem.  As 
<br/></span><span>soon as we come to power, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that will happen.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot be moving 
<br/>from  Brasilia  to  South  Africa  to  Ethiopia,  when  the  place  we  should  be  present  is  right  there  in 
<br/>Jerusalem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also ask the questions about our trade relationships.  We still do not believe that we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>doing enough to secure tuna from the MSG to keep our processing plants in Fiji operating.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- We don’t need it now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We have facilities in Fiji that can process about 75,000 metric tonnes 
<br/>of tuna, but we cannot supply all that because we cannot secure the supply from our MSG partners.  
<br/>We believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with better management of our relationship, we can convince our MSG 
<br/>partners, we call them “</span><span>WanTok</span><span>” to supply some of the tuna.  In turn, we give something in return.  
<br/>But it is just the way that FijiFirst manages foreign relations that is limiting our opportunities.  Of 
<br/>course, we know about the USP saga, that does not help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know about the appointment of the General Secretary to the PIF, that does not help.  At 
<br/></span><span>one time, we were denying Solomon Airlines some of the possibilities of serving Fiji, that does not 
<br/></span><span>help.  Even in tourism, there were days we used to have this Bula Fiji Tourism Exchange bringing in 
<br/>the islanders from the Pacific to come to Fiji and showcase their products, FijiFirst put a stop to that.  
<br/>All these things, Mr. Speaker, are important in creating that firm sense of relationship that can help 
<br/>us secure from them what they have in plentiful supply - tuna. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I still cannot believe that the honourable Minister for Fisheries is saying the 
<br/>vessels that used to come to Suva have all gone back to their own ports because it is easier for them 
<br/>to go there than to come here.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Fisheries, 
<br/>does he know the names of all the companies that used to come to Suva? Has he met them? Has he 
<br/>gone to meet them in their offices in Taiwan, Korea, China or whatever? Does he know who they 
<br/>are? The people who can deal with try to find out, why are you going back to your own country when 
<br/>it is easy to come to Suva?  I would challenge him to provide a figure from that information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Fisheries was a tourism person.  He operates some top quality 
<br/>vessels and he knew who will fill up that boat because he had supply chains in Europe, USA, UK, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 671 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia and New Zealand. He knew the names of those people. So, I am asking him, does he know 
<br/>the names of the people and companies who used to come to Suva or not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I do not think he has done enough. Suva needs to bring back all those vessels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, SODELPA will apply itself to bring back those ships and vessels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, there is  much to  be said about  our foreign affairs. We see that it can be 
<br/>handle  better.  What  we  see  here  is  a  lack  of  planning,  very  impulsive  in  where  you  want  to  go, 
<br/>opening embassies.  Very little thoughts process goes into the planning about our foreign relation.  
<br/>This report indicates all that. We would ask the Government to be more careful in the way it manages 
<br/>our relationship with other countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.-  My  apology, Mr. Speaker.   I  want to  make a short 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribution to this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you know I am one of the Members of the Committee from the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this occasion also to wish Adi Litia a speedy recovery at this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am going to pick from the report and I want to make two general observations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Observation on the issue of finance  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When this was brought to the Committee you will be familiar with this situation. At the end 
<br/>of any financial year it is always difficult to reconcile variances on accounts that are maintained by 
<br/>different  Missions  versus  what  is  available  here  in  Fiji  from  the  Ministry.    So  that  has  been 
<br/>highlighted by the Auditor-General and I am pleased to say that even though there are these variances, 
<br/>that it is purely systems related and there is no loss of Government funds  involved through this issue.  
<br/>But,  it  is  something  that  the  Ministry  has  been  working  on  for  a  long  time  and  that  is  what  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have noted in my other intervention, I would hope that this is something they would 
<br/>continue to do because it does not look good when these variances do pop up in the Auditor-General’s 
<br/>Report because it is kind of a mess in how they are recording the funds from the General Ledger and 
<br/>also  the  Accumulated  Bank  Reconciliation  Balances  for  the  Ministry  with  regards  to  Foreign 
<br/>Missions.  That is the point that I would like to raise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one, I will just draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to page 18 of the Committee 
<br/></span><span>Report which talks about challenges of the Ministry and in particular, the geo-political shifts that the 
<br/>Committee had noted on what the Ministry had raised.  I know that we are all anticipating the arrival 
<br/>of the Secretary of State from the United States in the next few days as this being the first time ever 
<br/>the Secretary of State will be visiting our shores. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, there is recognition of why Fiji in its current position is important to the United 
<br/>States and also the geo-politics and the security of the region.  So, he is here even though on a very 
<br/>short visit but it is a visit nevertheless for someone that is important in the US and we should take 
<br/>advantage of that because I think there is a whole lot of discussion and debate going on at the moment 
<br/>happening here in Fiji by people who are interested in the subject of geo-political issues on the matter 
<br/>of China, United States, Australia and how it affects us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I think we are looking at how the world is shifting and we are part of the global community 
<br/>so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does play a significant role in this.  We hope that they use the best 
<br/>of their diplomacy to do what is best for Fiji and its people in terms of dealing particularly with the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MOFA A/Reports 2017-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>major powers of the world which is in the United States and, of course, Australia in the region. That 
<br/>is the extent of my contribution, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you for this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the Ministry 
<br/>of Foreign Affairs Annual Report.  I would like to add to the few issues raised particularly in the 
<br/>Annual Reports here, tabled five years later.  This is the 2017 Report and this is a continuing concern 
<br/>I  suppose  and  it  was  not  tabled  under  2021  while  the  2018-2019  was  again  tabled  in  2021,  both 
<br/>Reports tabled three  years later after they were due as specified under the Financial Management 
<br/>Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, we raise our concerns regarding the auditing of the 2018 COP23 Trust Fund in terms 
<br/>of that Report.  The role of the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) is also important, when we look 
<br/>at the Report the development partners in terms of our Diplomatic Missions and their engagement 
<br/>not only with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but also with the our Civil Society Organisations.  I 
<br/>note  in  particular  their  role  in  international  development  and  their  funding  of  our  CSOs  and  it  is 
<br/>important  that  our  Government  engages  constructively  and  in  a  meaningful  way  with  our  CSOs, 
<br/>instead of engaging in criticism about them as we have heard today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday,  we  heard  honourable  Koya  saying  that  no  one  in  Fiji  is  suffering  like  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition is making it out to be and the CSOs, who are one of our critical actors in terms of not 
<br/>only disaster relief but also poverty alleviation, et cetera, have taken exception to this, one of them 
<br/>who has been criticised today and continuously this week, Shamima Ali of the Fiji Women’s Crisis 
<br/>Centre.  Let me just quote how they have noted their concern about what the Minister said. They 
<br/>stated that he is unaware of the fact that there are Fijian families that have only one meal and in some 
<br/>cases, parents go without food while he is stating that and during the COVID-19 pandemic … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, stick to the …   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- And in a statement which they have stated, Sir, it is insensitive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Stick to the agenda item.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- So, that is what I wanted to raise, Sir, regarding that and that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>related to the activity of the CSOs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Forget about what happened yesterday and about the other day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you. On the Report itself, Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), 
<br/>we recall as mentioned by the honourable Gavoka, the debacle about the issue of the selection of the 
<br/>PIF Secretary-General.  Fiji is the PIF Chair and there is concern about their role as chair on that 
<br/>issue which has also resulted in the Micronesian members of PIF deciding to leave the Forum and 
<br/>that is a really negative legacy regarding our chairmanship of the Forum. Not only there, it has also 
<br/>been  mentioned  in  terms  of  regional  relations,  one  of  our  members  of  the  Council  of  Regional 
<br/>Organisations in the Pacific – USP, the continuous victimisation of USP by this Government, not 
<br/>only the vice chancellor but also the withholding of funds and that is again a continuing issue which 
<br/>continues to undermine the youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Islands  Development  Forum  (PIDF)  had  raised  this  in  the  past  regarding  the 
<br/>continued  funding  of  this  particular  body  because  this  had  been  formed  after  the  coup  of  2006, 
<br/>following Fiji’s expulsion from PIF to rival the Forum but there is no basis for us to continuing to 
<br/>fund this PIDF and there is a need to relook at that, assess so that it is amalgamated or incorporated 
<br/>into the existing regional organisations, such as Pacific Community and the PIDF.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 673 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also note there in the Report the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG).  This again is another 
<br/>important sub-regional organisation, in particular the United Liberation Movement for West Papua 
<br/>is mentioned there.  Sir, we have raised this quite a few times, the plight of the people of West Papua 
<br/>under the rule of Indonesia and Fiji needs to take a more proactive action on this as the PIF Chair 
<br/>and I understand that there is a PIF decision on a mission to Indonesia to inquire into the reported 
<br/>alleged human rights abuses and this continues to be blocked by Indonesia.  So Fiji needs to pursue 
<br/>this in order to address the human rights abuses in West Papua.  Those are some of the issues, Sir, I 
<br/>thought I raise regarding the Report before us and I commend the Report and also thank the Members 
<br/>of the Committee.  Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to correct honourable 
<br/>Gavoka in the reference that he was making with regards to tuna and fisheries.  I had explained to 
<br/>him in  detail  yesterday that  during the last three years, the vessels  that fished in  our waters have 
<br/>found it much cheaper, after loading up their catch because they are almost at the equator for them 
<br/>to return to Taiwan, Korea or China, unload their catch and then slip the vessel, retrofit, refuel, change 
<br/>of crew and then return to the Pacific to continue carrying out the fishing exercise that they normally 
<br/>do.    He  asked  about  if  I  know  the  fishing  companies,  they  are  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries 
<br/>partnership in trying to create the atmosphere so that we can secure raw materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second part is that he is saying that we should get our partnership with the Melanesian 
<br/>Spearhead Group (MSG) because we can secure raw materials from those countries.  Little does he 
<br/>know that FCF Co. Ltd of Taiwan bought Bumble Bee last year.  When FCF Co. Ltd bought Bumble 
<br/>Bee, it is one of the three biggest traders in tuna.  So basically the big refrigeration shed that was 
<br/>recently built is totally loaded to capacity.  There will be a mother ship in Levuka directed by FCF, 
<br/>now running Bumble Bee that comes to Levuka and unload all the catch.  So there is no need for 
<br/>extra raw materials for PAFCO.  Honourable Vosanibola can vouch for that that at the moment the 
<br/>workers in Levuka worked continuously seven days a week with the majority as women.  I encourage 
<br/>honourable Gavoka not to come here and just pull information from thin air and try to say things that 
<br/>are not true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity.  I wish 
<br/>to commend the Committee for the Report before the House and for us as a small country, we really 
<br/>need to manage our relations well, particularly with our friends and partners.  I think, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  what  we  are  seeing  happening  now  in  Fiji  is  definitely  a  manifestation  of  the  strong  cordial 
<br/>relationships that we have with our friends and partners. We are friends to all and enemies to none 
<br/>and we want to maintain that because of our size, capacity and of course for very obvious reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Tikoduadua for his comments.  Definitely that is something we really 
<br/>need to be always alert of and it requires very good diplomacy skills.  Again as a small nation, we do 
<br/>not have much to influence, let alone the region nor globally.  But I think it is the question of our 
<br/>relevance and looking at the report, we have heard it a lot in this august House, this is where Fiji is 
<br/>punching above its own weight.  Although we are small but through our participation in the global 
<br/>environment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that brings a lot of relevance and attracts friends and of course, it is 
<br/>good for us in terms of donors and partners particularly in our development aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We firmly believe in multilateralism.  That is important for us as a small country. We know, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a few years ago there was a lot of discussions in the academic world and of 
<br/>course in the global forum that multilateralism is under threat. Of course we are indeed thankful now 
<br/>with the changes in leadership particularly with the United States, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of course we 
<br/>are looking forward to the Secretary of State’s visit this weekend.  You would recall, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the visit by the Senators a few years back, they assured us and the region that they are here to 
<br/>stay. Of course, that is good news for all us but it is about managing this relations that we have with 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MOFA A/Reports 2017-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all our friends and partners, particularly for us, our belief in multilateralism and that relevance has 
<br/>been shown through our participation in peacekeeping.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  am  indeed  proud  and  thankful  that  we  have  sorted  out  some  of  the  disciplinary  and 
<br/>outstanding  issues  that  we  had  with  the  UN  Headquarters  in  New  York.    Now,  we  are  open  to 
<br/>continue to pledge for more participation and of course for the UN to open up avenues for us so that 
<br/>we can send more of our people and to participate in peacekeeping missions that is good for us.  Our 
<br/>participation as leaders and drivers in the global issues, climate change, small country, Presidency of 
<br/>COP23  and  that  is  the  relevance  that  I  am  talking  about.    We  are  a  small  country  and  of  course 
<br/>together in 2017, the World Ocean Summit that was also held in New York.  Again that is a big issue 
<br/>globally and given that relationship between climate and oceans and of course how it relates to our 
<br/>economies particularly in the region as well.  This is why our leadership and contribution in such 
<br/>global issues is so important for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the nutshell, again, for us we value our relationship with our friends and partners. Again 
<br/>let me just finish on the issues about MSG Trade particular on tuna. I remember very well the trip 
<br/>that we took to Papua New Guinea a few years back.  There were discussions about trade but the 
<br/>Minister for Papua New Guinea was forthright and honest in his contribution and he stated, “of course 
<br/></span><span>we would want to help, but look at the problems that we have in Papua New Guinea.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go to Lae now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have set up because instead of providing the raw 
<br/>materials for other countries, they go and benefit it out of employment and the economic benefits, 
<br/>they wanted to create jobs in PNG itself.  That was the statement that was given to us, it is happening 
<br/>and  it  is  good  see  that  our  Melanesian  brothers  and  sisters  are  very  much  into  this,  and  they  are 
<br/>creating employment for their own people and of course benefiting particularly out of the exports of 
<br/>tuna products. So it is not only about commodities but it is about the products out of the commodities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also along that line as well, may I also say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I know in the discussions 
<br/>that  we  had,  there  are  a  lot  of  discussions  about  MSG  Trade  but  it  is  the  logistics  that  is  a  big 
<br/>nightmare  well.  Because  foreign  vessels,  already  have  their  routes.    For  the  MSG  Trade  to  be 
<br/>successful, one of the major factors that is a hindrance is the logistics because we do not decide how 
<br/>the ship goes from Suva to the other ports, Mr. Speaker, Sit, we want it to go to Port Villa, we want 
<br/>it to go to Honiara, we want it to go to Lae or we want to go to Moresby, but it goes the other way.  
<br/>For MSG trade to be successful, I think the honourable Minister for Trade will vouch for this, we 
<br/>have to sort out our own logistics so that it can work, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Perhaps, that would clarify 
<br/>some of the issues that are raised and of course, that is my contribution to the motion as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  few  comments.    The  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Defence has made some very pertinent points in respect of the Report that is before us 
<br/>in the dynamics that both internationally and in the region and of course, globally speaking.  Sorry, 
<br/>Sir, I was just looking for a quote which I have just lost.  This is a statement made by the UN Secretary 
<br/>General when he was here in 2019 and he said and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Fiji citizens are citizens of the world and Fiji is today an influential country in 
<br/>world affairs, which I would say an impact that is out of proportion with the dimension 
<br/>of the country or the number of citizens of its population.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  that  quite  aptly  captures  how  Fiji  is  performing  globally  and 
<br/>internationally, on the international fora.  As much as the Opposition would like to debunk it.  I think 
<br/>it was precipitated if you look at the Report 2017-2018, we were the first Pacific Island country to 
<br/>become President of the COP process in Germany in 2017- 2018.  We then, of course, were provided 
<br/>the platform for the Pacific Island and Small Development States (PSIDS) leadership.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 675 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as COP 23 Chair, as we included the NDC regional hub in Suva.  A number 
<br/>of initiatives, of course, have come out of it to ensure resilience, et cetera.  We had the first Climate 
<br/>Action Pacific Partnership (CAPP) in Suva in 2017; under our presidency the historic agreement on 
<br/>agriculture  was  launched  aimed  at  helping  nations  like  Fiji,  which  is  now  actually  built  in  to 
<br/>UNFCCC process which is called the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Oceans pathway, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was developed through Fiji’s presidency.  We saw 
<br/>the fruition of it in Glasgow, where now we actually is being mainstreamed in the UNFCCC process 
<br/>and indeed the understanding between the health of the ocean, the nexus between oceans and climate 
<br/>change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of all of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we launched our sovereign green bonds in the 
<br/>London stock exchange and as highlighted earlier on, I think honourable Tikoduadua mentioned this, 
<br/>Secretary Antony Blinken will be here later this week on Saturday for a few hours on his way back 
<br/>from Australia.  The last time I think there was a foreign Secretary here was in early 80s, I think he 
<br/>was called Secretary Schultz who was here then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this of course shows not only the importance of Fiji but may be a 
<br/></span><span>reflection of some of the dynamics at play. We have, of course, had the pleasure of the UN Secretary 
<br/></span><span>General  who  addressed this  Parliament and  we  also  secured the presidency  of the Human Rights 
<br/>Council where Fiji was the first Pacific Island country to do so.  As a result of our presidency, we 
<br/>established the position of a new UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The environment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is critically important for us.  We have a Constitution 
<br/>provision in that respect.  Fiji, of course, has chaired the World Bank’s Small States Forum at the 
<br/>IMF Annual Meetings for the past two or three years.  We also had the chairmanship at the World 
<br/>Bank Meetings too, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, World Bank has established a permanent establishment 
<br/>in  the Pacific, in  Suva, where through their office, $1billion has been channelled to  other Pacific 
<br/>Island countries using the Suva office.  We now have IMF, we have World Bank, we have ADB all 
<br/>headquartered in Suva, Fiji to serve the rest of the Pacific Island countries, and these are no mean 
<br/>feat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course as the Report highlights a number of dignitaries visited Fiji in that 
<br/>period.  In respect of the operational matters, but before that, we have a very good Counsellor in 
<br/></span><span>Israel, Honourable Gavoka, who represent us the Fijian Mission in London as accredited to Israel.  
<br/></span><span>Of course, our High Commissioner in Canberra works very closely with the Israeli High Commission 
<br/>in Canberra and our Prime Minister himself, of course, has a very close working relationship with 
<br/>the Israeli Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, of course, are in Golan Heights also and that a much deeper relationship and lot more 
<br/>practical relationship where Fiji actually does provide a particular form of assistance that perhaps, 
<br/>could not be done between the countries themselves.  They need little countries like Fiji with that 
<br/>level of experience and expertise in peacekeeping that has, of course, further enhanced our reputation 
<br/>not just within the region but outside the region too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the closure of Diplomatic Missions was highlighted.  Again, a number of 
<br/>countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example in USA if you go to New York as you would know a number 
<br/>of the Ambassadors in the UN system are accredited to Washington itself.  Indeed, we have PRUN 
<br/>who is actually will be here tomorrow where we will be meeting with the United States Secretary 
<br/>Antony Blinken.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MOFA A/Reports 2017-2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of course, has aligned its priorities of Government in 
<br/>respect of the National Development Plan and the rationalisation of costs. We have a number of our 
<br/>Missions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that were bought some time back in terms of the asset base itself.  We, 
<br/>of course, had to ensure because of years of neglect in the maintenance, a lot of the properties are 
<br/>deteriorating, so a lot of funding needs to be allocated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am talking from a finance/economic perspective.  For example, our London Mission is in a 
<br/>very prime real estate. The last time the valuation was done, it was worth about FJ$30 million itself, 
<br/>it is just that one property.  But it does need a lot of repairs now because it is a very old building but 
<br/>it  is  in  a  very  prime  part  of  London  near  Kensington  Gardens.    The  idea  is  to  work  a  lot  more 
<br/>efficiently and effectively with far less expenditure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  look  at  a  lot  of  the  Missions  overseas  now  in  other 
<br/>countries, they do not necessarily bring every single staff member from the capital.  That is the old 
<br/>way of doing things.  In particular a country like Fiji is not going to get involved in building a secret 
<br/>submarine or have nuclear arms or weapons that every single person who works in the embassy has 
<br/>to be from the capital.  So, you may have one or two people that may be on the top tier from Fiji (1, 
<br/>2 or 3) but the others should also be locally engaged because our main focus apart from the aspects 
<br/></span><span>such  as  climate  change,  Sir,  is  ensuring  that  we  develop  good  trade  relationships  and  trade 
<br/></span><span>relationships by having a lot more people engaged locally does give us benefit in particular in areas 
<br/>that you want to further your trade relationships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the cross accreditation is equally very important to us.  Yes, those two Missions were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>closed, Honourable Gavoka.  That has happened and we, of course, need to learn from it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is going through a number of changes, getting the right people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the restructure has been taking place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to  make,  I think someone mentioned,  I 
<br/>cannot remember who it was, that we have a case in the Court about alleged misappropriation of 
<br/>funds. That is actually demonstrative of the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not backing 
<br/>down from ensuring there is transparency.  In fact, that particular set of facts or allegations were 
<br/>discovered by the internal audit group of the Ministry of Economy. They do carry out this internal 
<br/>audit work and that was picked up.  Previously a lot of things such as that were swept under the carpet 
<br/>but, of course, it was not picked up. The internal audit team picked it up and, of course, the matter is 
<br/>now before the Court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue about West Papua was raised.  Of course, we are working very 
<br/>closely with MSG, Pacific Islands Forum and the UN, to ensure that we take this matter forward in 
<br/>a way that respects international law.  That is what we need to do because we believe in the rule of 
<br/>law and we believe that it should be maintained internationally as we have our position similarly in 
<br/>the South China Sea, that the international law must apply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  issue,  that  is  not  Fiji’s  doing.  The 
<br/>Micronesian countries have not pulled out and you will soon be glad to see as to what happens in that 
<br/>space.  A lot of work has been done behind the scenes under the leadership of our Chairman who is 
<br/>our Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all in all, I would like to thank those in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
<br/>who have been carrying out the various reforms that have been taking place within the Ministry itself.  
<br/>The re-engineering as to how we view our foreign relations, how we actually work a lot more better 
<br/>and smarter, as we have seen now that a lot of meetings have been attended to virtually and, indeed, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 677 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that could be one of the ways forward too as opposed to, for example, in running very expensive 
<br/>budgets for things that we can actually rationalise too.  I would like to thank the Committee for their 
<br/>observation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I give the floor to the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs and Defence to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion is agreed to.
