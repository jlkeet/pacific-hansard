<h3>FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament 
<br/>on Wednesday, 9th February, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Fiji National University (Amendment) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second to the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr  .Speaker,  Sir,  by  way  of  brief  introduction,  the  Fiji 
<br/>National University Act 2009 established the Fiji National University.  Sir, the needs of those in post-
<br/>secondary education in Fiji, indeed, it provides to be another alternative university.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have discussed the other day it is, in fact, a conglomeration of different existing schools 
<br/>that existed within Fiji, whether it is Agriculture School, the Technical Institute, the Fiji School of 
<br/></span><span>Medicine, the Maritime School, et cetera, and of course, it has now it establish its own schools too 
<br/></span><span>within it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Act  provides  for  the  functions,  powers  and  management  of  the 
<br/>administration of FNU.  More specifically in pertinent to this particular amendment, section 7 of the 
<br/>Act establishes the Council of FNU which is the governing body that exercises the powers conferred 
<br/>on FNU by the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 12 of the Act sets out the membership of the Council. The Council 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consists of official members, appointed members, elected members and co-opted members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 32(d) of the Act specifies that the Permanent Secretary for Education 
<br/>is an ex-official member of the Council, holds office for such time as he or she continues to occupy 
<br/>the position by virtue of which he or she became an official of the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  is  the  agency  responsible  for 
<br/>administering  the  grant  of  FNU,  as  an  off-budget  State  entity  and  to  maintain  FNU’s  true 
<br/>independence as an academic institution, the Fiji National University (Amendment) Bill 2022 seeks 
<br/></span><span>to  amend  the  Act  to  remove  the  PS  for  Education  as  an  ex-officio  member  of  the  Council.    Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, obviously, it does provide that arm’s length dealing in respect of the governance issues 
<br/>that may emanate from time to time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we said in the introduction of the Bill  yesterday that we are doing the similar, sort of, 
<br/>arrangement whether it is provided by law or not provided by law, or there may have been a practice 
<br/>where Permanent Secretaries used to be put on various statutory boards and we are trying to take 
<br/>them out.  For example, in Housing Authority, before  you would see the  Permanent  Secretary for 
<br/>Housing siting in  the Housing Authority  Board.   Sir,  Land Transport Authority, for  example, the 
<br/>Permanent  Secretary  so  we  moved  them  away  because  when  there  are  issues  to  do  with  those 
<br/>particular agencies, we ensure that there is an arm’s length so the Minister, for example, if her or she 
<br/>may feel there needs to be some form of investigation or accountability, then you do not actually 
<br/>have your Permanent Secretary compromise because they are already on the Council or already on 
<br/>the Board. So this is the reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will see the amendment essentially removes 
<br/>the PS for Education from the Council itself.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 642 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  does  not  matter,  Sir,  however,  because  the  Ministry  of  Education  and,  indeed,  other 
<br/>Ministries does have policy input in respect of FNU in terms of the general objectives of Government. 
<br/>So it does mean that there is, of course, input by the line Ministry itself.  Also, we have seen during 
<br/>Budget time that the respective institutions will come along, the Fiji Higher Education Commission 
<br/>will come along, makes submissions and it is good to get an independent assessment also from the 
<br/>Ministry of Education itself. The Ministry of Education when they make budgetary submissions, we 
<br/>sometimes feel that there is of course different views in respect of how Higher Education should be 
<br/>delivered, where should be priorities given, and in this way we get a lot more independent assessment, 
<br/>thus the amendment, Sir.  Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Attorney-General for 
<br/>his explanation.  This is an interesting amendment and I am actually quite pleased that the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General went further and explained the process why Permanent Secretaries should not be 
<br/>sitting  in  other  Boards.    But  for  me,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  amendment  and  the  reference  to 
<br/>background 1.6 is an interesting one and the one that I kind of support very much.  It says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “Given the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts is the agency responsible 
<br/></span><span>for administering the grants of FNU as an off- budget State entity, and to maintain FNU’s 
<br/>true independence as an academic institution, the Fiji National University (Amendment) 
<br/>Bill, 2022 seeks to amend the Act to remove the Permanent Secretary for Education as 
<br/>an </span><span>ex officio</span><span> member of the Council.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  that  is  a  very  important  explanation  with  respect  to  this  Bill,  because  one  of  the 
<br/>fundamental  premise  on  which  universities  are  made  or  function  is  not  only  their  governing 
<br/>independence, but also tied with the governance independence in general is the academic freedom 
<br/>part of the university.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  academic  freedom  refers  to  the  right  of  the  university  to  determine  its 
<br/>educational mission and basically, free from any kind of governmental intervention. Tied with that 
<br/>provision, Mr. Speaker, academics themselves, especially those who teach in the university are given 
<br/>the freedom to inquire into the subject that evokes their interest, that involves their teaching based 
<br/>on the curriculum. In many universities, their curriculum is defined within a particular perimeter, but 
<br/>within  that  perimeter  academics  are  free  to  introduce  subjects  and  ideas  for  the  students.    It  is 
<br/>essentially done to ensure that the freedom for creating innovation and creating new ideas is never 
<br/></span><span>restricted or prohibited in any way by any kind of outside interference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also means, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in many universities around the world, academic freedom 
<br/>also  means  that  academics  ought  to  be  free  to  question  their  own  administrators,  their  governing 
<br/>bodies as well.  I think it is very important.  In Australia and New Zealand as well, governments, 
<br/>State governments, governors appoint members of university’s councils, but, they are left to govern 
<br/>in an independent manner.  It is not about just who sits in the council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This amendment is fine, if there is a direct link, I know at USP in the USP Council, for years 
<br/>we have had Permanent  Secretaries, Ministers, but  that is  a different  architecture, it is  a  regional 
<br/>institution.  University of Fiji is also a private university but Government also provides funding. But, 
<br/>whatever  the  architecture  or  the  ownership  of  the  university  in  any  country,  Mr.  Speaker,  the 
<br/>fundamental principle of the idea of academic freedom and independence is absolutely important.  If 
<br/>this amendment is going to add to that independence, promotion of that kind academic freedom, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, then this is a very good amendment. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji National University (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 643 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just also add to it that it is not always the people who are on the Council.  In the case 
<br/>of FNU, I know people who were there, some very, very good people, internationally recognised in 
<br/>their own field. I cannot say about all of them but obviously in my view overall it is a very good 
<br/>Council with some very good people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, from  that point  of view, Mr. Speaker, it is  very important  but  I think we also  need to 
<br/>ensure that the practice by Governments in terms of giving grants and supporting the University does 
<br/>not in any way influence the governance of the University because what we seem to have here in this 
<br/>University or in this country right now and I have to say this, I think the Government should accept 
<br/>that, that there is an element of fear because when I was in the University, Mr. Speaker, when the 
<br/></span><span>coup</span><span> happened in 2006, and I was there when the coup happened in 1987 I remember the then Vice 
<br/>Chancellor who was an English man. The military entered the campus and basically he asked the 
<br/>military to move out because he felt that he upheld the academic freedom of the University.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2000, the same thing happened. I was the President of the Staff Association at that time. 
<br/>The then Vice Chancellor was pressured by the military to stop the student journalism paper and the 
<br/>coordinator of journalism was the member of the Staff Association and we, Mr, Speaker, put up a 
<br/>very strong opposition to  that kind of censorship, interference to the operation of the University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Academics, Mr. Speaker, all over the world wherever we have dictatorial regimes, wherever 
<br/>we have military coups, some of those people on the other side understand this well, are always under 
<br/>pressure, under threat because in the conduct of the activities they do say things which is not going 
<br/>to  be  necessarily  collectable  to  those  in  power  at  that  time  or  those  who  may  seek  to  restrict  the 
<br/>academic freedom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we in this country have seen that whether it is the 1987, 2000 or 2006 coup, and 
<br/>all governments.  Interim governments born out of the military </span><span>coup</span><span> did that to a certain extent.  I 
<br/>was personal threatened in 1987, 2000 and in 2006 as well for raising our voice against the military 
<br/>coup.  There were many people, Mr. Speaker, who understood the importance of the independence 
<br/>of the University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister is chuckling there but she should know what academic freedom means. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She went through that as well.  So, it is not something to chuckle or laugh about because.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Come to the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am making the point, it is about the Bill.  I am sorry, that is 
<br/></span><span>coming from the Minister for Education.  She does not know that I am actually supporting the Bill.  
<br/>I am saying, “This is a good amendment.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said we have seen people banned from Fiji, Professor Brij Lal 
<br/>for stating his views about the political environment in this country.  The man is dead now and the 
<br/>Government refused to allow us to bring a motion to allow his wife and children to bring his ashes 
<br/>to Fiji, I mean that is just an example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was talking to Professor Wadan Narsey.  He is actually afraid of coming back to Fiji.  Before 
<br/>he went he was actually taken to the police station and questioned about something that he wrote 
<br/>which may not necessarily be what the Government wanted to hear.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I actually 
<br/>support this idea, that whatever happens…   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Fiji National University (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  will  let  the  Acting  Prime  Minister  and  the  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition have their conversation and then I will…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  point  I  want  to  make  is  it  is  absolutely 
<br/>important for anyone in government because if we want our young people to innovate, if we want 
<br/>academics to come to the universities in this country, if we want them to innovate, create new ideas, 
<br/>we must allow that freedom and most academics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, know their responsibility.  You 
<br/>would have one or two odd ones every one, you may go beyond the subject area but what we see in 
<br/>this country today is that academics are afraid of talking about issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How many people from the Universities are writing about government policies in education, 
<br/>government policies on health?    If tomorrow a professor at the Fiji School of Medicine says that 
<br/></span><span>under the Minister for Health, this is not working, that person will be in trouble.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the fear that people have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am telling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Come on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am telling you, it is genuine.  Even people or expatriates who 
<br/>are academics around the universities, they are fearful.  When I ask them, “Why are you not writing 
<br/>about the education curriculum in this country?  Why is it not someone writing a paper about the 
<br/>reforms on education in this country over the last several years?” They are actually scared and that 
<br/>is not good for this country, that is not good for creating new ideas and innovation in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whatever they might say, they must go back and reflect on what is happening in the country 
<br/>because we do not want to leave a legacy, a nation of sheep because what is taught at the university 
<br/>permeates right up to the ground level to the society, the teachers who do their teaching qualifications 
<br/></span><span>in the universities, if they are exposed to an environment where they do not have the freedom, they 
<br/></span><span>do not inquire, that is what they will bring to the students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to look at it right through from primary school.  I remember when were students Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  in  high  school,  there  was  so  much  democracy  around  schools.    I  know  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been making a lot of noise and he moved the motion and I want 
<br/>to  thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  actually  telling  him  and  the  others  that  what  honourable  Pio 
<br/>Tikoduadua said with respect to the process was no disrespect to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  government,  the  way  they  are  bringing  the  Bills  in  this 
<br/>House,  they  are  the  ones  showing  disrespect  to  you  and  they  are  the  ones  who  are  creating  that 
<br/>disrespect for you outside of this House because of the shenanigans that they go through it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just stick to this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I just wanted to thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 645 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Stick to the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well, Mr. Speaker, I am actually being distracted.  I know we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debated a liquor bill, maybe he is under the influence of liquor you know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Stick to the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know my friend honourable Semi Koroilavesau … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …goes to Nawaicoba Hills to enjoy that. Maybe he should go 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there and yell. Sorry, I did not see honourable Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Yes,  because  you  are  talking  too  much,  making 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nonsense of yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I think that comment is absolutely uncalled for. Why are you accusing 
<br/>him  of  being  drunk?    You  should  not  do  that  because  that  is  what  you  did.    That  is  absolutely 
<br/>unparliamentary behaviour on your part.  We tolerate a lot of things in this House, Sir, but calling 
<br/>him what he just did is out of order, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was a light  joke.   In fact,  instead of 
<br/>raising a Point of Order, he should actually go and read Shamima Ali’s response to what he said in 
<br/>Parliament and he will understand where he should be concentrating on instead of talking about this. 
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Sit down!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the former minister and their colleague, Ashneel 
<br/>Sudhakar once in a meeting publically in Ba stated that some of people were instructed to disrupt me 
<br/>when I stood up to talk, so maybe that is what they are doing.  Well, that is what he said publically 
<br/></span><span>in a meeting.  That is what your colleague said, so do not disrupt me when I am making a point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when we talk about Bills of this nature, I get this impression, they behave as if 
<br/>we are only here to oppose.  They call us politicians but they cannot call themselves politicians.  What 
<br/>are they?  They are politicians too.  Our job in the Opposition is not to come here and say how good 
<br/>you people are, how nice you people are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our job, Mr. Speaker, is to come to this Parliament and ask some hard questions.  Even if the 
<br/>questions are conspiratorial, they have to answer.   They need to hear whatever we say because the 
<br/>people are asking us, the people are coming to us, just like they are going to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, even some of these people in the backbench, I think they hear things for 
<br/>the  first  time  from  the  Ministers  because  there  is  no  communication  between  them,  no 
<br/>communication whatsoever.   Maybe in Cabinet, yes, but what about the backbenchers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our job as Opposition, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about a particular Bill, when we put out a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular statement, it gives the Ministers an opportunity to respond to it but the way they respond 
<br/>to it, they get very personal.  When the truth comes out, when it is unpalatable, they become very 
<br/>sensitive and become very personal.  Let us not do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are disrespecting the Speaker.  Only the Speaker will tell 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me to sit down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Keep quiet!  Do not tell me to sit down.  Only the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will tell me when to sit down.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I will sit down myself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for his contribution.  Honourable Member, 
<br/>you said you support the Bill but then you jumped around from here to there to there.  I have come 
<br/>across that tactic before, so those of you who are going to take the floor, just stick to the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  On Bill No. 3 of 2022 on Fiji National 
<br/></span><span>University  (FNU),  it  was  formally  constituted  by  the  Fiji  National  University,  amalgamating  six 
<br/>Government Higher Education Colleges.  Those were the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji School of Medicine which was established in 1885; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji School of Nursing established in 1893; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji College of Advanced Education in 1947; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji College of Agriculture in 1954; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji Institute of Technology in 1963; and the youngest was the Lautoka Teachers College 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was established in 1978. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU is part of Fiji’s history.  FNU is a public university and allocated grants 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from public funds through annual budgets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  2016,  2017,  2021–2022,  FNU  was  operating  on  capital  grants  amounting  to  $367.2 
<br/>million.  Therefore, it is only proper and right that the Permanent Secretary (PS) for Education is a 
<br/>member of the FNU Council, as we see in the Explanatory Note to the Bill and this is part of the 
<br/>background, I will quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“1.5  Section  13(2)</span><span>(d)  </span><span>of  the  Act  specifies  that  the  Permanent  Secretary  responsible  for 
<br/>tertiary education (‘PS for Education’) is an </span><span>ex officio </span><span>official member of the Council 
<br/>who holds office for such time as he or she continues to occupy the position by virtue 
<br/>of which he or she became an official member of the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.6   Given that the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts is the agency responsible for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>administering the grant for FNU as an off-budget State entity… “ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And it goes on to say other things in that particular section.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government, though, is fond of withholding funds and not paying full amount as we saw 
<br/>in the FNU Annual Budget Report which was debated earlier in the week.  We see here from what 
<br/>they have been telling us, this is from the FNU Annual Report 2019, on the non-release of operating 
<br/></span><span>and capital grants.  For example, the final quarter payment of operating grant  - $20.7 million and 
<br/></span><span>capital grant - $7.8 million for fiscal year 2018 – 2019 was not paid on time.

<div><span>The  second  point  that  they  brought  to  that  report  is  that  whilst  the  University’s  baseline 
<br/>operating grant for fiscal year 2019– 2020 was unchanged at $53.1 million, however the capital grant 
<br/>was  reduced  to  $15  million  in  the  2019  June  Budget.    This  loan  payment  forced  difficulties  and 
<br/>hardship on FNU.  For the removal of PS for Education from that University Council, it means that 
<br/>the Fiji Government does not have a high level representative to have a direct input into FNU policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Government does not have direct information on Government’s interest which has 
<br/>given its annual budget to FNU - Government interest in FNU on the staff, students and infrastructure, 
<br/>so they would not have that direct information at this time when the PS is sitting there.  So, FNU will 
<br/>be in a difficult position as the Fiji Government will be giving them the run-around to collect the 
<br/>overdue grant.  At least, if the PS is sitting in the Council, they have direct access to the PS as a 
<br/>member of the FNU Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this particular amendment to this Bill, I was trying to figure out what is 
<br/>really the intent.  The Honourable Attorney-General told us that it is a very simple amendment.  I 
<br/>was trying to figure out the two - intent, the real reason and motive behind the amendment to the 
<br/>FNU  Act.    Is  the  FijiFirst  Government  really  up  to  something?    In  their  own  words,  they  used 
<br/>‘conspiracy’ so maybe there is a conspiracy there, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is dry run before they go after USP, where members of the USP Council are the 
<br/>Minister and PS. So this amendment is very timely and relevant as it is giving enough warning to 
<br/>USP to be aware, to be prepared as they must be up to something.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past two years, the FijiFirst Government has given 
<br/>USP  a  difficult  time.    However,  USP  has  gotten  the  better  of  them  each  time.  So  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government is not yet at peace with USP, as we all know.  The FNU amendment is a dry run before 
<br/>they go after USP.  Once again, they will be up for the match, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  </span><span>Vakaloloma dina

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to contribute very briefly to Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No. 3 that is before the House this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no conceivable reason for this Bill to be hidden from the public and 
<br/>to  be  taken  by  surprise,  simply  to  remove  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Education  from  the  FNU 
<br/>Council.  On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are deeply concerned with the manner in which these 
<br/>Bills are being tabled in the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bills tabled need a carefully review and it should not escalate   under 
<br/></span><span>the guise of Standing Order 51.  This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will affect the fundamental rights and it 
<br/>is an abuse of Parliamentary democracy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the public can have an interest in participating actively and why is it an 
<br/>urgency to pass this Bill and not consult those who are going to be affected? We strongly urge the 
<br/>Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to defer this Bill for wider consultation. As the proposed changes will 
<br/>challenge the commitment to the principle of democracy and good governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although  these  are  the  new  amendment  Bill,  2002  will  streamline  its  operation,  the 
<br/>Government  is  urged  to  give  time  to  those  who  are  going  to  be  responsible,  especially  the 
<br/>stakeholders like the Fiji Teachers Confederation and FNU Management and to hear their views on 
<br/>this proposal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  how  realistic  is  it  to  expect  anyone  to  understand  this  new  law  without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proper consultation? Law making by Standing Order 51 remember the Americans have the stealth

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bomber so probably this Bill is coming as a under Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The public is unaware of the content and the implications of the new laws. People outside 
<br/>Parliament,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  do  not  realise  how  biased  the  Parliamentary  process  is  against  the 
<br/>Opposition  and  it  is  sad  and  it  appears  at  this  day  for  Parliamentary  traditions  and  it  would  be 
<br/>interesting to know how many Bills were enacted through Standing Order 51.  Therefore, on that 
<br/>note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I  rise to speak in support of Bill No. 3/2020 which proposes to amend 
<br/>the FNU Act 2009. The amendment is very simple, it relates to the membership of the Council and 
<br/>that is in relation to the Permanent Secretary who sits in the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the Fiji National University is an independent one with a governing Council 
<br/>as its governance body.  As a higher education institution, FNU falls under the care of the Ministry 
<br/>of Education, Heritage and Arts.  Therefore, it is the Ministry’s duty to ensure that FNU Council 
<br/>carries  out  its  function  with  respect  to  the  responsibilities  and  powers  bestowed  on  the  Council 
<br/>through Fiji National University Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  also  responsible  for  administering  the  grants  of  FNU  on  behalf  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Government.  The amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allows the FNU Council to be independent in its 
<br/>decision making.  Currently, the Permanent Secretary as Government representative on the Council 
<br/>becomes  part  of  all  decisions  made  by  the  Council,  therefore,  it  is  construed  that  Ministry  or 
<br/>Government has agreed to all the actions and decisions of the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to the assessment of performance of FNU, in relation to the 
<br/>grant given, it does not make sense to be the judge of your own work when PS is part of the decision 
<br/>making.    A  truly  independent  Council  will  be  able  to  make  decision  and  be  accountable  for  its 
<br/>performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  also,  matters  of  the  University  from  students  and  public  come  to  the 
<br/>Ministry.  Again to be able to attend to such matters, the Ministry’s independence of the University 
<br/>is imperative.  With the PS on the Council, this independence is not possible.  As the Administrator 
<br/>of  the  Government  grants  to  FNU,  the  Ministry  ideally  should  not  be  part  of  the  Council.    The 
<br/>Ministry’s  role  is  to  ensure  the  grants  provided  is  prudently  used  by  the  University  to  pursue  its 
<br/>mandate.  The Ministry’s role, therefore, is to make FNU accountable for its work and not be part of 
<br/>its governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Bill No. 3 will ensure that FNU operates free of any interference from the 
<br/>Ministry and that the governance of the University is solely the responsibility of the FNU Council, 
<br/>working within Government’s overall tertiary education mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kepa has stated that removing the PS from the FNU Council 
<br/>would simply mean that the Government’s voice will not be heard at Council level or Government’s 
<br/>mandate will not be translated.  There are other mechanisms through which that is possible.  One is 
<br/>through Fiji Higher Education Commission which comes under the Ministry of Education.  We will 
<br/>make sure that the quality  assurance in terms  of courses offered by the  National  University is of 
<br/>national interest.  The other one is through the strategic plan and other policies of FNU will be able 
<br/>to convey Government’s interest.  At the end of the day, we also have to get value for money, and 
<br/>being a National University, Government’s interest needs to be considered for that reason.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kepa’s style of governance, I would say, is outdated.  We need 
<br/>to look at the new governance style and that is why the FNU Council was changed so that we have

<div><span> 649 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>many  skill  sets  on  the  table,  and  now  we  have  very  distinguished  Council  members  at  FNU. 
<br/>Honourable Professor Prasad as usual, 20 minutes was all about himself, what he went through and 
<br/>he talked about academic freedom.  I think all of us sitting here have read articles coming out in the 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> by Dr. Neelesh Gounder.  He expresses his views freely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Only few ones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Now he is saying only few ones.  But what is stopping them not to 
<br/>write?  Is there any legislation that the Government has made which is stopping universities not to 
<br/>express their views freely?  But we can see in the papers that the academics are expressing their views 
<br/>freely. I think honourable Professor Prasad just wanted to create the self-pity, but that is not buying 
<br/>in because we have read those articles from the University lecturers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other concern that I have is in relation to our lectures, just like we expect 
<br/>our  teachers  or  civil  servants  to  be  apolitical,  in  the  same  breath  we  expect  our  lecturers  to  be 
<br/>apolitical but is that really happening?  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally I would say that FNU is Fiji’s 
<br/>own national university and the Government’s priority is to make it a premier dual sector university.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council with its members, this is the Council members, it is their responsibility to achieve 
<br/></span><span>Governments mandate and without the Permanent Secretary on the Council, I am confident that the 
<br/>FNU Council will be able to deliver.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment proposed through Bill No. 3 of 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education for her statement. A number of things were said by the other side, in particular, 
<br/>I will start with a more sort of coherent ones.  Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa talked about a particular 
<br/>Government style and the honourable Minister of Education is correct that, there is an old way of 
<br/>governance. You do not actually have to have someone inside to be able to know what is happening 
<br/>in that particular organisation. The Act itself speaks for itself. And as we said that there is a particular 
<br/>role, it is the line Ministry so it is better not to have the conflict.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  enough  confidence  in  the  Councils  that  we  do  appoint  and  the  individual 
<br/>competencies that exist in the Council and indeed, of course, with the Vice Chancellor. Whoever is 
<br/>the Vice Chancellor will do the right thing and of course there are mechanisms to have that sorted 
<br/>out  should  they  not  to  adhere  to  the  various  values,  principles,  enunciated  and  objectives  of  the 
<br/></span><span>organisation itself.  Honourable Leawere, I cannot remember exactly what he said but you objected 
<br/></span><span>to the Bill. Honourable Gavoka, unfortunately his not here but it will be good a time if he was here 
<br/>because you could see the departure between SODELPA and NFP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad, of course, agreed with the Bill. He as usual went on a little trot 
<br/>of his, the word “I” was banned so many times but, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he did choose to 
<br/>bring in many other subject areas. I think it is really a trend if you observe, honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad when he feels like in a previous session he may not have done well, he will feels like he has 
<br/>to make come back and try and gain some kind of loss ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before lunch I think he felt that and that is why he talked about it.  Unfortunately as usual he 
<br/>tried to in a way cloud over 1987.  I also knew academics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know people like Som</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Prakash who was plummeted and beaten up and there is actually an account for Som Prakash.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, there are many thing that many of us did but we do not 
<br/>go around and fancying about it, telling stories if.  It is not about self-aggrandisement. But I wanted 
<br/>to highlight, he did not obviously talk about that because his new found mate of course is the one 
<br/>who did the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dr. Anirudh Singh, of course, as we know and we have talked about …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, he forgot to mention Dr. Anirudh Singh, one of the most 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>famous case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the word “I” I think is being mentioned again.  It is rather unfortunate that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the deceased, Dr. Brij Lal is being used as a political tool for NFP and by NFP in particular.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have refrained from making comments and notwithstanding the explanation, Sir, that you 
<br/>gave on Monday regarding that particular motion, honourable Professor Prasad again feeling like his 
<br/>lost ground raised it again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I could respond to that, Sir, but I will restrain myself because I do not want to stoop down to 
<br/>that low. This side does not want to stoop down to that level and engage and use a dead person for 
<br/>political gain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He has done and he continues to do that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- And, of course, he is now using Shamima Ali and Ashneel 
<br/>Sudhakar.  If he is using Ashneel Sudhakar as some kind of moral benchmark, I shudder to think 
<br/>what kind of personalities they are going to roll-out in the next few months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is one issue that I wanted to address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of matters have been 
<br/>talked about.  Honourable Leawere mentioned abuse of Parliamentary democracy, there is no abuse 
<br/>of  Parliamentary  democracy.    This  is  a  Parliament  that  is  being  elected  democratically.    We  are 
<br/></span><span>governed by the rules, we are governed by the laws.  There is again the separation of powers which 
<br/></span><span>you had explained quite clearly, Sir, on Monday regarding that particular motion they wanted to bring 
<br/>about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talk about the rule of law, they talk about democracy only when it suits them and for 
<br/>them it is actually become a cliché term rather than a term that actually has a substantive meaning or 
<br/>substantive application.  They are more about the form rather than the actual substance; that is the 
<br/>point of difference, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talk about media freedom, academic freedom.  For them academic freedom means that 
<br/>anyone that criticises the government that means they have academic freedom.  Academic freedom 
<br/>means that an academic can comment on anything whether they support out of Government rolls out 
<br/>20 policies.  If they agree with 10, disagree with 10 that is great.  In fact we have publically lamented 
<br/>that fact that in Fiji not only academics but professional like accountants and lawyers.

<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 651 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not have that culture where they can come out and say, “Look this budget has come 
<br/>out, we agree with 13,579 but we do not agree with these ones because of these reasons.”  What we 
<br/>do find, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the culture, in particular the academics coming out of USP so far is that 
<br/>the leader hook line and sinker support it or hook line and sinker disagree with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As opposed to specifically analysing each policy, specifically analysing each suggestion or 
<br/>idea that has been put forward.  That is what true independence and academic freedom means.  That 
<br/>is what true professional analysis means Mr. Speaker, Sir.  At the moment the culture is there. So, 
<br/>for them when they talk about media freedom, if someone supports what Government has done, they 
<br/>will say, “oh that media organisation is not free.”  When someone is against the government, “oh, 
<br/>there is freedom.”  It does not work that way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is such a slipshod analysis and understanding of it and this is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>think that they are actually undermining these values and principles that are enunciated in these terms 
<br/>because they are using it only for their own political agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I do not really want to go on about it but I think standing here and saying Wadan 
<br/>Narsey is scared, this is hearsay.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that this particular Bill 
<br/></span><span>has  been  brought  about  for  the  reasons  as  has  been  stated  and  it  will  bring  about  much  better 
<br/></span><span>governance and oversight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>NFP obviously agrees with  this particular amendment  and we also  would like to wish the 
<br/>FNU Council all the best and look forward to them producing and getting international accreditation 
<br/>for our national university in creating it a much better academic environment too.
