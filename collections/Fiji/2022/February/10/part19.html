<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Agriculture Bi-Annual

<br/>2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.

<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I, as the Chairperson 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources  and moved the motion, take this opportunity to 
<br/>speak on the motion in regards to the Natural Resources Committee Review Report of the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture Bi-Annual Report for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 which was tabled on 
<br/>22</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2021.

<div><span>satisfactory performance shown during the review period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  would  like  to  shed  some  light  into  the  operations  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Agriculture for the period under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, the Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to ensure accelerated growth of Fiji’s 
<br/>Agriculture  Sector,  product  diversification  and  identify  competitive  advantage  and  opportunities, 
<br/>facilitate public/private sector engagement, promote food security and ensure sustainable livelihood 
<br/>for all Fijians.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2. 
<br/>3. 
<br/>4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To accelerate agricultural product diversification into crops and   livestock products 
<br/>where competitive advantages have been identified; 
<br/>Facilitate private sector development;  
<br/>Promote food security; and  
<br/>Ensure sustainable development in the non-sugar sector.

<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Annual Report demonstrated effective public performance, reporting, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparency and accountability to the people of Fiji, especially farmers, donors and agribusiness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has placed specific emphasis on rehabilitation work that will 
<br/>improve the sector and economy as a whole. This will be the right direction towards achieving food 
<br/>security and nutrition. This Annual Report is aimed at informing all Fijians and stakeholders about 
<br/>the achievements of the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  acknowledges  the  commitment  of  the  former  staff  of  the  Ministry,  the 
<br/>leadership  provided  during  the  years  and  their  contribution  towards  the  accomplishment  of  the 
<br/>Ministry’s achievement on the targeted output areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee considers necessary that the Ministry of Agriculture in Suva 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is implementing a few recommendations put forth by the Committee for implementation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I commend the effort of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources members 
<br/>in the compilation of the Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July,  2016 
<br/>Bi-Annual Report.  My appreciation to the Ministry’s Executives for their timely contribution on the 
<br/></span><span>compilation of the bipartisan Committee Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  those  few  comments,  as  the  Member  moving  the  motion  on    the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committee on Natural Resources Report, I thank you for this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just before I move into the this Report, I am just 
<br/>inquisitive here, where is the honourable Prime Minister ?. Is there an official information about him 
<br/>to this House and to the public?  It is important that we know and understand.  Everyone is praying 
<br/>for  him,  and  we  need  the  information  from  the  Government  itself  as  to  the  status  of  our  Prime 
<br/>Minister.  Is he in New Zealand, or Australia or elsewhere? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, a Point of Order.  I do not  know why the honourable 
<br/>Member  has  suddenly  woken  up.  We  have  probably  made  on  more  than  three  occasions  public 
<br/>statements regarding the honourable Prime Minister. He is asking whether he is in Australia or New 
<br/>Zealand, I do not know where he is living.  We have made three public statements to say that he has 
<br/>gone under a medical procedure, it is in Australia and he is recuperating. Leave him alone! Let him 
<br/></span><span>get better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- But there was no statement in this House, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The point is, many statements outside this House you bring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to this Parliament.  Get real! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  the  statements  regarding  the  Prime  Minister  have 
<br/>been  made  by  the  Acting  Prime  Minister.  Where  he  is,  that  he  is  recuperating,  that  is  common 
<br/>knowledge. So I am not sure about what your point is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.  BULANAUCA.-  The point is,  if he could  make the same statement here in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, so much the better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, my comment on the Report, I thank the Ministry of Agriculture for completing the 
<br/>Report  but  I  have  some  questions  and  comments  on  the  Report  for  improvement  in  the  future, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 679 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly on the organic legislation.  I think they are formulating that, but the sooner the better.  It 
<br/>is  for  everyone  here  in  Fiji  because  we  need  organic  food  and  products  here  in  Fiji  to  boost  our 
<br/>immune system and protect against any pandemic disease that we come across in future, rather than 
<br/>relying on some untested experimental vaccine. It is important to practice organic living and we need 
<br/>to have the organic legislation in place, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there are about 23 archaic regulations still pending.  There are many Bills introduced 
<br/>here and have gone back for redrafting.  Those are from various Ministries during the last four or 
<br/>eight  years, but have not been concluded.  It is important that the Solicitor-General or whoever is 
<br/>delaying the process to fasten it and get those Bills approved in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, under Recommendation no. 3, we need more agriculture land for grazing to open up 
<br/>areas but they need financial, professional, technical and any kind of support from the Government 
<br/>itself, particularly in  the Budget  to  encourage more farmers to  go into grazing and produce more 
<br/>supply of meat here in Fiji and reduce the millions of dollars of imports coming from overseas. Are 
<br/>there any farmers here doing feedlot farming?  I am not too sure.  Mr. Speaker, maybe that can be 
<br/>explained  later.    But  it  is  important  to  motivate  people  to  do  farming  and  to  go  into  commercial 
<br/>farming as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On mechanisation, it is important that we have incentives and monitoring on recommendation 
<br/>four, in growing and in technology.  I think there are some efforts going on there but it needs to be 
<br/>supported more, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Cold storage and transportation as well in the agriculture sector.  
<br/>It is important that they are assisted technically in technology in order to produce more and to export 
<br/>more,  foreign  exchange  more  and  reduce  the  imports  from  overseas.    So,  it  is  also  important  to 
<br/>increase our market outlets and whether we can ask our embassies or trade missions overseas to help 
<br/>us in that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, on Kavanagasau, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need for the farmers there for a cold storage 
<br/>facility but as has been explained by the honourable Minister for Agriculture, there are already cold 
<br/>storage facilities in Sigatoka and elsewhere.  If that is the case, Kavanagasau will need to improve 
<br/>their roads and bridges there because they are normally under water when there is rain or flooding in 
<br/>that area, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is important to improve.  If they do not have the cold storage facility 
<br/>there, they will need to improve their roads to transport their goods and products easily to the cold 
<br/>storage facilities in Sigatoka and most of the time the roads are bad or bridges are under water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> It is important, if there is no cold storage there, this is on the east side of Sigatoka, we are 
<br/></span><span>not talking about the west side of Sigatoka where there is already tarsealed road.  We are talking 
<br/></span><span>about the right side of Sigatoka or the East side of the Sigatoka Valley because Sigatoka Valley is 
<br/>the salad bowl of Fiji so you need to get proper roads and bridges out there to help the products out 
<br/>into the cold storages for marketing and selling. So, it is important to develop cold storage facilities 
<br/>in the various districts which needs power and water as well to uplift the subsistence farming level 
<br/>to commercial level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to encourage our people here in Fiji to go from subsistence to commercial and 
<br/>produce a lot more because I think there are only 40 per cent commercial farmers in Fiji and 60 per 
<br/>cent are subsistence.  So it is important to encourage more of those 60 percent subsistence farmers to 
<br/>do commercial farming and to produce more for the betterment of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On economic performance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would prefer that the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>in their annual report always very properly record their economic performances on just one page.  
<br/>But I would like to give some statistics here which does not make ends meet.  From 2014, 2015 and 
<br/>2016 of which we are currently going through and I also have the figures here 2016-2017 and 2017-
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>

<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018 or future years, we have got the reports here but we have not gone through them.  It is important 
<br/>to note these figures here, Mr. Speaker, Sir and if they are wrong then probably the Ministry or the 
<br/>Minister to go and correct it before we go through the reports for 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the production in  2014  – 294,877 metric tonnes,  2015  – 295,537  metric tonnes  and 
<br/>2016 because only seven months  – 100,162 metric tonnes. 2016-2017 –  which we have not  gone 
<br/>through  is  255,435  metric  tonnes  and  2017-2018,  the  reports  we  have  here  also  records  255,435 
<br/>metric tonnes.  How come the same for 2016-2017 and 2017-2018?   Maybe we can correct that when 
<br/>we do it but I am just highlighting it here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the contribution to GDP, 2014 - $500 million, 2015 - $542 million, 2016 (seven months) 
<br/>- $542 million as well.  Perhaps, if you can check that figure.  It is too much for seven months, I may 
<br/>be wrong but if it can be checked, good.  The year next is 2016 – 2017 which is $500.8 million so it 
<br/>is less than the seven months prior.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017 – 2018 - $500.8 million same again; how can they be the same?  Same for production, 
<br/>same for contribution to GDP again for future years.  Also for export, $180 million in 2014, $198 
<br/>million in 2015 and $224 million in 2016 for seven months is more than the full years of 2014 and 
<br/></span><span>2015.  The future years, 2016 and 2017 came back down to $194 million and same figure of $194 
<br/></span><span>million is reflected in 2017 – 2018; how can they be the same again?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Export is $556 million in 2014, $514 million in 2015 and $717 million in 2016 for seven 
<br/>months, a lot more than the whole years of 2014 and 2015.  In 2016 and 2017, $645 million again, 
<br/>2017 and 2018; same again $645 million, how can that be?  I may be wrong but it needs to be checked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Balance of trade therefore was $376 in 2014, $316 in 2015 and $430 in 2016, (but the figure 
<br/>needs to be checked) and $451 in 2017-2018.  We have not gone through but it needs to be checked 
<br/>and corrected before we go into it later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget increased from $67 million in 2014, $64.9 million in 2015, $48.3 million in 2016, 
<br/>$74.4 million in 2017 and $99.3 million in 2017-2018.  Expenditure increased from $57.1 million to 
<br/>$52.6 million then because of six months it reduced to $26.6 million and increase for the full year to 
<br/>$56.1 million and $87.3 million in 2017-2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to check those figures, if they are correct then good.  These figures are from 
<br/>the Annual Reports. The findings here are drop in production by 20,000 metric tonnes and why is it 
<br/></span><span>the same for the years 2017–2018 and 2018–2019?  It is important to find out, the same figures and 
<br/></span><span>contribution to GDP and export increase, import increase and all those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The failures is the increase of export only for $14 million despite the increase of budget by 
<br/>$37 million and expenditure of $30.4 million and increase in imports of $99 million or $26 million 
<br/>if you go back to 2011, much larger increase to exports.  Increase in balanced trade from $328 million 
<br/>in 2011 to $451 million in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I appreciate what the Ministry of Agriculture has done, the increase of exports, but we need 
<br/>to do more.  It is not enough support for the Ministry and it needs a lot of support financially, legally 
<br/>and  improving  of  their  services,  processes,  systems  and  working  conditions  to  revolutionise 
<br/>production and increase exports, foreign exchange and also reduce our imports as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that we must fully support the Ministry of Agriculture in order to increase our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>production in the foreign exchange and reduce our import subsidies.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  make  a  few 
<br/>comments, brief contributions in support of the motion.  I thank my colleague, honourable Bulanauca 
<br/>for  his  contribution  today.    I  hope  that  the  Ministry  will  take  heed  of  the  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations, I am sure that the recommendations will assist the Ministry in its service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture 2016 Annual Report for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July 
<br/>was referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources on Thursday, 27</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2021 during 
<br/>the sitting of Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for scrutiny.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture is  mandated to ensure accelerated growth of  
<br/>identify  competitive  advantage  and 
<br/>Fiji’s  agriculture  sector,  product  diversification  and 
<br/>opportunities,    facilitate  public  private  sector  arrangement,  promote  food  security  and  ensure 
<br/>sustainable livelihood for all Fijians.  From the outset, Sir, the dated annual report is for six months 
<br/>only and there was not information provided on gender in the annual report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my contribution, I wish to take us down to memory lane to 20th February, 
<br/>2016, striking Fiji at Category 5 intensity, </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> inflicted extensive damage on many islands 
<br/>and killed 44 people, a total of 40,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and approximately 350,000 
<br/></span><span>people, roughly 40 per cent of Fiji’s population was significantly impacted by the storm.   The total 
<br/></span><span>damage  from  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  amounted  to  about  $2.98  billion,  Government  declared  a  State  of 
<br/>Emergency on 20th February, 2016 which remained in place for 60 day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted above, Fiji is highly exposed to natural hazard with cyclones 
<br/>and floods being annual events that damage property and cause long term accumulative economic 
<br/>harm. During </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>the agriculture sector suffered a damage of about $208.5 million which is 
<br/>6.9 per cent of the total and 44,879 farmers were affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Northern  Division  sustained  to  the  tune  of  $93.8  million,  about  46  per  cent,  Western 
<br/>Division had a loss of $52.8 million which is about 25 percent, Central Division was $40.5 million 
<br/>which is 19 per cent and $21.2 million which is 10 percent in the Eastern Division. </span><span>Yaqona</span><span> suffered 
<br/>damages  of  $116  million  which  is  55  percent  of  the  total  agriculture  sector  loss.  For  the  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>
<br/>commodity the loss was equivalent to about to 23 per cent of the standing crop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Agriculture and Fisheries Industries and Micro, Small and Medium-
<br/>Sized Enterprise (MSMEs) are particularly vulnerable to damage caused by natural hazards and a 
<br/>critical source of livelihoods for a large proportion of the population. My point is that it is the role of 
<br/></span><span>Government and in this case the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure that the support structures for the 
<br/></span><span>vulnerable sectors of our economy are well established and accessible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  brings  me  back  to  my  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture on Monday this week on cold storage facility for Sigatoka Valley. For those of us who 
<br/>know Sigatoka Valley, it is on both sides of the banks; the West Bank and the East Bank of Sigatoka 
<br/>and he knew that.  The Minister preferred not to answer my question. When you fail to answer my 
<br/>question honourable Minister you have deliberately ignored the plight of our farmers, from the salad 
<br/>bowl of our nation who are consistently feeding us with fresh vegetables.  Unlike the West Bank, the 
<br/>East Bank of Sigatoka Valley needs the support of Government by improving the road infrastructure 
<br/>and bridges along Kanavagasau Road and establishing a cold storage facility along the East Bank of 
<br/>Sigatoka Valley. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister was correct when he told the farmers from the same 
<br/>area in Nabitu on the 5th October, 2020 and I quote: “Agriculture has become the hope of Fijians 
<br/>since COVID-19 closed down the tourism sector.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  further  acknowledged  the  hard  work  put  in  by 
<br/>farmers, producers and exporters following the 15 per cent increase in volume of agriculture exports 
<br/>of fresh and chilled produce, a quota that was sent to New Zealand, Australia and United States of 
<br/>America in the first six months of that year compared to the same period in 2019.  I now hope that 
<br/>the honourable Minister will take the request from the farmers in the area more seriously and that 
<br/>request was conveyed to the Committee during site visits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second limb of my response is the archaic legislation that needs to be 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The  review  was  assigned  to  Mr.  Julian  Moti,  who  had  achieved  reasonable  amount  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>progress, however, with his untimely passing away in December 2020, the work had stalled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  review  of  the  legal  framework  would  greatly  enhance  and  improve  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture’s service delivery.  I, therefore, call upon the honourable Minister, my colleague, Dr. 
<br/>Reddy, to follow up with the review of these laws.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to just speak very briefly on this motion.  
<br/>I would like to thank the Committee that did the work for year 2016 Annual Report for the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture, a very important sector, and as we all know it was the time of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  I was 
<br/>almost falling off to sleep just listening to the honourable Member just reading from what we have 
<br/>already read.   I thought that he might contribute something original to the debate but anyway, what 
<br/>I am going to say is that agriculture is absolutely essential.  It is essential not only for food security, 
<br/>but also for the economy.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 683 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me speak very briefly in terms of the Recommendation 2, which encourages more people 
<br/>to move towards farming and maintain agricultural land for agriculture.  I would like to say from the 
<br/>point of view of the Ministry of Lands, which has only about 4 percent of the land in Fiji that as a 
<br/>policy from the Ministry of Lands, we try to strongly support agriculture.  If there is an agricultural 
<br/>land already available,  we try to  make it  absolutely sure that that  land is reserved  for  agriculture 
<br/>because we believe that it is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of pressure now on agriculture land, but if you want to grow it for the reasons 
<br/>of food security and for the economy, we need to make sure that we preserve it as much as possible.  
<br/>Within the Ministry of Lands, that has become a policy over a number of years.  I, as the incumbent 
<br/>Minister, have moved along and made sure that we stuck to that particular policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also very strongly advertise agricultural land.  As everyone said, there is a challenge of 
<br/>getting people to come and become commercial farmers, so it is one of the things that we are looking 
<br/>at now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier on, I was very interested to hear the comments made from the other side because early 
<br/>this week, we talked about the guarantee for FDB.  All honourable Members on that side did not 
<br/></span><span>support that.  So when you do not support that guarantee, you are basically saying, “We do not want 
<br/></span><span>the small farmers to be able to get the money they need from FDB.”  That is one of the things that 
<br/>people need in order to grow the agricultural sector.  They need to have access to funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we also looking in terms of agricultural land within the Crown land is 
<br/>to try to make sure that we can give longer termer leases. This is something that I need to discuss 
<br/>with the staff.   Longer term leases so it becomes easier for them to use that as collateral and security 
<br/>to get the kind of money that they need so that they can drive the agricultural sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, those are some of the things that we hope to do from the Ministry of Lands to try to assist, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as we move towards with the target of continuing to grow agriculture. 
<br/>Agriculture has never really dropped.  It just continue to increase over the years but, of course, the 
<br/>service sector has overtaken it over this past few decades or so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I will try and be as brief as possible.   I just want 
<br/>to  thank  the  Committee  and  would  want  to  pick  on  the  Department’s  major  highlights  and 
<br/>achievements mentioned there and how it is linked to Pillar 8 - reducing poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, increase in productivity and production in agriculture is a very important way 
<br/></span><span>to  raise  farmers’  incomes.    It  also  helps  to  reduce  prices.  It  has  a  very  good  multiplier  link  to 
<br/>employment both, in the urban and rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think,  Mr.  Speaker,  just  to  contextualise  why  I  am  labelling  this  point  about  the  role  of 
<br/>agriculture, at least, after the pandemic and how it is going to be absolutely critical in not only shaping 
<br/>the  future  direction  of  the  economy  but  also  helping  us  to  get  out  of  this  economic  decline  and 
<br/>perhaps, remove people out of poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to say that the direction that the Ministry of Agriculture is taking is, indeed, a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>positive one and I would encourage the honourable Minister to pursue that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last poverty report, Mr. Speaker, put poverty at about 30 percent. It was also saying that 
<br/>15 percent to 20 percent are near poverty and after COVID-19 you can imagine, Mr. Speaker, in my 
<br/>assessment would be looking at a figure about 50 percent and that could mean more than 400,000 
<br/>individuals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  adult  equivalent  expenditure  per  week  in  that  report  was  $41.91  cents  per  adult 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>equivalent.  So, Mr. Speaker, if you have two adults and two children in a family, you would be 
<br/>looking at $83.82 adult equivalent family or household income.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you raise the expenditure by 15 percent to 20 percent, you are looking at little over $100 a 
<br/>week  for  an  average  family  size  of  four  with  two  equivalent  adults,  you  are  really  stretching  the 
<br/>family’s ability to look after themselves and to make ends meet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, looking at the report from NGOs and other organisations, I think the poverty 
<br/>situation could be quite serious. We must not take this lightly.  While we focus on other sectors, I 
<br/>think  the  immediate  priority  would  be  for  us  to  rejuvenate,  putting  more  resources  directly  from 
<br/>Government into the agriculture sector because the other factor which is very important, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>is about 62 percent of those living in poverty actually live in the rural areas.  I think the best way to 
<br/>focus on poverty reduction in the rural areas would be to enhance agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know Government has defended itself in the past in saying that we are giving social welfare, 
<br/>we have subsiding, they call it social wage but Mr. Speaker, the most effective way to raise incomes 
<br/>of people in the rural areas and link it to employment both, in the rural and urban areas, is to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that we go big on agriculture.  Even if it means subsidies for increase in production, we must do that 
<br/></span><span>in certain areas because as I have said right now, the poverty situation is very serious, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  From our own personal experiences of people trying to make ends meet both in rural and urban 
<br/>areas,  it  is  quite  dire  and  we  must  not  underestimate  that  this  is  not  politics,  this  is  about  people 
<br/>struggling to put food on the table. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  looking  at  child  deprivation  and  I  was  really  keen  to  hear  the  Minister  for  Social 
<br/>Welfare.  I mean, if you look at the Report, child deprivation items, 92 per cent of the people surveyed 
<br/>said that children need three meals a day.  That was the biggest priority in the report that came out 
<br/>recently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is absolutely vital for Government to re-prioritise, relook at its expenditure and I hope that 
<br/>they will do that in the next Budget.  I know the Acting Prime Minister was talking about inflation 
<br/>and he talked about how the 20 cents tax per litre was put in because the prices were coming down.  
<br/>In fact, it was a wrong policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What he should have done was not to put a tax.  Let the fuel prices come down because fuel 
<br/>inflation, when you raise prices of the fuel in fact it is like blood in the system.  It raises the cost of 
<br/></span><span>everything else.  What happens obviously is, those who import the items, I know there are global 
<br/></span><span>supply chain,  shipping cost have gone up, putting all that into consideration, we should not have put 
<br/>that 20 cents litre tax on fuel because what is happening is when we are moving goods and services, 
<br/>people who eventually consume the product, guys who go into the supermarket, the families will go 
<br/>into the supermarket and pick a packet of dairy product or whatever, they are the people who pay all 
<br/>the costs - VAT, transportation cost, port charges, everything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very important for us domestically to ensure that we do not add to the already exorbitant 
<br/>cost that comes from the global supply.  So it is not always a good idea to just say, “Oh, because it is 
<br/>a worldwide phenomenon, inflation is going up, we cannot do anything here.”  First, we have to build 
<br/>income and see where it is possible to reduce the cost and keep the increase in prices to a level where 
<br/>people can afford it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee for the Report and I also 
<br/>want to say that they focus on Pillar 8 - Reducing Poverty.  It is a very important one for the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 685 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, I think the Ministry is going in the right direction.  There are things that been 
<br/>announced by the Ministry of Agriculture which I think is positive and which is going to add to the 
<br/>increase,  not  only  in  production  but  we  also  need  to  improve  productivity  and  ensure  that  it  is 
<br/>sustainable, so that it is  linked to the export market and also linked to the domestic supply chain 
<br/>which can help to reduce the food prices in urban areas where people are struggling to buy even a 
<br/>local farm product when the supply is constrained.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will try to keep it short.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I would like to thank the Committee for the review of the Annual Report.  The 
<br/>agriculture sector remains the backbone of Fiji’s economy since Independence and its impact cuts 
<br/>across all sectors and individuals in our developing nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The continuous increase in our total population and other factors, such as climate change and 
<br/>rural  urban  migration,  puts  more  pressure  on  farmers  and  key  stakeholders  to  perform  it  in  a 
<br/>sustainable manner than ever before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  furthermore,  I  support  the  agriculture  development  that  will  continue  to 
<br/></span><span>accelerate the process of transforming smallholder farmers to commercial level. A total of 70,991 
<br/></span><span>farming  households  was  recorded  during  the  2020  Fiji  Agriculture  Census,  compared  to  65,000 
<br/>recorded in 2009.   This increase indicates that more people are resorting to agriculture as their source 
<br/>of  livelihood  hence  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  review  and  refine  its  approaches  to  meet  this 
<br/>upsurge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  Ministry  has  embarked  in  an  endeavour  to  ensure  equal  participation  for 
<br/>women in agriculture.  Through the years, it has supported more than 6,000 women across Fiji with 
<br/>planting materials, infrastructure development, capacity building and provisions of farm equipment.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, through ongoing targeted intervention with individuals who need this level of support, 
<br/>we will see an increased rural vitality through a win-win co-operation between these return farmers, 
<br/>the economy and the rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee in its deliberation took note that during the review period, </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span>  had  severely  destroyed  key  crop  commodities,  livestock  and  infrastructure  in  Fiji.    The 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture recorded losses, however, it had to recognise its plans and activities to ensure 
<br/>that the Ministry’s overall strategic goal to increase exports and reduce import and to ensure food 
<br/>security for all Fijians is maintained and achieved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I would like to assure Members of this august House that we 
<br/>need  to  support  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  on  its  contribution  towards  the  overall  GDP  and  its 
<br/>programmes implemented, ensuring that no one is left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee for deliberating on 
<br/>the annual report from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016.  I wanted to let the Members of the House know 
<br/>that the other annual reports up until 2020 is with the Standing Committee so a lot of Members were 
<br/>quite eager to see those annual reports, it is now with them, so we are pretty much up-to-date with 
<br/>the annual reports for the Ministry. The 2020-2021 is at the moment with the auditors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  look  at  the  recommendations  from  the  Committee.  There  is  the 
<br/>recommendation about getting the legislations reviewed as mentioned by honourable Saukuru.  We 
<br/>had a lawyer who was reviewing it but unfortunately he passed away and United Nations Food and 
<br/>Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO) has come on board with a proposal to undertake the review of 
<br/>the 23 legislations, so I want to thank the UNFAO for that.

<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other recommendation is about raising awareness and supporting various 
<br/>agriculture projects.  We are using multiple forums to raise awareness about agriculture participation, 
<br/>agricultural  support  and  importance  of  agriculture,  we  are  undertaking  numerous  trainings  on  a 
<br/>regular basis for young farmers, continuing farmers to new farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an ongoing and I want to assure the House that this is happening at a larger scale. We 
<br/>are also  utilising the technology that  we now have, our  young  generation and also  everyone now 
<br/>pretty much uses online net forums, so that is now widely used and you probably would have noted 
<br/>the new programmes out of the 2020-2021 budget that we announced (nine programmes), all of them 
<br/>was for the first time ever, applications were sought only online forum.  This was to ensure:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The timely submission of the applications. As people entered the data, the real-time data 
<br/>was collected, the applications were received.  
<br/>There used to be complaints that we gave the application to the Nadi office or the Labasa 
<br/>office or Rakiraki office, and where the application is, is it lost or we did not receive 
<br/>feedback. et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So now, with the online system, we get data real-time, there is no issue about losing the data 
<br/></span><span>or  losing  the  application  or  losing  the  proposal.    Recently  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister 
<br/></span><span>announced and then on the 4</span><span>th</span><span> February, about two weeks ago, he made the payment, the transfer of 
<br/>funds for farmers. All those applications, 43,000 applications, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was received online.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, there were farmers who did not have the technology or the know-how so they were 
<br/>asked to visit the nearest agriculture station where they will sit across the table, give out data, read 
<br/>out data and our staff will fill the online software with the data and set the data and runs with the 
<br/>data.  All those 43,000 were online.  If someone says that it is not possible, we are still lagging behind, 
<br/>no and with the rollout of </span><span>Walesi </span><span>platform, data access should not be an issue no matter where you 
<br/>are.  That was the second time we tested online platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The payment system was seamless.  We sat on the 4</span><span>th</span><span> February, the Acting Prime Minister 
<br/>announced it and we made the payment on time.  Processing 43,000 applications is not an easy job 
<br/>and we did it.  I want to thank our Ministry of Agriculture staff, we deployed extra staff from Suva 
<br/>and Nothern Division to Western Division, so that they get on to the field and verify each and every 
<br/>application. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  third,  fourth  and  fifth  recommendations  basically  talk  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commercialising agriculture, export, agriculture and support to agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figure, the total 
<br/>nominal term, total value of agricultural output in 2019 is $1.3 billion.  From 2015-2019, we had on 
<br/>an average 18 per cent annual growth of agriculture in nominal terms.  If I use the 18 per cent annual 
<br/>average growth rate, then today the agricultural value or total production for the agriculture sector is 
<br/>about $1.5 million.  That is not a small figure for a small country like Fiji, the $1.5 million worth of 
<br/>production that take place in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of these Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are exporting close to $106 million.  That is only fresh and 
<br/>chilled.  If I add value added products that we are exporting, it comes to $250 million on an annual 
<br/>basis. If anyone here says that agriculture sector is not growing, I just do not know where they are 
<br/>getting their data from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are couple of things in the growth process that we need to be mindful 
<br/>of.    The  Agriculture  Sectors  Group,  I  noted  honourable  Professor  Biman  Pasad  mentioned  it.    It 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-MOA Bi-Annual Report-1</span><span>st</span><span> January-31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 687 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be sustainable.  The question that arises is, what should we do to ensure that the agriculture 
<br/>growth is sustainable?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable  meaning,  continue  to  have  growth  but  over  some  certain  period  of  time,  the 
<br/>growth rate will decrease.  Look at the developed countries growth rates, economy growth rates is 
<br/>about 1 per cent; they are very happy because they have gone to the plateau.  For our developing 
<br/>country, it is at an increasing rate, so the growth rate should be about 3 per cent, 4 per cent, 6 per cent 
<br/>and 7 per cent so that is why we are having agriculture growth rate on an annual basis of about 18 
<br/>per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is, we need to sustain that growth rate because we still have a 
<br/>lot  of  unutilised  resources  particularly  in  the  case  of  agriculture;  land.    To  make  agriculture 
<br/>sustainable, we in the Ministry of Agriculture are very mindful that we do not want to create any 
<br/>unsustainable sector which will become a problem later on for any government in any economy.  We 
<br/>do not want agriculture sector or agriculture growth should be based or pushed by basically pushing 
<br/>subsidies and grants.  It will become unsustainable, so we are very mindful of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are telling farmers that you must treat agriculture as a business. What we are doing is that, 
<br/></span><span>we are working with the exporters, Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA), middlemen and the 
<br/></span><span>other market players to send market signals to the farmers saying that market is here.  Yesterday, I 
<br/>gave a short interview to  the media saying that  the amount of work done by Fiji  Rice  Limited is 
<br/>enormous in terms of saying the farmers, “we are here to buy all your produce.”  That is what any 
<br/>farmer wants to  hear.    No farmer  would want  to  see that  their hard earned work over 12- month 
<br/>period, at the end when the day comes to realise to liquidate that particular produce, he/she cannot 
<br/>sell it out. So whenever you have a guaranteed market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so we are trying our best to 
<br/>ensure that market is there.  We have clearly identified which are the export crops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think people forgot  about it, is that when you want an 
<br/>agriculture  sector  to  grow,  we  are  saying  that  the  only  way  to  address  poverty  is  to  ensure  that 
<br/>everyone  participates  in  the  growth  process.  If  the  labour  participates  -  high  wage  rates,  farmer 
<br/>participates  -  high  profit,  landowner  participates  –  rent  for  the  unutilised  land,  financial  sector 
<br/>participates - get interest rates.  So, we want to ensure that we have a agriculture sector that grows 
<br/>together with everyone.  That is the way to address poverty and it is a sector which is very inclusive, 
<br/>it is a sector which infiltrates throughout the country.  That is the uniqueness about the agriculture 
<br/>sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir that it takes everyone in the growth process as long as everyone wants to 
<br/>participate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is talk about aging farmers, it is a reality.  We are dealing with that, 
<br/>we  are  supporting  Tutu  Institution  which  is  training  our  young  able-bodied  farmers,  we  are 
<br/>supporting,  we  are  funding  Tutu,  we  are  funding  Navuso  Agriculture  College  of  course  we  are 
<br/>funding entire FNU.  It is a Government university, it is very important and critical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  week  everyone  is  talking  about  FNU,  no  one  mentioned  a  very 
<br/>important aspect of FNU. In mid 1980s I came out of high school and I had to choose where I am 
<br/>going to go. So someone said to me “FIT” - FIT at that time was opening only up to Diploma. So I 
<br/>said “it does not offer Degree?”  So the person said, a lecturer at FIT whom I was trying to get advice, 
<br/>said, “do not worry, we will offer Degree, will be a university very soon.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 1980s, anytime when a student graduates from FIT with a Diploma, 
<br/>the  lecturer  will  say,  “Don’t  worry,  we  will  offer  Degree,  we  will  be  university  very  soon.”    No 
<br/>government had the guts to transform FIT, Advanced College, Agriculture College, LTC  – put all 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these national training institutes together and established a university.  No government had the guts 
<br/>neither did they have the intellect to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was the Foundation Dean in the Business College of FNU and when we 
<br/>started the Degree Programme in 2019 you will not believe this, there was only one Lecture Theatre 
<br/>at the Derrick Campus (MB Hall).  It was over pouring because all the students from so many years 
<br/>with  Diplomas  were looking forward to  come to  FNU because USP were not  giving them  cross-
<br/>credits, they were not treating them well.  They came to FNU to get their Degrees.  They forgot about 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, back to agriculture.  The other aspect  is  that  we did  to  mechanise, very 
<br/>critical and there are a number of issues with regard to non-mechanisation, one is productivity.  A 
<br/>sustainable  agriculture  sector  you  must  raise  productivity,  that  is  a  critical  issue  with  the  sugar 
<br/>industry and I do not want to talk about that now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are doing everything to ensure 
<br/>to  raise  productivity  and  efficiency  and  in  that  way  will  ensure  that  the  margins  are  high  in  the 
<br/>agriculture sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to assure this House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got the agriculture sector in the right 
<br/></span><span>direction and with the support of the Minister for Economy in critical areas, for the first time ever 
<br/></span><span>despite such financial crunch, we have got a separate allocation to give out equity.  So we take the 
<br/>farmers to FDB and say, “here you take loan for your major capital and investment, and we will give 
<br/>you 20 per cent as grant.”  Why, because that will contribute towards mechanisation and hard-core 
<br/>investment in the agriculture sector. Mr. Speaker Sir, we have got the agriculture sector in the right 
<br/>direction to be sustainable, productive and apart from food security, we will feed the entire country 
<br/>and continue to export at an increasing rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I do not really have much to say, the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Agriculture and the others have summarised that well. The only point I want to pick up on is that 
<br/>the  recommendation  by  the  Committee,  both  in  this  one  and  the  subsequent  recommendation  for 
<br/>Forestry is that, they are saying for the Ministry to employ a legal officer, who in consultation with 
<br/>the desk officer and the Office of the Solicitor-General ,will be responsible for reviewing and fast-
<br/>tracking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Normally, for this kind of laws, you do not employ a legal officer, legal officers’ minimum 
<br/>skills sets.  What they normally do is they bring in a consultant who is an expert, for example, in that 
<br/>specific area of law, for example, agriculture, forestry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There used to be some years back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the different Ministries had legal officers, 
<br/>but the problem was, a lot of them were junior officers.   Some of their opinions they would give, in 
<br/>fact, were not correct necessarily, or they will send it back to the Office of the Solicitor-General.  So, 
<br/>now it is all in the Office of the Solicitor-General, and they have lawyers who are responsible to each 
<br/>of the Ministries.  In that way, they are able to also liaise with the seniors above them to give the best 
<br/>advice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, specifically, as we have done in some of the other Ministries, Sir, the Ministries 
<br/>will  hire  consultants,  following  consultations  with  the  Solicitor-General,  and  hire  the  best  person 
<br/>with all the skill sets to do a project regarding the review of the legislation, as opposed to employing 
<br/>a legal officer.
