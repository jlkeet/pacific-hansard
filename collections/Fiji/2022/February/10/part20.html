<h3>REVIEW REPORT - PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON THEMANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON THE  
<br/>MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Performance  Audit  on  the 
<br/>Management of Environment Impact Assessment which was tabled on 21</span><span>st</span><span> September, 
<br/>2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, land use planning and development are important 
<br/>for meeting the changing needs of the growing population in Fiji.  The impacts of development on 
<br/>the environment are critical considerations in planning and development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji establishes provisions for environmental rights 
<br/>for every ordinary citizens in Fiji.  The preamble to the Constitution also states Fiji’s commitment to 
<br/>social  and  economic  wellbeing,  safeguarding  the  nation’s  environment.    Furthermore,  one  of  the 
<br/>values of the Republic of Fiji is to commit to a prudent, efficient and sustainable relationship with 
<br/>nature and the Constitution confers the authority to make laws to the Parliament of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Environment Management Act 2005 is an Act for the protection of natural resources, the 
<br/>control  and  management  of  development,  waste  management,  pollution  and  control,  the 
<br/>establishment of a national environment council, and other related matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  reviewed  the  Auditor-
<br/>General’s methodology by assessing the Department of Environment’s records and advice provided, 
<br/></span><span>interviews  with  the  relevant  EIA  officers  and  issued  questionnaires  and  projects  undertaken  by 
<br/></span><span>developers that required EIA decisions for the period 2006 to 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee scrutinised the three main key focused areas of the audit and these includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Legal Framework, Policies and Planning. 
<br/>Screening, Processing and Review Decisions. 
<br/>Post-EIA Approval and Monitoring of EIA Conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  of  Environment  is  governed  by  the  Environment 
<br/>Management Act 2005.  The Act stipulates provisions in Part 4 that are related to the EIA process. 
<br/>The audit noted that the assessment of legislation revealed that key substantive provisions have been 
<br/>implemented through enactment of the Environment Management (EIA Process) Regulations 2007.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Department of Environment did not fully implement some key 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provisions for EIA as per the Environment Management Act 2005. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  in  Fiji  is  governed  by  Part  4  of  the  Environment 
<br/>Management  Act.    However,  the  audit  noted  that  more  work  is  needed  to  be  done  in  terms  of 
<br/>implementing the requirements of section 27(4)(b) of the Act, which require the approving authorities 
<br/>to make the decision on whether or not an EIA will be needed for those developments that qualify 
<br/>under Schedule 2 and Part 2 of the Act, such as a proposal: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that  requires  processing  only  because  it  could  endanger  or  degrade  public  health  or 
<br/>sanitation; 
<br/>that requires processing only because it could harm or destroy important cultural resources 
<br/>including but not limited to, archaeological sites, cemeteries, historic sites and landmarks; 
<br/>for a residential subdivision if not more than 10 lots; 
<br/>for civic or community development; 
<br/>for general commercial development; and 
<br/>for general industrial development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  noted  that  the  EIA  Unit  within  the  Department  of 
<br/>Environment has not developed a risk management policy that clearly define the roles of management 
<br/>and any internal audit function.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  was  informed  that  the  Department  is  in  the  process  of 
<br/>finalising the Risk Management Policy (RMP) for administration of risks. This document will be 
<br/>finalised by mid-June 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry advised that the Risk Associate with EIA processing and Management Action 
<br/>Plan is being finalised. The Ministry advised that the SOPs are regularly reviewed for any potential 
<br/>gaps both, in the interest of the process integrity and customer service excellence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the proper management of delegations of responsibilities to assist in ensuring 
<br/>that  decision  to  invoke  regulatory  powers  are  lawful  and  exercised  in  accordance  with  the 
<br/>requirements determined by the delegated authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit revealed that while the job description defined key responsibilities of each officer, 
<br/>review of the EIA Unit’s Individual Work Plan noted that the performance measures of the EIA Unit 
<br/>and Department of Environment is not clearly defined to ensure that individual targets are accurately 
<br/>identified and measured against.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was informed that all EIA officers have an Individual Work Plan in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also reports on the progress made to the Ministry of Economy on a quarterly basis</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Department  of  Environment  is  an  EIA  regulator  and  issues  approvals  to 
<br/>project  developers  to  commence  with  development.  The  audit  noted  that  there  was  no  policy  or 
<br/>framework to prevent and detect actual, potential and perceived conflict of interest. EIA officers are 
<br/>also exposed to the risk of bribery from developers, who may find the EIA process a hindrance to 
<br/>their projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  was  informed  that  the  Department  and  EIA  Unit  has  a 
<br/></span><span>Conflict of Interest Declaration Form and the Regulatory Risk Policy which will be included under 
<br/>the Ministry’s Risk Management Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Environment highlighted that the checklists were created 
<br/></span><span>to help the developers to ensure that they submit the required supporting documents with the EIA 
<br/></span><span>screening applications. The audit highlighted that the reason some of the files did not have the EIA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 691 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>screening checklist was because those were enforced in the year 2018, therefore, the older files do 
<br/>not have the checklists.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was advised that the Department continues to undertake counter check on all 
<br/>applications  using  the  counter  vetting  checklists.  Most  EIA  reports  reviewed  during  audit  were 
<br/>prepared by accredited EIA consultants. However, there were instances of development proposals 
<br/>whereby the EIA reports were prepared by non-accredited EIA consultants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  findings  indicate  that  the  internal  work  process  of  Environment  Officers  needs  to  be 
<br/>strengthened to ensure that accountability of the work carried out by EIA consultants is maintained. 
<br/>Strict monitoring of consultants will result in better service delivery, which adds credibility to the 
<br/>whole EIA process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  committee  for  project  development  proposals  is  responsible for  independently 
<br/>reviewing the reports prepared by EIA consultants. Members of the committee include professionals 
<br/>from specialized fields of study, depending on the type of developments being proposed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Director of Environment appoints members of the review committee.  The Committee 
<br/></span><span>was informed that the Department has developed a review report template and it is being used by the 
<br/></span><span>EIA Officers.  All review reports are kept-in-file and are entered into EIA register. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was informed that within the past four years, Environment Officers who were 
<br/>trained  in  the  area  of  investigation,  environment  management  planning,  prosecution  and 
<br/>investigations, EIA processing and environmental safeguards. Staff trained are directly involved in 
<br/>the EIA process and holding entry, medium and senior level positions in the EIA Unit within the 
<br/>Department of Environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  note  that  programmes  on  monitoring  can  be  further 
<br/>strengthened  for  planning  and  implementing  of  post  EIA  approval  conditions.  A  comprehensive 
<br/>system needs to be in place to monitor approval conditions, as the Department only monitors those 
<br/>developments where complaints are received from the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit highlighted that it indicates inconsistency in monitoring of approval conditions by 
<br/>the Department of Environment. Although some monitoring is done by the Department, strategies 
<br/>needed to be in place to guide compliance monitoring, inspection and reporting of EIA approved 
<br/>developments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was informed that the Department is constantly 
<br/>carrying out monitoring works and through these monitoring work, it was revealed that a number of 
<br/>companies were non-compliant. The Ministry is currently working with other line Ministries and the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force to strengthen the Ministry’s compliance and monitoring work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Committee  notes  that  the  Department  of  Environment  collaborates 
<br/>efforts within the Department of Town and Country Planning as one of the approving authority in 
<br/>enforcing  legislative  requirements.    However,  this  collaboration  should  be  extended  to  other 
<br/>approving authorities, such as Town and City Councils, Department of Lands &amp; Mineral Resources, 
<br/>Department of Forests and i-Taukei Land Trust Board in order to gain effective service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department  has  focused  on  the  improvement  of  its  internal  processes  through  the 
<br/>introduction of operating procedures on the EIA process.  It is important to note that it also requires 
<br/>mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the  administration  of  the  EIA  Unit  supports  sound  governance 
<br/>arrangements to fulfil its responsibilities and be accountable for its decisions and actions.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  legislative  and  organisational  requirements  ensure  that  the  EIA  Unit  provides 
<br/>evidence-based information and advice to the Director of Environment on projects that are subject to 
<br/>EIA.    In  view  of  this,  the  Department  needs  to  strengthen  its  internal  EIA  processes  to  avoid 
<br/>inconsistencies in managing evidence-based information and oversee the implementation of approval 
<br/>conditions  for  projects  by  monitoring,  documenting  and  provide  reports  on  the  current  level  of 
<br/>compliance with conditions for approval of development projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I as the Member moving the motion, I thank you for this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise as a Member of the Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee to speak in support of the motion debated before the House, but before I speak on the 
<br/>contents of the Report, I seek your leave to take this time to convey our best wishes to the Drua Team 
<br/>in their first trial game against the Rebels in Melbourne this evening at 7.00 p.m.  All the best to the 
<br/>Drua Rugby Team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  convey  our  best  wishes  to  the  meeting  of  the  </span><span>Qase  Levu</span><span>  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tuirara Levu</span><span> currently convening at the Centenary Church in Suva today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise my concern on the way the Auditor-General of Fiji, 
<br/>Mr. Ajay Nand, has ended his tenure in Office on 14</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2022 as reported in the news.  What 
<br/>I  would  like  to  say  regarding  Mr.  Ajay  Nand  is  that,  he  has  displayed  his  professionalism  and 
<br/>character by withdrawing his re-application because his actions will be done by any right thinking 
<br/>person whose work has been continually questioned by the Government in the public space. In other 
<br/>words,  what  would  you  expect  a  professional  person  like  that  to  do?    I  also  intend  to  request 
<br/>Government to at least advise us and update this House who is currently acting in the position of the 
<br/>Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  has  become  Government’s  agenda  to  constantly  question  the  Auditor-General  who 
<br/>constantly carries out his role in a professional and independent manner.  With the kind of resistance 
<br/>being displayed by Government, we will run the risk of having to put up with puppets and yes man 
<br/>who will assume positions of authority to simply sink to their tune of their masters; a bit of lack of 
<br/>impartiality will arise out of there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will no longer have people of character and those with a moral compass to lead and be 
<br/></span><span>honest  with  their  work  even  if  it  means  they  lose  their  livelihoods  in  a  COVID-19  pandemic 
<br/></span><span>environment like we have in Fiji and around the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government and leaders 
<br/>must learn not to shoot the messenger but to do what is right by correcting the anomalies when they 
<br/>are identified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also take this time to thank the Auditor-General for the Report that had been undertaken 
<br/>regarding the impact of environmental assessment. We have noted that the purpose of the Audit was 
<br/>due to the growing concerns on the usage of natural resources in Fiji and the need for development 
<br/>to be carried out with due consideration for the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  encompasses  all  the  issues  that  have  been 
<br/>highlighted  in  the  Report.  I  would  like  to  speak  on  a  few  of  the  recommendations.  On 
<br/>recommendation one which highlights that the Ministry says that their risk management policy with 
<br/>other environmental officers in other Ministries and other relevant stakeholders.  It is imperative that 
<br/>this side of the House has often pointed out in the august House, the right hand must know the left 
<br/>hand is doing and also vice versa. It  has become that that whilst we champion environmental change,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 693 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mitigation  and  adaptation  globally  given  the  risk  factors  associated  with  climate  changes  for 
<br/>Government departments – they remain working in isolation from other government departments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sharing of risk management policies must be driven and imparted by Government as this 
<br/>will form the basis of harnessing environmental action plans. Developments have been hampered 
<br/>because  line  ministries  have  different  policies  as  highlighted  in  this  Report  which  can  result  in 
<br/>investors    being  confused  and  targeted  for  breaches  when  in  fact,  it  is  evident  that  Government 
<br/>policies are outdated and not conclusive to allow departments as pointed out by OAG’s Report to 
<br/>have an coordinated effort to carry out Environmental Impact Assessments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently we have cases in Courts against foreign investors for breaches of the Environmental 
<br/>Act when carrying out developments. We would not have known of these developments, destructions 
<br/>had the overseas media not highlighted this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So we commend the work of our Auditor-General for highlighting these issues as the Ministry 
<br/>of Waterways, Environment have become a separate line Ministry and therefore, it is only proper 
<br/>that  they  have  the  right  resources  and  right  people  to  lead  this  very  crucial  work.  This  is  such  a 
<br/>technical area and no doubt and it is advisable that Government puts in place people who are qualified 
<br/></span><span>and have the necessary experience and work background and have the necessary experience and work 
<br/></span><span>background to be part of this very important work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  developments  in  Fiji  remains  under  the  spotlight  because  proper 
<br/>Environmental Impact Assessments were not conducted and the OAG had suggested that conflict of 
<br/>interest (which is also addressed in one of the recommendations) by decision-makers in the EIA Unit 
<br/>can  result  in  the  negligent  overlook  for  this  crucial  phase  of  development.    The  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee has encouraged that policies must be set up by Government to drive a common policy 
<br/>implementation plan rather than various isolated actions by respective shareholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also highlighted that the managing of conflict of interest and fraud in the EIA 
<br/>Unit whereby the EIA officers are usually unaccompanied when conducting inspections and this can 
<br/>raise the risk of corruption and bribery  by investors and developers who  wish to  bypass  the EIA 
<br/>processes  because  of  its  stringent  requirements,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  same  can  be  said  of  line 
<br/>ministries who conduct developments by determining the due diligence processes themselves without 
<br/>prior consultations with the relevant EIA Unit of the Ministry of the Waterways and Environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, definitely there is a need to have a standard reporting template as being 
<br/></span><span>alluded to by the honourable Chair and some line of checks and balances to ensure separation of 
<br/></span><span>powers when processing EIA requests, so as long as the process does not become another lengthy 
<br/>hog that investors and developers have to go through and the trick here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is efficiency 
<br/>and accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  in  summary  the  Department  of  Environment  needs  to  properly  resource  and  equip  its 
<br/>operations whilst at the same time explore the process of decentralisation.  Decentralising its offices 
<br/>throughout the four divisions and this will ensure ease of accessibility and service delivery, not to 
<br/>mention allow crucial monitoring of development projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is accepted that currently because of the nature of work, line ministries, town councils and 
<br/>other  stakeholders  carry  out  their  own  EIA  assessments  through  their  EIA  units.  What  is  highly 
<br/>recommended is that these works in sync with the Department of Environment so that there are no 
<br/>overlaps and gaps in implementation of crucial processes for development purposes?

<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot be ignoring our responsibilities at home whilst we champion the 
<br/>global  targets  for  the  reduction  of  climate  impacts  and  environmental  degradation  when  our  own 
<br/>policies at home need better coordination for the benefit of sustainable development of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And we also request the OAG to give an update and conduct another audit of the Ministry to 
<br/>see  how  the  Ministry  has  progressed  against  the  recommendations  that  they  have  and  what  the 
<br/>Committee have put out in our Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, I once again would like to take this time to 
<br/>pay tribute to Mr. Ajay Nand, the former Auditor-General, who I see from media reports completed 
<br/>his  term  on  14</span><span>th</span><span>  January  and  whose  report  we  are  examining  now  which  is  the  review  of  the 
<br/>performance audit on the management of EIA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, now means that there are two key constitutional offices vacant.  This one 
<br/>as  well  as  the  chair  of  the  Electoral  Commission  which  is  oddly  still  vacant  two  months  into  an 
<br/>election year.  This performance audit of the EIA as carried out by the OAG is quite a comprehensive 
<br/>and systematic piece of work and my commendation to the team at the Office of the Auditor General 
<br/>who did this for Parliament noting also that they tabled it to us two years ago.  But it is alarming 
<br/></span><span>when  one  realises  that  having  Auditor-General’s  Office  not  done  this  report,  the  laxities, 
<br/></span><span>inefficiencies and possible conflict of interest under the Minister, his Permanent Secretary and the 
<br/>Director of Environment own eyes would not have been realised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to ask the honourable Minister, what are you doing?  What are the taxpayers paying 
<br/>you for, Mr. Minister?  No wonder the Malolo saga exposed and embarrassed the Government like 
<br/>it did.  That is the reason, why I intend to focus on recommendation 6 of the Auditor-General’s audit 
<br/>and recommendation 7 of the Committee’s report on the issue of conflict of interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even if the mere perception of conflict of interest in the regulation because even the mere 
<br/>perception  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  regulation  of  environmental  impacts  where  investors  or 
<br/>businesses are concerned, should tell the Ministry that in their pursuit of their balancing act, they 
<br/>must err on the side of the people’s social and economic well-being over unrestrained development 
<br/>for backdoor arrangements that may be above the pay grades of ordinary civil servants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  consider the incident  that came to  light  in  December 2021 where  a dubious World 
<br/>Wave  Project  had  a  proposal  to  dig  up  sections of  coral  reefs  of  the  remote  Qamea  and  Taveuni 
<br/>Islands for a world  leading project  to  create  a world class wave, even though that same area is  a 
<br/></span><span>renowned diving spot.  Once again, this environmental vandalism as well as the shady background 
<br/></span><span>of  some  of  the  investors  was  made  public  by  a  solid  investigative  piece  by  the  New  Zealand 
<br/>newsroom outlet who also exposed the Malolo environmental devastation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister was quick to down play that venture stating that approvals would 
<br/>not  be  given  if  there  was  any  environmental  damage  involved.    NFP  always  receives  constant 
<br/>concerns and questions by the public on many of the land use planning and development proposals 
<br/>that seems to ignore robust Environmental Impact Assessment safeguards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What should be fundamental for environmental regulators being paid by taxpayers, is that 
<br/>they are employed to ensure our social and economic wellbeing while safeguarding our environment, 
<br/>it is right there in the preamble of our Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, permit me to ask now why the 28-storey Friendship Plaza Tower right next 
<br/>door to the Holy Trinity Primary School in Suva continues to cause anxiety to taxpayers when pieces 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 695 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of equipment fly off during periods of strong winds especially when they are children of Holy Trinity 
<br/>right next door. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How will our National Fire Authority be able to put out possible fires in that high rise when 
<br/>we can all see that fire trucks have ladders and fire hoses that can only be extended to a certain height 
<br/>or length.  These questions amongst other drilled down to an EIA process not being as vigorous as it 
<br/>should be as the preamble of our Constitution says. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  countless  other  incidents  such  as  a  proposed  10-storey  residential  apartment  on 
<br/>Princess Road in Suva that was apparently approved by the Director of Town &amp; Country Planning 
<br/>with the acquiescence of Suva City Council despite the GO Technical hazards and the risk that that 
<br/>the development is sitting on a Tamavua Earthquake Fog line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then there are the other various dredging projects by the Ministry itself.  Are Environmental 
<br/>Impacts Assessments (EIA) reports for all those dredging exercises publicly available?  Why are not 
<br/>all legal submissions, rulings and court orders on environmental issues not available on the Ministry 
<br/>website?  Collusion, corruption and conflict of interest only thrive in the dark and the honourable 
<br/>Minister and is in your interest to shine a light on all your efforts to remove any perception of conflict 
<br/></span><span>of interest especially in this election year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  status  quo  remains  as  we  think  it  will,  all  these  questions  and 
<br/>uncertainties fall directly at the feet  of the honourable Minister and his executive team, and he should 
<br/>not at all be surprised at how he will be treated by those he works for; the voters of this country at 
<br/>the upcoming polls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for moving the Review of the Performance 
<br/>Audit on the Management of Environment Impact Assessment which was tabled on 21st September, 
<br/>2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before that, with regard to the Taveuni Project, honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said that I said … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- </span><span>Wawa, wawa</span><span>… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just carry on with your response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- There was possible issues raised about that project that could have 
<br/>an impact on the reef and environment.  She said that I said, that, that will not be approved.   No, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did not say whether it will be approved or not.  What I said was, “let the process takes its 
<br/>course”.   Before anything happens to that coral reef or that site, they will have to submit a terms of 
<br/>reference (screening application) for the Ministry to develop a terms of reference to under an EIA. 
<br/>That  EIA Report will then decide  whether the  Ministry will say ‘yes’  or  ‘no’.   I  cannot  say,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I should not say, I should not get involved at this stage at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project never started, they never did the EIA.  All they were saying was, “we are looking 
<br/>at doing a project here.”  If that is so and when they get permission, then they have to follow the 
<br/>process and one of the aspects of EIA.

<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  were  never  near,  that  and  they  started  jumping  and  saying,  “Oh,  what  is  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Environment doing?  Our reef will be finished, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, look at what they are saying in public, they want to form the Government, 
<br/>so is this how they are going to deal with investors? I am shocked that they want to be champions of 
<br/>the environment but they have no idea about the processes that are involved in approving a particular 
<br/>project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the EIA in Fiji is governed by Part 4 of the Environment Management Act 
<br/>2005 and the Environmental Management Regulation 2007. The objective of the Performance Audit 
<br/>was to determine the Department of Environment is effectively and efficiently managing the EIA 
<br/>process as a tool for sustainable development planning in Fiji. This was the brief of that particular 
<br/>audit nothing else. There was a concern that the usage on natural resources in Fiji and the need for 
<br/>development  to  be  carried  out  would  be  conservation  of  the  environment.    Sir,  there  was  some 
<br/>concern that whether the EIAs were done and whether the development project were done with due 
<br/>concentration of the environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Ministry of Environment welcomes the Performance Audit on the 
<br/></span><span>Management of the EIA, the Ministry is not at all satisfied in the way the audit was conducted by the 
<br/></span><span>Office of the Auditor- General does not agree with this financial. Let me know if you want me to 
<br/>provide the details.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final document of the Ministry receive from the Office of the Auditor -
<br/>General was the amended draft management letter and not the final copy of the audit report that was 
<br/>tabled in Parliament on 21st</span><span>t</span><span> September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so you see the report the report that was tabled in Parliament it was not the 
<br/>one that was presented to us.  No, it was the amended draft management letter. There was no final 
<br/>exit meeting between the Ministry and OAG that is supposed to happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- That is supposed to happen. How do we respond, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>when there was no exit meeting?  How did the Ministry respond to what they have stated there?  Give 
<br/>us an opportunity to respond, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is called the exit meeting. There was no exit 
<br/>meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, EIA is a highly technical and transparent process 
<br/>that is administered by the Department of Environment.  It is a legislated process under section 4 of 
<br/>the  Environment  Management  Act  2005  and  Environment  Management  Regulation  2007.    The 
<br/>Auditors  clearly  show  a  total  lack  of  understanding  of  the  EIA  process.  In  many  instances,  the 
<br/>Department had to build their capacity in the EIA process and its administration while being audited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the process of audit, we had to tell them, “no, this is how it happens, this is how we get 
<br/>external experts to undertake certain aspects of the EIA, the terms of reference that was given.  For 
<br/>instance, they repeatedly misrepresented and made sweeping statements that were incorrect whilst 
<br/>reporting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  Ministry’s  view  the  auditing  process  was  not  transparent.    The 
<br/>Ministry noted that during the audit process, survey questionnaires were sent to 29 EIA stakeholders 
<br/>on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> July, 2020.  To date, the Ministry is unaware of those stakeholders and what their responses 
<br/>were.  We want to see this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 697 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The survey questions were given to those 29 investors, what were the responses, so that we 
<br/>can provide a response to that.  There was no proper way plan shared with the Department indicating 
<br/>the audit steps/procedures, corresponding to respective timeline.  What was the basis of selecting 
<br/>those 29 EIA stakeholders?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is also concerned about the several inaccuracies contained in the audit report, 
<br/>for  example,  Table  4.2  details  the  list  of  EIA  reports  prepared  by  non-affiliated  consultants.  
<br/>However, the table includes four technical reports which are not EIA reports, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, 
<br/>how can you include in this non-technical reports?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under subsection 3.1.1, the auditors were provided evidence of all the business round tables 
<br/>and EIA clinics, including names of participants and clients who attended.  However, this information 
<br/>did not seem to be reflected in the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact last week, we had the Department of Environment staff, the Director 
<br/>and the PS, who were in the Northern Division undertaking EIA clinics face to face and meeting with 
<br/>potential investors, explaining to them the EIA process, how they need to comply, and hand holding 
<br/>them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But they never included these EIA clinic details in their report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under section 4.2.5, the auditor seemed to imply that there is the absence of proper internal 
<br/>control mechanisms within the Department of Environment, to ensure that proper documentations 
<br/>are maintained and ensuring that there is adequate trail of information that could be a contributing 
<br/>factor to anomalies found regarding the review report process.  This is not true reflection of the best 
<br/>practice standards established by the Department through SOPs, businesses processes, re-engineering 
<br/>and the systems put in place, ensuring appropriate documentations are maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry does not agree with the audit ratings provided on page 5 of the audit report.  
<br/>Majority of the ratings were between one and three.  Since 2016, the Department has significantly 
<br/>progressed  towards  fulfilling  its  regulatory  process  and  evidence.    The  number  of  EIA  reports 
<br/>processed by the Department increased from three in 2008 to 17 in 2016; 84 in 2018; and 93 in 2019, 
<br/>indicating a 550 percent improvement under three years.  Note again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, three in 2008 
<br/>to 93 in 2019.  That is the substantial workload, substantial output because you need to deliver on to 
<br/>this.  Investors are lining up, they want the EIA report, they want to quickly make the investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of prohibition notices issued also increased from one in 2013 to 34 in 2018 and 
<br/>55 in 2019.  What is the basis of saying that the Department of Environment staff are not active on 
<br/></span><span>the ground?  The report incorrectly indicated a lack of interagency consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Chairperson of the National Environments Council, the Ministry closely 
<br/>liaises and works with all the relevant agencies.  We consult Town and Country Planning, MCTT, 
<br/>we  consult  all  the  relevant  agencies,  all  key  processors,  including  key  agency  inputs  and  active 
<br/>liaisons.  There are joint visitors round the table that the Department collaborates with all agencies 
<br/>that have input into our service outcomes.  The roundtables were especially innovated for this purpose 
<br/>by the Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are undertaking consultations through roundtable discussions.  These 
<br/>are very different and the nature of this is that, we treat everyone equal so that there is seamless flow 
<br/>of information, questions and suggestions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department also collaborates with expert committees and agencies that are neutral.  This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also holds the Department’s decision-making accountable.

<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Environment is a capable and trained outfit with nearly 
<br/>100 of combined Environmental Management Practice Expertise captive with the management team 
<br/>with global, practical exposure.  There are ongoing training and capacity building efforts regularly 
<br/>enhancing science-based knowledge and information through various means.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A typical example would be the recent training commission team of seven Environmental 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prosecutors. The report failed to capture such critical information and reporting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now we have got our prosecutors trained by the DPP, but there is no mention 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of that in the Audit Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  regards  to  the  EIA  consultants,  the  Department  maintains  a  list  of 
<br/>qualified consultants and publishes the same.  The Department makes it available on the Ministry’s 
<br/>website.   This is made really accessible to the public, investment groups and developers.  So, the list 
<br/>is totally out on our home page.  The list of EIA consultants by nature on EIA, Mr. Speaker Sir. If 
<br/>you want to do a hotel development, this is the list of EIA consultants. These are the ones that you 
<br/>go to.  You want to do a waste management project? This is the list of EIA consultants you can go 
<br/>too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Contrary  to  the  claims  made  by  Auditor-General,  the  Department  does  not  entertain 
<br/>documentation from unregistered consultants.  No, show me the record. We do not.  How can we 
<br/>give it, ask you to go and hire an unregistered consultant?  They made this because not to qualify. 
<br/>This is the list, use this list, otherwise we will not accept it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last three years alone, the Department had to decline an EIA Report 
<br/>due to gaps.   That shows how thorough we are.  It is not that you have done it, you have paid $10,000 
<br/>to $15,000, you have given the report, we accept it.  I know, Mr. Speaker when you have rejected 
<br/>EIA  reports,  how  many  complaints  I  have  received  that  goes  to  honourable  Prime  Minster  or 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General? We know that, we have rejected it because we know there are gaps in 
<br/>it. They need to fix it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department issues strong warning letters. We have gone to the extent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of deregistering consultants who have short cut the process.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The  Department  regulatory  seeks  to  improve  its  consultation  practices.    For  example, 
<br/>currently, the Department is improving on the Consolidated Code of Practice in consultation with the 
<br/></span><span>SG’s  Office.  For  the  administration  of  risk  in  other  policies,  the  Department  has  developed  and 
<br/></span><span>implemented a Risk Management Policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For administration of risks to support good governance of the EIA process, the Department 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has established an internal audit team reporting to the Permanent Secretary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, customer service excellence from the regulator has not always been open to 
<br/>valid interpretations. We are a regulator, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so there will be complaints because people 
<br/>will find it at times that their way is not accepted, so there will be varying interpretations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  regulator  cannot  always  pleased  every  customer,  the  reason  being  that  potential 
<br/>compromise  on  environment  protection  by  some  roads  developers  under  the  guise  of  customer 
<br/>satisfaction, meeting the demand  is not always possible, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, contrary to the report, the Ministry’s proficient on the Conflict of Interest within the EIA 
<br/>has been very clear. There are policies within the Ministry that clearly spells out the requirements of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="99">Page 99</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 699 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conflict  of  Interest  situation.    There  are  documentary  requirements  from  staff  for  every  EIA 
<br/>application, there is a risk management policy put in place which has been shared, at least, with one 
<br/>other  agency,  additionally,  the  Department  has  key  documentation  in  place.    Staff  are  regularly 
<br/>trained to follow policies and procedures both internal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Department notes some recommendations from the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Public Accounts regarding internal  the role play by SDGs through EIAs.  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I am 
<br/>delighted to inform this House that the EIAs administered by the Department covers 15 out of the 17 
<br/>SDGs.   I want to thank the Honourable Members and I want to assure the people of this country that 
<br/>we are mindful, we are the custodian of the environment but all of us need to share this vision of 
<br/>protecting our environment, not only the Department of Environment then only we can protect the 
<br/>environment but viz-a-viz we are also ensuring that development takes place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister,  I  give  the  floor  to  the  Acting  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very quick just to clarify.  I think 
<br/>the  Honourable  Minister  for  Environment  and  Waterways  statement  clearly  demonstrates  the 
<br/></span><span>shocking report that was done by the Auditor-General.  In fact, Sir, I was just sitting here and one of 
<br/></span><span>the staff from Ministry of Environment was texting me saying, “The Auditor-General’s Office did 
<br/>not understand the EIA process themselves, yet they wanted to audit us.  They need to be trained on 
<br/>EIA first.  We had to train them so they could audit.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite that supposed quick training, that is the kind of report they came up 
<br/>with.  No exit interview and now they have opened that door, let me talk about it.  This Auditor-
<br/>General, Sir, refused to come to the exit meetings, refused to even come to the entry meetings.  He 
<br/>said, “Oh, it will be a conflict”; such a lame excuse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If his staff are there obviously vicariously he is involved with that and he is saying, “oh, it is 
<br/>a conflict of interest”.  These are the types of shenanigans that went on, reports were filed in without 
<br/>getting a comment  from their management.   If  you see, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I read out  the terms  of 
<br/>reference, nothing about changing the laws but  whether they are actually sticking to international 
<br/>standards also.  That is how proper audits are done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member from the other side having a narrative, they wanted to fit into the 
<br/>narrative.    This  is  why  precisely  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  becomes  even  more  damming  that  they  are 
<br/></span><span>towing a particular line and it appears the Auditor-General is towing the line come what may and has 
<br/></span><span>compromised the independence of that office. That is what happened in practical terms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Qereqeretabua  sits  there,  when  she  makes  comments  flippantly,  when  the 
<br/>Ministers respond and we respond, it just does not register.  Honourable Aseri Radrodro said “oh, 
<br/>only when the Freesoul matter was highlighted in New Zealand media therefore we acted.”  He does 
<br/>not  even  know  his  facts.    The  PM  was  noticed  before  the  New  Zealand  media  got  hold  of  him, 
<br/>prohibition notice was issued by environment, that is what came out in a court of law.  You see they 
<br/>come here, the paddle false information and make it as if that the environment people are not doing 
<br/>the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Qereqeretabua  talked  about  some  geological  issue  about  some  ten-storey 
<br/>building, that is not an environmental issue, it is actually an engineering issue.  You see whether there 
<br/>is enough rock there for the concrete to hit the rocks, the building will be stable.  This is a geological 
<br/>issue.  The issue in Taveuni that the honourable Minister raised.  It came out in the media, “oh, we 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are going to do this” any application made, no.  Did Environment approve it? No.  They just ran an 
<br/>article in New Zealand media, maybe they fuelled it, I am not sure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  same  way  the  other  day  there  was  an  article  in  the  overseas  media  saying  like  I 
<br/>mentioned the other day, Nanoaicake was going to be some crypto currency fun land.  It is an article 
<br/>written fantastically, nothing to do with us.  Someone overseas decides to do this, “oh, Fiji is a great 
<br/>place, let us do this.”  Does it make it factually correct?  Of course not.  It is our responsibility as 
<br/>Members of Parliament if you raise those issues, then you verify your facts rather than trying to get 
<br/>it to fit into a political narrative of yours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was, they went on about, “oh, he 
<br/>has left, et cetera”. His contract came to an end after five years like all other offices appointed by the 
<br/>Constitutional Offices Commission, the term comes to end at the end of five years and then you apply 
<br/>for the job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  can  apply  for  the  job,  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro  said,  “oh,  his  withdrawn  his 
<br/>application”.   I do not even know whether he applied or not.  I do not know where they got it from.  
<br/>It is with the Secretariat, there is an independent body that is appointed, a committee that is going to 
<br/></span><span>review all the applications.  I do not know what kind of information he is getting.  It is always the 
<br/></span><span>news, which news?  </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, exactly that is the problem, maybe Anish Chand, that is the problem 
<br/>again.  The kind of concoction that comes up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua said “oh, two months before the elections” not two months before 
<br/>the elections.  The first day of the elections can be held on is 6</span><span>th</span><span> July, not the election year.  It can 
<br/>also be held in January 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Just misleading Parliament 
<br/>again as usual the honourable Attorney-General.  What I said was two months into an election year 
<br/>not as he said two months before the election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the election year can also be held in January 2023.  So, 
<br/>how is two months into election year unless their year has more than 12  months?  See, this is the 
<br/></span><span>point.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  they  talked  about  conflicts  of  interest.    There  is  actually  a  form 
<br/>available at the Ministry of Environment where the staff actually fill out conflict of interest forms.  
<br/>You see these people get caught out and say, “Oh, as usual misleading Parliament.” No! We are not 
<br/>the ones misleading Parliament, they are the ones misleading Parliament with facts, come here with 
<br/>half-baked truths, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point is this … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Shameful!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- … that the decisions of the environment is also available.  
<br/>They just need to go and talk to the Department of Environment, they can get their decisions and as 
<br/>has been highlighted, in time to come they can be published on the website.  In the meantime, they

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 701 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are still available and you can still get it. Nothing is stopping you from getting those decisions by the 
<br/>Department of Environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to actually thank the staff at the Ministry of Environment.  
<br/>You know I find it really quite ironic that some of the issues that the honourable Minister Reddy is 
<br/>talking about when dealing with issues like dredging and silting, all of that happened in the 80s and 
<br/>90s and even before that when there was absolutely no consideration for the environment.  A former 
<br/>Minister has got his building built in Rakiraki right on the edge of the river.  God knows how he got 
<br/>that provision.  God knows how he got that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 1990s, there was supposed to be a river diversion in Nadi also for environmental issues.  
<br/>Money  was  given  by  the  Japanese  government,  the  money  disappeared,  development  took  place, 
<br/>today it is a flood prone area in front of the Colonial Plaza and now we are trying to rehabilitate the 
<br/>issue, now we are trying to rehabilitate it. We have already spent $10 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Please keep quiet. You have finished.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now rehabilitating, we got the plans in place but these are the kinds of shenanigans 
<br/>that went on.  They do not address that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We were in Vanua Levu last week and we 
<br/>were sitting in Koroinasolo  Village where we had a talanoa session with the people in the village 
<br/>and from that session </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> ran an article, I do not know if you saw it on page three, someone 
<br/>sent it to me, where they are saying that the villagers pleaded with the Government to make sure the 
<br/>process  are  fast-tracked  -   environment,  because  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  the  crowd we saw two saw 
<br/>millers who were sitting there, using the villagers to say, “get an EIA done, blaming the Department 
<br/>of Environment or Ministry to say, “oh, they are not doing their job, let us get it done.”  But these 
<br/>were the millers, one of them was sitting there in his dark sunglasses looking like a mafia warlord 
<br/>getting everything done.  That is what is happening and then the EIA, the poor environment guys get 
<br/>blamed and said, “Oh, you are not doing your job” then on the other hand they are being told, “you 
<br/>are being inefficient.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not an easy task when you have to address legacy issues, when you 
<br/>have  to  address  current  environmental  issues  and  current  development  issues.    There  are  a  lot  of 
<br/>things  to  juggle  including,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  public  demand,  including  things  like  pollution, 
<br/>including environmental degradation, we have to see what is going to happen in 10 to 20 years’ time, 
<br/></span><span>the opportunity for jobs, then there is, of course, a lot of the developers who are corrupt.  Of course 
<br/></span><span>they are corrupt, not all of them, some of them are very good, some of them are extremely good.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new company  that  has bought  44 per  cent  of EFL, the  first  thing they  did  was a due 
<br/>diligence on the environment because  you know Japanese companies  are very much stickless  for 
<br/>environmental compliance.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact I appreciate the work that is being done by the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Environment.  I  would  like  to  also  thank  this  young  group  of  people  and  we  get  the 
<br/>Opposition slandering them all the time, non-stop. It is very difficult. Slandering them all the time, 
<br/>standing up here and saying nothing was done because some New Zealand media wrote the article, 
<br/>not knowing that those people actually had to go and put a stop to that. A few years ago, before the 
<br/>2018 elections, when I went to Solevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka know I went there more than once, if you looked when it is low tide, you see all 
<br/>these boats had Freesoul written on it. Why? It is a gift.  So the people who are actually the owners 
<br/>of the land are also turning a blind eye. There is a development here in Sovi Bay, Nadroga.  The 
<br/>Department of Environment actually puts a stop work order on that for over a year, nearly two two

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years.  Now they are finally complying.  Guess what happened? They gave about 15 vehicles to the 
<br/>village of Vatukarasa.  That is a very delicate environment in the Sovi Bay Area.  The environment 
<br/>people stepped in and stopped it.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- How was it given in the first place? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the point.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Please, you do not understand, you are like Abhay Nand, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you do not understand and you are about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Please,  stupidity  must  be  criminalised  when  you  talk 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actually.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when environment department gives a plan, you have to do the consultation 
<br/>and stick to the plan.  Their job is to make sure you stick to what they have laid out, if they do not 
<br/>then they stop it. How was it due in the first place?  The development is going to take place but you 
<br/>have to XYZ.  Stick within the parameters, you step out and they will stop you.  Unless you can show 
<br/>how you can redress that situation or that breach, they will not let you start.  That is how the system 
<br/>works, honourable Professor Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  come  here  with  half-baked  knowledge  and  they  are  cast  aspersions  right  from  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, to his Permanent Secretary, to the Director and all the other staff that works for 
<br/>them.  Of course things can improve, but I would like to thank them for the very hard and in fact 
<br/>microscopic look that they have upon them.  We need to ensure that we continue to resource them, 
<br/>get more people in there and make sure that we constantly reviewing our laws to make sure that it is 
<br/>proper environmental compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not speak too much on the issue, but I tell you 
<br/>I was really shocked when I was hearing what honourable Dr. Reddy was saying.  Honourable Aseri 
<br/></span><span>Radrodro said, why are you shooting the messenger?  Look at his message and the quality of the 
<br/></span><span>report that they did when they did not follow the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Qereqeretabua said the same thing.  They are trying to fight for this office 
<br/>that cannot even do a professional job of what it is supposed to do.  Is that what we are doing in this 
<br/>House? We are lifting incompetence up, we are lifting unprofessional sorts of ways of doing …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  honourable  Minister  is  casting  aspersions,  misleading 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aspersions … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What is your Point of Order?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 703 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … on someone who is not in this House, on whom they had 
<br/>continuous  attack.    Listening  to  honourable  Dr.  Reddy,  he  is  making  the  assertion  that  he  did 
<br/>everything wrong.  He was there for five years.  When he started pointing things out to them then 
<br/>they got upset. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What is your Point of order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Stop that character assassination of him here when he is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of order is relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have heard the Point of Order, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the institute or the organisation that we expect to do 
<br/>an independent, professional assessment of the services of arms of  Government, they are supposed 
<br/></span><span>to the be the very best in doing this and the kind of report that honourable Dr. Reddy said that total 
<br/></span><span>incompetence, totally unprofessional and we have people standing up in this House  and saying, “you 
<br/>are trying to shoot the messenger”.  I am saying there was problem with the message and how the 
<br/>message was formulated if they cannot do a professional job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  as  Members  of  this  House  should  stand  to  make  sure  that  the  bodies  that  work,  the 
<br/>Independent Commissions do their jobs professionally.  So, when they produce a report, it is a quality 
<br/>report, its built on solid process. All of us should want that?  No one should want anything that is 
<br/>absolutely shoddy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am going to talk about some of the recommendations in that Report, but given that, I will 
<br/>not because I am just shocked with the way that it has been done.  One thing that I will say, while I 
<br/>will just pick on one particular issue, while I will just pick on one particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go to page 20 of this Report, we at the Mineral Resources Department we have set up 
<br/>our  own  Environmental  Management  Unit,  working  very  closely  with  the  Department  of 
<br/>Environment to look at all of these issues to do with foreshore, mining, gravel extraction, monitoring, 
<br/>mining and quarrying, et cetera.  So there is very close liaison  on with the Department - mineral, 
<br/></span><span>exploration, prospecting licences and all of these things, we work very closely with them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But if you look at Page 20, they talk about a number of exploration licences.  They are talking 
<br/>about Viti Mining that they were going through the phase of trying to get their exploration licence. I 
<br/>can inform this House that Viti Mining has now got its exploration licence, it is a local company and 
<br/>is now doing exploration in Viani in Cakaudrove.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in that report is mentioned the Amex Mining in the mouth of the Ba River.  They were 
<br/>doing their EIA at that particular point in time. For the iron sand.  That iron sand extraction, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is now taking place. If you go to Page 20 and read it, you will see how thoroughly they 
<br/>went through the process at Department of Environment to make sure that when the mining took 
<br/>place,  they  checked  everything  out.  They  went  house  to  house  survey  in  that  village.    They 
<br/>interviewed people, they look at the social impact before they gave their approval for the mining to 
<br/>take place - very, very thorough.

<div><span> Review Report - Performance Audit - EIA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were talking earlier on about the Sigatoka exploration and all that.  I am telling you, read 
<br/>that part of the Report and it tells you how thoroughly it was done.  Because you were talking about 
<br/>mining, mining is important but it has to be sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The best thing is we have now paid the first sets of royalty for the iron sand to the landowners 
<br/>there of about $325,000 and this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be  one thing that this Government will be 
<br/>remembered for.  From the time that Fiji was a Colony all that stuff that is under the ground belong 
<br/>to the Government, landowners would sit on top and they would get nothing of that royalty. It was 
<br/>this Government that gave 80 per cent of the royalty to the landowners and that is something that this 
<br/>Government will be remembered for. To give that royalty back to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we are talking about the people at Nasomo in Vatukoula. They have already received 
<br/>royalty of almost $1 million.  Almost $1 million at making a change in their lives everyday and that 
<br/>is what this this Government is about. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  those  who  have 
<br/>contributed towards the motion and also to the Minister of Waterways and Agriculture for clarifying 
<br/>the issues that were raised with regards to the Audit Report itself.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
