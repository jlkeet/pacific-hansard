<div><span>COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Parliament, Wednesday, 9</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  move  that  the  Commissions  of  Inquiry  (Amendment)  Bill  2022  be  debated, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voted upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LT. COL. I. B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commissions  of  Inquiry  Act  1946 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provides for the holding of  commissions of inquiry into matters of a public nature.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  section  2  of  the  Act,  His  Excellency  the  President  appoints  and  authorises  a 
<br/>Commissioner or Commissioners to inquire into any matter, which in the opinion of the President, 
<br/>would be for the public welfare.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, every Commission of Inquiry appointed must specify the subject, nature and
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>652 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, every Commission of Inquiry appointed must specify the subject, nature and 
<br/>extent of inquiry, given the seriousness of the matter that any Commission is tasked to conduct an 
<br/>inquiry into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  last  Commission  appointed  was  in  2007  by  the  then  His  Excellency  </span><span>Ratu 
<br/>Josefa</span><span> Iloilovatu Uluivuda, to inquire into and report on the appointment, conduct and performance 
<br/>of Magistrates, the operation and performance of the Magistrates Courts, including registries and to 
<br/>make  recommendations,  amongst  other  things,  on  the  elimination  and  prevention  of  any  corrupt, 
<br/>improper or inefficient practices within the Magistrates Courts in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  result  of  Commission  inquiry,  one  particular  Magistrate  was  terminated  because  of 
<br/>blatant corruption that he practised.  At that point in time, the particular, when the corruption got 
<br/>very high in Suva then he was moved to Labasa, when it got very high it was moved  to Ba, when it 
<br/>got very high then moved to Nadi.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I mentioned the other day, he had an agent in Nadi Market, where his agent would collect 
<br/>monies on his behalf and there would be various leniencies that will be afforded or, indeed, bails in 
<br/>various other things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act, however, has been amended on three occasions. Some 40-60 years 
<br/>ago  in  1961,  1970  and  1982  which,  amongst  other  things,  dealt  with  provisions  relating  to  the 
<br/>appointment of fresh Commissioners and Oaths of Commissioners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The offence provision, however, have either never been amended or were last amended in 
<br/>1961 amendments made to the Act. These provisions currently prescribe penalties that do not achieve 
<br/>the aim of deterring the commission of offences under the Act. As such, it is imperative for these 
<br/>provisions to be reviewed accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, therefore, seeks amend the Act to increase the penalties under Section 12, 13, 14 
<br/>and 16 of the Act which relate to offences or threats made to witnesses of the Commission, false 
<br/>interpretation, refusal to give evidence and insulting  a Commissioner or Secretary of a Commission. 
<br/>Sir,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Bill  does  not,  in  any  way,  introduce  any  new  offences,  it  simply 
<br/>changes the tariff or the penalties available.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, if honourable Members see the Bill, from Clause 2 of 
<br/>the Bill itself  is just substitutes $200, or to imprisonment of 6 months, substituting it with $1,000  or 
<br/></span><span>imprisonment for not exceeding 2 years, and similarly we will see the changes in the other provisions 
<br/></span><span>as I have highlighted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is critically important, Sir, when you have commissions of inquiry that is appointed by His 
<br/>Excellency the President, the Head of State of our country, that those commissions of inquiry are not 
<br/>taken lightly but seriously, and given the fact that these commissions of inquiry are not done willy-
<br/>nilly  and  very  far  and  in  between  those  ones  that  are  issued  that  we  should  have  the  appropriate 
<br/>deterrence in place. Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Acting Prime Minister.  Honourable Members, the floor is now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>open for debate on the motion. I give the floor to the Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU.  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  The  honourable  acting  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Cabinet, honourable Assistant Ministers and those in the Government Backbenchers, 
<br/>not forgetting the honourable Members of the Opposition; I wish  to also make a brief contribution 
<br/>on the motion that is before us, especially on Bill No. 4 of 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 653 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taking a snapshot, the Bill seeks to amend the Commissions of Inquiry Act, as alluded to by 
<br/>the honourable Acting Prime Minister, that is to increase the penalties under sections 12, 13, 14 and 
<br/>16 of the principal Act which relate to offences or threats made to witnesses of the Commission, false 
<br/>interpretation, refusal to give evidence and insulting a commissioner or secretary of the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the penalties are increased five-fold to a fine not exceeding $1,000 that is from $200, and 
<br/>our jail terms are up to two years, Sir.  The Bill increases the penalties for threats and insults made 
<br/>and injuries given to witnesses who give evidence to the commissioners, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In going down further, Sir, Clause 3 of the Bill, amends section 13 of the principal Act by 
<br/>increasing the penalties for interpreters, who wilfully give false interpretation of evidence or who 
<br/>make the untrue translation of documents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 14 of the principal Act by increasing the penalties for 
<br/>those who fail, without reasonable cause, to attend as a witness or to produce a document or other 
<br/>thing after being summoned to do so, or for those who refuse without reasonable cause to answer or 
<br/>to answer fully and satisfactorily to the best of their knowledge and belief any questions put to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill is amending section 16 of the principal Act, to increase the penalties for 
<br/></span><span>using threatening or insulting language to the Commission or to a commissioner or to its secretary, 
<br/>Sir.  These changes have come out of nowhere.   There is no obvious reason or justification for them.  
<br/>There is no evidence or credible explanation why are they necessary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  increase  in  penalties  in  the  Bill  is  totally  consistent  with  the  Government’s 
<br/>approach to law enforcement, Sir.  It is punitive and not educative.  The Government trace the people 
<br/>of this country as subject to be oppressed, threatened and subjugated.  It does not believe that the 
<br/>approach  of  educating  people  to  be  civil  and  respectful  of  the  law  is  good.    Instead  it  insists  in 
<br/>believing that always using a big stick against our people is commendable.  Sir, the justification for 
<br/>the Bill in the explanatory notes is spurious.  We, therefore cannot support the passage of this Bill, 
<br/>Sir. Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker for letting me contribute to the debate.  
<br/>But  before  I  do,  can  you  please  allow  me  to  respond  to  some  of  the  comments  that  were  made 
<br/>previously, some of which insinuate me personally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General in my contribution yesterday, on FBC had stated that I had 
<br/></span><span>to declare my interest.  That is totally wrong, Mr. Speaker.  That actually insults my professionalism 
<br/></span><span>because I know where to declare my interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  I  was  debating  then  was  in  relation  to,  in  my  view,  the  unlawful  use  by  FBC  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government grants as their income.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  action  or  the  current  court  case  that  there  is  between  me  and  FBC  is  in  relation  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>defamation.  They took out an action against me for defamation and they lost that in the High Court.   
<br/>They have appealed that to the Fiji Court of Appeal and I had asked for that adjournment and had to 
<br/>pay that cost, so totally different things, so I did not see the need to declare my interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, I note that in some of the contributions from the other side on Bills that 
<br/>are similar to this, the contention appeared to be that because the amendments are so small, some of 
<br/>those in relation to liquor licensing and tobacco we do not need to have consultation.  The gist of our 
<br/>concern is consultation and that is a democratic process.  We are required to be inclusive in the law-
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>654 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>making  process  and  we  are  ignoring  that,  so  we  cannot  call  ourselves  a  democracy  if  we  do  not 
<br/>consult. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  just  give  an  example  of  where  this  can  be  totally  useful.    I  am  sure  that  other 
<br/>honourable Members on that side of the House who are Ministers, do not occupy themselves with 
<br/>the many consultations that we attend to in this side of the House.  And you will be surprised of how 
<br/>small things are and the information and assistance that you get from the public in relation to that.  
<br/>Let me just give one example, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the tobacco licensing and the contention here in this amendment is to extend the 
<br/>licence from one or three to five years, they appear to be totally happy in relation to that.  If they had 
<br/>allowed for consultation (and I can tell you) in many villages, they will know that it is not like before, 
<br/>where you used to have co-operatives.  Today, you will see one person will be selling biscuits, another 
<br/>person will be selling kerosene only, another person will be selling tobacco or </span><span>suki,</span><span> there are many 
<br/>of them selling in  the villages for their livelihood and they  are all required by current  laws to  be 
<br/>paying licences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is totally unfair and if they had taken the opportunity to consult, they would have heard the 
<br/></span><span>request from them that they should remove the licencing completely.  That would be a fair thing to 
<br/></span><span>do, but they had shut themselves out from hearing what the other side or the voice of the public is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, we have already debated that and we have passed the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Yes, I am illustrating on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You made the point earlier about the side saying this and that, it was clear 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but now you are starting to go back to what we have already passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of order.  The honourable Member 
<br/>is misleading Parliament.  You no longer (he should know, he was in Parliament last year) require a 
<br/>business licence to sell biscuits or anything except, if it is specifically applied by the law like tobacco.  
<br/></span><span>For the tobacco, because of the health risks, that is why you need a tobacco licence.  You do not need 
<br/></span><span>a licence now to sell any other thing, other than alcohol or tobacco. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is misleading for him, Sir, to say that because now we are exempting just for one year for 
<br/>someone  to  pay  for  tobacco  licence,  therefore,  everyone  else  is  getting  disenfranchised.    It  is 
<br/>completely untrue because they do not pay a business licence fee in the first place, nor do they require 
<br/>one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- It is totally wrong.  I was illustrated an example of the need for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultation on why it is important to hear alternative views. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was also a comment that was made that implicated me which was in 
<br/>relation to Bill No. 17.  The honourable Attorney-General said that we had announced the concern 
<br/>that they will lose their land, but from that time until now, no land has been lost.   That is not the 
<br/>point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 655 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  I  said  that  honourable  Nawaikula  and  honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu in 2014, put out DVDs to say that iTaukei people lose their land with the support of the 
<br/>FijiFirst Party and because the Constitution now deprives them of their land rights.  I did not say in 
<br/>relation to Bill No. 17, I said generally SODELPA has spread misinformation about Bill No. 17.  Get 
<br/>your facts right! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Totally wrong again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He said that what we stated led to telling them the fear for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their land and that now no land has been lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Go to the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- The point is the concern in relation to the rights removed which 
<br/>are discriminatory and which I am surprised none of the native members have realised up until now.  
<br/>There are sitting there with a Minister supposedly a Minister for Indigenous Affairs, who have called 
<br/>for the removal of their cultural autonomy. We have passed about 23 cases that are discriminatory. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- And they still do not realise it.  Now, let me get to the Bill.  I am 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sure you are waiting for too long.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, stick to the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Yes,  I  will  stick  to  the  Bill  now.    This  Bill  is  asking  for  an 
<br/>amendment in relation to the penalties.  I think it is a good thing to learn a bit of the background in 
<br/>relation to the proposed amendment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now there is a Commission recently established who were appointed by the 
<br/>President for the inquiry into the works of the Office of the Auditor-General. As told by the other 
<br/>side,  the  last  Commission  of  Inquiry  was  made  in  2007  against  the  Magistrates.  We  have  now  a 
<br/>Commission recently established to look into the Office of the Auditor-General.  I am very, very sad 
<br/>to  know  this.    The  reason  for  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  view  is  simply  because  they  want  to 
<br/>intimidate because they cannot get through to stop the Auditor-General from revealing the neglect 
<br/>and even the likely corrupt practices of the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if you had listened to them, they were attacking every single report of the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General. I am on record too saying that this is the only remaining office that is truly 
<br/>independent now.  That side of the House now has control and we hear that.  We hear, we are told, 
<br/>they are now in control of the Police Department, of the Army and every other independent arm of 
<br/>the State.  The only one that was left was the Office of the Auditor-General. Very good because it 
<br/>allows  us  to  come  here  and  hold  them  to  account  because  the  Auditor-General  was  assisting  us, 
<br/>revealing every single instances over and over again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But not so anymore and you will remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when they raised the issue in 
<br/>relation  to  FBC,  Government  had  written  to  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to  remove  his 
<br/>statement.  I also had a </span><span>Facebook</span><span> post and you all know that your office to wrote me to remove that 
<br/>and I did remove it. But the point is, the concern and actions by the Government to intimidate. We 
<br/>have to ask ourselves, what kind of Government are we dealing with?  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it 
<br/>is because they are a dictatorship, they are not a democratic government, they cannot say that because 
<br/>they want to control every arm of the State and this is one example.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The appointment now of the Commission of Inquiry into the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>is an example of the Government intimidating, interfering and supposedly an independent arm so 
<br/>that it can control the whole institutions even the democratic institutions of Government including 
<br/>this one. We can say  we can  adapt  to that, they  are supposedly  a dictatorship masquerading  as  a 
<br/>democracy. That should be told, we should say that out loudly and we should say that out also to our 
<br/>traditional friends who are supporting this Government by giving out hand-outs, aids and donations. 
<br/>We should say out to them that this is not a democratic Government, this is a fake Government. The 
<br/>reality of it is that it is not a democracy, it is a dictatorship. They should know that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you have a fake Government, we have a fake Opposition.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, I will tell you the reason.  It is because that side of the House 
<br/>were borne out of treason, they were borne out of removing a democratic government, their only 
<br/>security is to be in power time and time again, even to the extent of rigging elections so that they are 
<br/>not held to account by the people.  The people want to take them into account for the treason and for 
<br/>the removal of a democratic government.  The only security for them is to be in power all the time.  
<br/></span><span>Well, you can answer to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I come now to the legislation. This one is asking for an increase in penalty. 
<br/>The point I wish to make is that, this amendment illustrates the fact that this Government does not 
<br/>have any holistic plan.  It operates in an </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> manner.  It is reactive.  This becomes necessary only 
<br/>after the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the other legislations that came this morning, you ask the question, there was 
<br/>an  amendment  here  in  relation  to  the  Hotel  Licencing  Act.    The  reason  was,  for  ease  of  doing 
<br/>business.  So why did not these come with that?  That too is a point that I am saying that it is an </span><span>ad 
<br/>hoc</span><span>; they do not have any plan, they do not even have an economic plan, they do not have a planning 
<br/>office, they just think up things overnight and this is one example in relation to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- The honourable Minister is asking me, where is my plan?   I think 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he should answer for his plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  You  should  go  to  all  the  hospitals  around  Fiji.    Go  to  Levuka 
<br/>Hospital and they will ask you, where is your plan?  Basic hygiene, Levuka and Savusavu Hospitals, 
<br/>just go to the toilets, those are not hospital toilets.  The honourable Minister Usmate is rightfully 
<br/>called the honourable Minister for Potholes.  He should go to Levuka and check out the road there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is on record yesterday saying, “I am not responsible for those people who do the roads.  
<br/>Go  and  ask  them,  I  am  only  the  Minister.”  Well  you  are  the  Minister  accountable,  you  are  our 
<br/>representative to those who are building the roads. We hold you accountable for every single pothole 
<br/>here and I do not think he has ever been to Levuka.  This person who calls himself the Minister for 
<br/>Roads has never seen the roads in Levuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- I was there two weeks ago and the state of the road is sinful.

<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- That is not a lie.  That is a fact; Minister for Potholes. He wanted 
<br/>to ask, he said, what would be our legacy?  He said our legacy is that we lit the electricity in Monasavu 
<br/>but let me tell the honourable Minister what we will remember his Government by.  .   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they will be remembered as the Government that:

<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>

<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>killed FSC; 
<br/>killed the sugar industry; 
<br/>lied about the economy calling itself “doom” when instead it was a boom; 
<br/>accumulated the latest debt in this country; 
<br/>did not grow the economy;  
<br/>gave us the worst roads in the history of this country;  
<br/>gave us the worst health situation in this country; and  
<br/>resulted in the worst education system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, free education, but if you look at their own books and annual accounts, these 
<br/></span><span>are the worst results ever in this country even though they are standing up and singing free education.  
<br/>These  are  the  worst  results  ever  in  this  country  even  though  they  are  standing  and  singing  free 
<br/>education but we want results and quality education. We want increase in passes and this is just the 
<br/>total the opposite.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member, I now give the floor to the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Professor Biman Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, this amendment really is a bit of a joke and it 
<br/>goes to show what I have said in this Parliament before (in the last Parliament and in this Parliament 
<br/>as well) is that the process as much as the law itself is very important; the process of law making.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Someone from the other side said, “We do not need to consult.” That is the last thing that a 
<br/>Government Minister should say.  The perception of process of law making itself is very important 
<br/>for developing a democratic framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It looks like and it is possible that this is the fastest created Bill in history by the way it came.  
<br/>It looks like the honourable Attorney-General actually thought it up on Tuesday after I criticised the 
<br/></span><span>Commission of Inquiry into the Office of the Auditor-General.  In fact, he will not be saying “watch 
<br/></span><span>out” and I told him not to threaten me and his response to debate questioning the credentials of the 
<br/>Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- That’s what I heard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>! You hear so many things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Well in my response to debate questioning the credentials of 
<br/>the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the Office of the Auditor-General, the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General actually read out Section 16 of the Commission of Inquiry and said that penalties 
<br/>for breaching it was very low and needed amending.  When I saw this Bill, I was a bit surprised.  If 
<br/>he had brought it in the next session of Parliament, I probably would have thought, “Okay, there has 
<br/>been some thinking about this Bill.” 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I mean sometimes I think the use of the Standing Order and the way these Bills 
<br/>are brought is actually of what the Attorney-General probably used to do when we was seeing all 
<br/>these overnight Decrees coming out during the Government that was there from 2006 to 2014.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have always said that laws, there are always unintended consequences.  
<br/>You may put out a law with a particular objective but once it comes into force, how it supplied, what 
<br/>are the consequences can be different even though this is just considered to be a simple amendment 
<br/>to raise the fines and the jail term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting, if anything, this Bill, this idea that okay the fine is low, 
<br/>the jail term is low because someone is going to criticise the Commission of Inquiry and you do that 
<br/>reflects the kind of mentality that this Government has. I kind of agree with a lot of the things that 
<br/>honourable Nawaikula said about this Government’s dictatorial behaviour. I know this idea of threats, 
<br/>intimidation  when  people  raise  the  issues.  This  may  be  a  small  example  of  that  kind  of  situation 
<br/>where you tell the people, “look, we do not like what you are saying, we are going to bring a law.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen in many instances since 2013 Constitution came into being.  I could list many 
<br/>examples where the laws, amendments came as a result of a particular event which did not make the 
<br/></span><span>Government look very good.  The Bill after honourable Nawaikula’s case, for example.  I know the 
<br/></span><span>Electoral laws were changed before 2014 Elections.  So, I do not know what kind of thinking is going 
<br/>within the Government, Mr. Speaker, to bring this kinds of laws and in such short notice.  I notice 
<br/>that the fine is to increase from $200 to $1,000 and the honourable Leader of the Opposition was 
<br/>giving the percentage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to look at fines and jail terms in the overall context of our society as well.  When 
<br/>you suddenly raise fines and jail terms, it is not necessarily about stopping people from saying things 
<br/>that you do not want them to say, but it could also mean other things as well.  When you raise fines 
<br/>and penalties, people are complaining about, for example, the LTA fines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of people are saying whether those kind of fines are commensurate with the kind of 
<br/>income, the kind of society that people are living in.  So, that is why it is very, very important, and 
<br/>raising  the  jail  term,  I  mean,  why  do  you  want  to  send  people  who  might  say  something  which 
<br/>probably borders on criticising the Commission of Inquiry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The court of law will …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Attorney-General always say this but let me 
<br/></span><span>tell  you,  when  people  get  charged,  they  go  through  a  court  process,  it  is  a  very,  very  painful 
<br/>experience for many people.  As a lawyer, the honourable Attorney-General should know that.  So, 
<br/>when you make laws, the laws ought to be reasonable as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We are making laws … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. Mr. Speaker, if you look at section 16 of the Act which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any person who uses threatening or insulting language to the Commission or to 
<br/>a  Commissioner  or  to  the  secretary  at  any  sitting  of  the  Commission,  or  to  a 
<br/>Commissioner or to the secretary at any other time or place in relation to or on account 
<br/>of his proceedings in the capacity of Commissioner or of secretary is guilty of an offence 
<br/>and  upon  conviction  shall  be  liable  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  two  hundred  dollars  or  to 
<br/>imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 659 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  emphasis  here  is  using  threatening  and  insulting  language  on  the 
<br/>Commission on a count of proceedings in the capacity of the Commissioner or Secretary.  So, there 
<br/>was nothing insulting or threatening in my intervention on Tuesday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  know  this  was  not  about  me  but  it  was  not  anything 
<br/>threatening or insulting.  If people say about the Commission.  This is part and parcel of the debate 
<br/>in Parliament, especially in Parliament, but at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, when we raise issues, 
<br/>even if it is about the credibility of a Chairman of a Commission of Inquiry in this Parliament, it is 
<br/>about looking at national interest, it is about looking at the bigger governance issues, so it is not that 
<br/>we bring these issues without any reason.  And we must create a national portrait in Parliament that 
<br/>we are to bring any issues in this Parliament which people think is of national importance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know a lot has been said with respect to the way the Bills have been 
<br/>brought.  I know someone told me that in the West, right from Sigatoka to Rakiraki, people who 
<br/>moved into the evacuation centres for more than four days had no support in terms of food rations. 
<br/>The NGOs are telling me, the communities are telling me and here is a Government which during 
<br/></span><span>the debate in Parliament instead of talking about working out the way in which they can help the 
<br/></span><span>people.  We are spending time bringing a Bill simply to increase the fine and jail term, so where is 
<br/>the priority?  People are asking about food rations, Mr. Speaker, in those evacuation centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the middle of all these crises, where we could debate a little bit more on how we can help 
<br/>our people, you know we had reports.  In fact, I was looking forward to the Ministerial Statement on 
<br/>child protection - a very important subject and I know the honourable Minister is doing a good job 
<br/>in her own Ministry like her predecessor.  It was going to be a very important discussion because we 
<br/>would have looked at the whole issue of poverty, child poverty.  That is the kind of debate that we 
<br/>should  be  engaging  in,  not  increasing  fines  and  jail  terms  just  because  you  know  you  feel  that 
<br/>someone is going to criticise the chairman of the Commission of Inquiry or the secretary once the 
<br/>Commission sits.  That is the point we are making and that is why it was not necessary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was unnecessary to rush this amendment into this Parliament.  I am sure because of the 
<br/>time that we are spending on all these Bills, we have not had any Ministerial Statement.  We did not 
<br/>have a Ministerial Statement from the honourable Minister for Health.  We were looking forward to 
<br/>Ministerial  Statements  and  they  have  not  brought  any,  Mr.  Speaker.    So,  that  is  why  we  cannot 
<br/>support this Bill.  I think they should withdraw this Bill, leave the fines and jail terms as it is, let us 
<br/></span><span>see what happens in the Commission of Inquiry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One more thing, Mr. Speaker, the motive behind this Commission of Inquiry is very important 
<br/>and that is why we oppose this Bill because what will come out of the Commission of Inquiry, I can 
<br/>predict, will be a law - amendment to the Audit Act to basically make the Auditor-General, like the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee, irrelevant in many ways because we have had the Government side talk 
<br/>about what the Auditor-General should not do or should be doing.  For example, they said, “The 
<br/>Auditor-General was auditing while the project was going on.”  That is a very good way to ensure 
<br/>that there is no wastage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In many countries, in fact, in England, Mr. Speaker, when they have big projects, the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Office monitors and audits as the project goes on because by doing that, they ensure that 
<br/>there is no wastage, that there is no mismanagement or corruption.  I mean, the Auditor-General’s 
<br/>Office in many countries do that, especially on large projects and if we had done, t we would have 
<br/>ensured that some of the projects which failed and have not been completed, Mr. Speaker, would 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been completed because the Auditor-General would have had a tab on that, so they were doing 
<br/>the right thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not want the next amendment to the Audit Act because the Government can make 
<br/>written laws as per the Constitution to determine the scope of the work of the Auditor-General.  It is 
<br/>a very important office.  Even if there are instances where the Government feels that the Auditor-
<br/>General probably did not do the right thing, the Government has an opportunity to go to the Public 
<br/>Accounts  Committee  and  correct  its  submission  or  whatever,  but  to  touch  the  Auditor-General’s 
<br/>Office unless, of course, Mr. Speaker, there is evidence of corruption or mismanagement, but to get 
<br/>the Auditor-General out of the job already.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- His contract expired.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And I hope Mr. Speaker, in the Commission of Inquiry that 
<br/>the former Auditor-General is actually invited.  He is allowed to go and make his presentation and 
<br/>submission and answer the questions from the Commission of Inquiry, but we will hold our breath 
<br/>on that, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Please, hold on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I fully support the Bill 
<br/>and I fully understand the intentions behind this Bill.  To them it is about strengthening the institutions 
<br/>of  Government  and,  of  course,  strengthening  governance  as  well.    It  shows  the  different 
<br/>interpretations  and  the  lenders  that  we  were,  but  let  me  just  go  again  to  the  point  raised  by  the 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad about food rations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the honourable Member if he has problems with some communities, can he call me 
<br/>directly?  He did it last year during </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>and </span><span>TC Ana. </span><span> We responded to the queries that he raised 
<br/>with us, but this is election year and he is taking a different direction altogether, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what is happening.  The last flooding that we had in Ba, I was on my way down to Ba 
<br/>(that was on Tuesday) and I saw in a </span><span>viber </span><span>group - Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises &amp; 
<br/>Development (FRIEND) (their proxy NGO) has already delivered rations to eight evacuation centres 
<br/>in Ba.  I knew what was next, I was anticipating it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a few minutes later, I had a call from </span><span>Fiji Village</span><span>.  First</span><span>,</span><span> there was an email from one Iva 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Danford and then the Director came. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- No, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Can  you  please  respond  to  the  statement  by  the  honourable  Professor  Prasad  because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FRIEND has already delivered the ration?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  say  this  to  this  august  Parliament,  let  us  not  politicise  humanitarian  work.    The 
<br/>National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) is NDMO, it is not a philanthropic organisation, it 
<br/>is not the Ministry of Social Welfare, nor the World Food Programme.  NDMO is NDMO.  We are 
<br/>bounded by the Disaster Act 1998 and the Disaster Management Plan 1995. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me clarify to the honourable Member, it is good that he brought it up 
<br/>now so that every Fijian will know this.  The Act clearly specifies that the element of self-reliance 
<br/>does not, in any way, be left out when evacuees come to an evacuation centre.  They are expected to, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 661 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at least, sustain themselves for the first 48 hours.  There is nothing in law but the Act says ‘initially 
<br/>for 48 hours’ because the initial damage assessment that will be provided by the District Officer will 
<br/>come after 48 hours.  So that is usually the guideline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  that  patronise  the  evacuation  centres  know  this  well.    They  bring 
<br/>everything to the evacuation centre - their food, blanket, cooking stove, et cetera.  But there are smart 
<br/>people there as well.  They will wait in the evacuation centres until they know that it is already 48 
<br/>hours and NDMO is about to bring the food. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hey, don’t blame the people </span><span>yaar! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We have smart people 
<br/>in the communities too and what makes things worse is when the politicians come in, lead the people 
<br/>to  very  high  level  of  expectations.    Let  me  talk  more  about  this  FRIEND  food  distribution,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They came to Ba, told the DO that they will look after eight evacuation centres.  The PA Ba 
<br/>told  them;  “Okay,  these  eight  evacuation  centres.”    But  after  the  eight,  they  were  also  seen  in 
<br/></span><span>Chinatown distributing rations.  That  is a targeted handout,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I witnessed this in 
<br/></span><span>Nawejikuma and Tramline in Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I came on the Wednesday, they have already been sent back to the communities after they 
<br/>have received their rations from Government.  FRIEND helped in Ba (thank you FRIEND), but there 
<br/>was another set up as we walked past Nawejikuma in one of the houses there, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I asked the PA Ba, “Please, just go and find out who that is”, and we continued.  The PA Ba 
<br/>came back and said; “That is FRIEND, Sir.”  Again, another targeted handout to the communities 
<br/>and what makes it worse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were some people standing there and they said, “no, 
<br/>we do not qualify because only the NFP supporters get the food from FRIENDS.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Point  of  Order.    I  think  the  honourable  Minister  is  totally 
<br/>telling a lie.  We have no links to FRIENDS in terms of distribution and his assertion that, that may 
<br/>have been NPF giving rations is totally false. I would urge the honourable Minister to refrain from 
<br/>making that kind of assertion. We do help people like you guys, individually, people call us well. Do 
<br/></span><span>not blame the people.  There are always people out there but do not say that people come there to the 
<br/></span><span>evacuation centre because they think Government will bring rations.  It is actually demeaning to the 
<br/>people who may need that.  This is a time when a lot of people who are struggling to make ends meet, 
<br/>I would urge the honourable Minister not to make that kind of assertion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have worked with FRIENDS, we 
<br/>Sashi  Kiran  very  well.    After  being  briefed  in  Ba,  I  asked  the  Commissioner  Western, 
<br/>“Commissioner, please go and talk to Sashi” because the Act says in section 29…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Conspiracy. … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is not conspiracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Go  and  talk  to  Sashi,  please  because  if  she  wants  to  do  humanitarian  work  then 
<br/>everything according to section 29 of the Act  must come through the DO’s Office.  Do not

<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come to the DO’s Office only for some and then go to China Town and other places doing 
<br/>other distributions.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She should stop it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Because  we  want  to  continue,  they  are  important 
<br/>stakeholders, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As I have said, NDMO is not a philanthropic organisation and that 
<br/>is why we need FRIENDS, that is why we need World Kitchen, that is why we need all our friends 
<br/>in humanitarian work because if it takes time for Government to come to the communities, some of 
<br/>them, because it is allowed through their Constitution or whatever to keep food.  We do not keep 
<br/>food.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again let me say that NDMO does not keep any food, whatever NDMO 
<br/>provides will depend on the assessment. As I have said we are governed by the Act, we are governed 
<br/>by the Disaster Plan and we are governed by Government’s Procurement Procedures in the Finance 
<br/>Instructions, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is reality.  Good that he brought it up so that right now as we 
<br/></span><span>speak  NDMO  is  distributing  in  Nalele,  Malomalo.    Sir,  NDMO  is  distributing  in  Nadi  for  the 
<br/></span><span>residents  of  Nawajikuma  who  usually  come  to  Saint  Andrews  and  Nadi  College.    We  know  the 
<br/>communities well because we deal with them, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would ask the honourable Member, if there is a community that is contacting him for rations, 
<br/>pass it over to me and I will deal with it, with the staff. Again, let me say this, last year he did that 
<br/>when he was in Vanua Levu for </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>. But this year his decided to take a different 
<br/>direction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. Again, to all honourable Members of the House, I am not 
<br/>a  lawyer.    There  is  a  difference  between  amendment  and  a  review  of  an  Act.    A  review  is  a 
<br/>comprehensive process, I see the honourable Waqanika smiling because when you do reviews there 
<br/>will  be  certain  portions  of  an  Act  that  will  be  repealed  totally  but  when  we  do  amendments  it  is 
<br/>mainly some problematic areas that probably just needs to be fixed so that work continues, services 
<br/>continues, et cetera.  This is an amendment, it is not a review.  The consultation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of 
<br/>course,  we  also  understand  that  there  has  to  be  consultation,  but  there  is  a  big  difference  in  law 
<br/>making about a simple amendment and a review of an Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, let us put this into proper perspective and let us go ahead with the business before the 
<br/></span><span>House.  I just wish to again say that it is not for punitive actions but, of course, as I have stated, we 
<br/>need to strengthen and protect the institutions of Government as well and most importantly, penalties 
<br/>and sentencing, it is meant to be a form of deterrents as well.  That is why we need to increase this, 
<br/>so that it brings that element of deterrents to probably those who will offend in the future and those 
<br/>who are thinking along that line.  That is my contribution and I support the amendment to the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the honourable Acting Prime Minister to speak in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members speaking from 
<br/>the  other  side  only  focussed  on  insulting  the  Commissioner  or  the  Secretary,  which  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad seems to be focussed on who is bad maybe,  that is what he intends to do.    The 
<br/>penalty provision is also for penalty for threats to witnesses.  If someone wants to come and give 
<br/>evidence  and  someone  may  know,  his  claiming  honourable  Professor  Prasad  that  government 
<br/>threatened, so if someone wants to give evidence against government to the Commission of Inquiry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 663 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if  someone  from  the  Government  threatens  them,  then  there  is  an  offence  by  that  Government 
<br/>member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  we  have  penalty  for  false  interpretation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    A  person  or  interpreter 
<br/>wilfully gives a false interpretation.  Then you have a penalty for refusing to give evidence, that is 
<br/>another  offence.    Then,  of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  have  insulting  a  Commissioner  or  the 
<br/>Secretary.  These penalties as Honourable Lalabalavu said, “Oh, it is a huge increase.”  I am sure 
<br/>honourable Lalabalavu is old enough to know that in 1960 $200 was actually a lot of money and he 
<br/>would agree with that, please shake your head in agreement because that was the deterrents. For 60 
<br/>years, that penalty has not changed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did a little bit of calculation.  Even if you apply $20 a year, $20 multiply by 60 years gives 
<br/>you $1,200, and we only now saying $1,000. You have to contextualise it.  Do not look at the $200 
<br/>penalty in today’s context, look at the $200 in the 1960 context.  That is the level of importance that 
<br/>the law makers at that time gave this particular offence and that was a huge deterrents at that point in 
<br/>time.  This is why no one actually did anything untoward under the Commission of Inquiry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before the magistracy was a Commission of Inquiry into the Vatukoula Gold Mine an issue 
<br/></span><span>and there was one before that.  I think G.P. Lala or someone was on that Commission.  You must 
<br/></span><span>have seen, there was a Commission of Inquiry to the Vatukoula Gold Mining issue, there was a one 
<br/>before that.  I think G.P Lala or someone was on that Commission.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to 
<br/>look at the context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Nawaikula  obviously  has  done  his  little  song  and  dance.    Sometimes  he  is 
<br/>entertaining but he is bit more than that, now he is bit of a tragedy, because he is actually quite a 
<br/>massive joke in respect of this Parliament.  Only institution in Fiji that is independent is the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General.  Honourable Professor Prasad joins him and says, “I know this is what is 
<br/>going to happen, I know that the Act will now be changed.”  How does he know?  Is he God?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I said predict.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  He  predicted,  same  thing.    He  predicts.    When  I  predict 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something it means I know it is going to happen.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what you have done in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is what his done.  This is the level of contribution by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>someone who insists on being called honourable Professor Biman Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to make is that this is all about threat and 
<br/>intimidation.  How is that a threat and intimidation?  None of the offences are changed.  No new laws 
<br/>have been amended.  No words have been introduced. The only aspect of this particular Act which 
<br/>goes back to 1960, in fact, the Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, goes back to 1946.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even if you take 1960 when the penalty was changed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes back that far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only thing that has been changed is just the penalties sum and the imprisonment term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I like to also read out, honourable Lalabalavu in the Business Committee 
<br/>made this extra ordinary claim, he said, “I want to talk about the Auditor-General, God knows what 
<br/>they have done, we do not know we are in the dark, it is gazetted.” You need to have your Opposition 
<br/>people in your office to read your gazettes.

<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will read it out to you, Sir. It is in the gazette.  I should not read it out to you but I will do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you a favour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “The  Commissioners  are  the  chairs,  Winston  Thompson,  the  other  two 
<br/>Commissioners are Fay Yee and Lala Sowane and in particular to inquire into and report 
<br/>on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The conduct, operations and performance of the Office of the Auditor-General; 
<br/>The capacity of the Office of the Auditor-General to carry out its functions and duties 
<br/>effectively and efficiently under the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, the Audit Act 
<br/>1969 and any other written law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Whether the Office of the Auditor-General is carrying out its functions and duties and 
<br/>exercising its powers in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, the 
<br/>Audit  Act  1969  and  any  other  written  law  enacting  within  the  scope  of  its 
<br/>Constitutional and legislative powers, duties and functions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Whether the Office of the Auditor-General is carrying out its functions and duties in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accordance with internationally accepted audit procedures and requirements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Any  associate  matters  which  the  Commission  may  consider  to  be  relevant  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>general objectives of the inquiry;  
<br/></span><span>To  make  recommendations  to  eliminate  and  prevent  any  unlawful,  improper, 
<br/>ineffective or inefficient practices in the Office of the Auditor-General; 
<br/>To make recommendations for the effective and efficient delivery of the functions and 
<br/>duties of the Office of Auditor-General under the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, 
<br/>the Audit Act 1969 and any other written law; 
<br/>To make recommendations for the adoption by the Office of the Auditor-General of 
<br/>internationally accepted audit procedures and requirements and any other standard and 
<br/>transparent operating procedures.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the scope and the Terms of Reference as some people call it of this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission of Inquiry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes on further to say, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“And I further direct that the Commission by His Excellency the President shall 
<br/>submit its findings and recommendations to the President of the Republic of Fiji within 
<br/>three months of the date of appointment or upon the Commission’s request such longer 
<br/></span><span>period as the President of the Republic of Fiji may direct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission has a liberty to report its proceedings and findings from time to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time to the President of the Republic of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without  prejudice  to  the  powers  grant  to  the  Commission  under  the 
<br/>Commissioner of Inquiry Act 1946, the Commission may conduct such parts of inquiry 
<br/>that may deem appropriate in camera.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Commission may exercise all such powers that may be necessary for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purpose of inquiry and may lawfully be exercised by the said Commission.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is all guided by the law and he went on, “I will hold my breath until the 
<br/>former Auditor-General’s invited.”  Of course, no Commission of Inquiry will be worth its weight if 
<br/>they  did  not  talk  to  all  parties  past  and  present  and  he  is  indirectly  character  assassinating  these 
<br/>Commissioners. That is what he is doing in this Parliament.

<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 665 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Nawaikula, I just want to go back to him and what he said.  
<br/>This is the man who after the events of 19</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2000 was very busy in his office doing a Deed of 
<br/>Sovereignty. He was part and parcel of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Point of Order.  Please withdraw it, it is a total lie.  Do not come 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here and make statements that are unsubstantiated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It was you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- I knew nothing of that document and I am not sure where he got 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his information from…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- That is your story…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- So, please withdraw that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  I  have  certain  documents  when  I  was  doing  my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>research…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Bring it here, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Not to Parliament, which I have evidence of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore he talks about killing the sugar industry. He was instrumental 
<br/>with  Qalikau  going  around  Vanua  Levu,  telling  landowners  not  to  renew  their  leases.    He  was 
<br/>instrumental in that and he has the audacity… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. N. Nawaikula interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Now, there you go!  See, you cannot do anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. N. Nawaikula interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  He  had  the  audacity  to  say  that  we  have  killed  the  sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As I highlighted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Parliament today, 43 per cent of cane farmers cut less 
<br/></span><span>than 100 tonnes, 75 per cent cut less than 300 tonnes.  We have suffered and honourable Prasad will 
<br/>never acknowledge that because now he is on the other side.  He has gone on to the dark side, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was that, he was saying, oh! Here 
<br/>we go I was just been handed a friend’s post saying “we work as a team, NFP” A friend’s post here.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what bothers us is that honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>666 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nawaikula is saying, “Let us go and tell all our development partners, let us tell the development 
<br/>banks, the bipartisan donors who are giving us grants, budget support, loans, not to give it to Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if indeed we were what he claims we are, 
<br/>none of them would have given us money  because they believe in our financial management service.  
<br/>They believe in our financial management, they are not stupid unlike some people in this Parliament.  
<br/>They are not silly.  They have seen our track record, they have seen our objectives, they have seen 
<br/>our financial management.  They know what our goals is, what our vision is, what are the long-term 
<br/>plans for the economy, and that is why they are supporting us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  thing  also,  they  know  that  this  is  the  only  Party  and  the  only 
<br/>Government that can give stability to Fiji.  No other Party can, and it is the fact and when I stood up 
<br/>in this House and I have said about budget support, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have debunked it.  But the fact of the matter, is Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand, for example, have never given direct budget support.  That is a fact.  The fact is that we 
<br/></span><span>never receive loans from JICA at 0.001 per cent, that is a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, China gave us expensive loans.  Now,  you  are saying because of China 
<br/>factor. Australia and New Zealand did not give us budget support because China factor, which other 
<br/>Pacific island country have they given direct budget support too?  You do not know that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the reality and they come here and they stand and they talk about 
<br/>these  things  without  knowing  the  hard  core  realities  of  it.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  this 
<br/>particular Amendment…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  point  I  want  to  finish  with  that,  what  honourable  Nawaikula  wants,  what  he  is 
<br/>saying by that, to tell this people not to give us any money, he wants the Government to collapse but 
<br/>more importantly that is how he sees up to his nose.  But he, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the process, wants  
<br/>the ordinary Fijians people to suffer because all the policies that we have implemented has assisted 
<br/>the Fijian people in particular in the past two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- See this is the problem, I want you out especially you, it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not about me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- It is about you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- There you go!  See, this is the level of mentality, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gavoka, that you have people in your Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lalabalavu, that is the level of mentality that we have and we expect this mob 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here to be the alternative government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He does not inspire confidence in ordinary Fijians.  We have 
<br/>been told so many times and I am sure the honourable Minister for Health has been told - yes, there 
<br/>may be queues in hospitals, yes maybe the toilet is not as clean as it should be, but they all have said,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>667  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that thank God that this Government was in control when COVID-19 came.  If 
<br/>these are the people in control, it would have collapsed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment to the Commission of Inquiry Act is supported.  It gives 
<br/>credibility to the Commission and we need to ensure that the integrity of this Commission is protected 
<br/>so that they can deliver as per their terms of reference which have been put together by His Excellency 
<br/>the President.  Thank you, Sir.
