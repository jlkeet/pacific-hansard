<br/>Bill is related to the Investment Act that has already been passed last year by Parliament and this has 
<br/>essentially to do with the currently what we call Investment Fiji, the organisation and its functions 
<br/>and we are referring this to the Committee, Sir, so the Committee can get back to us regarding this

<br/></span><span>anything further you would like to add.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I have no further comments, Sir.  Thank you very much.
