<div><span>Transformative Institutional Capacity Development  
<br/>(Question No. 37/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation 
<br/>update Parliament on the Transformative Institutional Capacity Development initiative? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development (ICD) is led by the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation in
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partnership with the Ministry of Economy. This was endorsed by Cabinet in January 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ICD initiative aims to strengthen the role of national women machinery and enhance the 
<br/>capacity to fulfil their mandate as a catalyst for gender equality and women’s empowerment.  It is an 
<br/>institutional  mechanism  and  coordination  structure  with  the  formation  of  Gender  Mainstreaming 
<br/>Action Groups (CMAGs) for the development of gender mainstreaming action plans using a whole 
<br/>of Government approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative aims to institutionalise gender responsiveness on Government 
<br/>legislations, policies and programmes.  Agencies will develop skills for gender mainstreaming and 
<br/>gender  responsive  planning  and  budgeting.    Furthermore,  Sir,  the  ICD  is  now  a  component  of 
<br/>Government’s annual budget process and is currently piloted with nine agencies which includes the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy,  Ministry of Youth  and Sports, Ministry of  Fisheries, Ministry  of  Forestry, 
<br/>Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  Fiji  Police  Force,  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade  and 
<br/>Tourism  and  Transport,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  goal,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  it  aims  to  provide  an  enabling  environment  for 
<br/>Government agencies and officials to identify and apply women and girl’s needs, interests, concerns, 
<br/>contributions,  perspective  into  policies  programmes,  budget  and  reports.  Moreover,  it  is  a  step 
<br/>towards accountability and transparency to women and girls but also towards achieving, inclusive 
<br/>and sustainable development outcomes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative is supported by New Zealand, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
<br/>Trade,  rendering  the  technical  advisory  services  of  the  Fiji  Women’s  Rights  Movement,  the 
<br/>Government  of  Canada  for  the  provision  of  a  short-term  technical  experts  on  gender  responsive 
<br/>budgeting, gender analysis and this has been done upon the request of my Ministry and Fiji Women’s 
<br/>Rights Movement to support the development of knowledge products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Supported by Asian Development Bank for the provision of a short-term technical expert on 
<br/>gender  budget,  assessment  analysis  seconded  to  the  Ministry  of  Economy  from  September  until 
<br/>November, 2019.  Of  course, we have partnered  with  an  Indonesia’s South-South  and  Triangular 
<br/>Cooperation for the provision of short-term technical assistance to develop a training manual, training 
<br/>of trainer sessions.  I must highlight that the Ministry recognises achieving the goal of gender equality 
<br/>is not a straight forward or a simple path that can be taken alone or made with a checklist or one 
<br/>interventions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, achieving the goal of gender equality is a process that requires listening, 
<br/></span><span>transformative  approaches,  partnerships,  relationship  building,  new  ways  of  working,  finding 
<br/>solutions  with  improved  data  and  commitment  to  foster  an  enabling  policy,  budgetary  and 
<br/>institutional structures for gender equality that adequately protects girls and women’s rights, tackles 
<br/>the barriers they face and meets their particular needs and interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  main  outcome  of  the  gender  transformative  institutional 
<br/>capacity  initiative  is  to  develop  and  enhance  government’s  capacity  and  competence  on  gender 
<br/>mainstreaming with the focus on gender analysis.  In addition, it aims to raise the profile and overall 
<br/>capacity  of  my  Ministry  as  a  national  central  gender  policy  coordinating  unit  while  providing  a 
<br/>gender roadmap, structures and measures to deepen the collective efforts and accountability across 
<br/>the Government for promoting gender equality and particular achieving the sustainable goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  and  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explanation.  My question is, what are some positive impacts that has been achieved through this 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initiative  or  some  challenges?    I  ask  that  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  one  of  the  biggest 
<br/>performance indicator of gender equality mainstreaming throughout the civil service is in the annual 
<br/>reports. Annual reports for all the ministries that I have come across in the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs only reflect the staff composition in regards to males and female in the Ministry and 
<br/>not how the gender equality mainstreaming is being undertaken in the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- The question is the impact.  I asked that in the very beginning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you were not listening.  May I ask it again, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the thing is, for supplementary question, you should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just ask the question.  Do not explain the question, ask the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question was asked first, and the question 
<br/>was,  what  has  been  some  positive  impact  or  challenges  that  has  been  brought  about  in  the 
<br/>implementation of this initiative? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very new initiative.  Actually, I forgot to tell 
<br/>you the progress of that.  We are still in the process of training, having training done within the first 
<br/>nine agencies.  Altogether, we have 20 Government agencies.  Once the training is done by the donors 
<br/>that I mentioned, it comes at a cost of $500,000, that is the budget for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is totally funded by donor agencies and because we are in the early stage of the training of 
<br/>trainers process, and we have not completed all the other Government agencies, we will not be able 
<br/>to know the impacts of it now.  But we do hope that the impact would be where gender mainstreaming 
<br/>becomes part of every Ministry and people are more conscious of the needs of the two genders when 
<br/>it comes to reporting or budgeting.  It is in a very early stage, honourable Radrodro, and once we 
<br/>complete all the 20 agencies in terms of training, then we will start implementing it, and hopefully 
<br/>we will see the results then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing Frequent Flooding at Wailotua 
<br/>(Question No. 43/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment 
<br/>inform  Parliament  about  the  Ministry’s  plans  to  address  the  frequent  flooding  in 
<br/>Wailotua Village, Tailevu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three causal factors that are contributing 
<br/>to flooding of Wailotua Village.  One is the excessive rainfall, second is the topography of the place 
<br/>and the third is the Wailotua Creek.  So I am going to talk about three things.  Out of these three, two 
<br/>we cannot do much about, but the third one I will say what we will be doing.  With regard to rainfall, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the January rainfall recorded was 876.91 millimetres, which is twice the amount 
<br/>that  was  received  in  January  last  year.    It  is  much  more  than  average  annual  rainfall  that  was 
<br/>experienced in that area.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the short to medium term, there is nothing we can do 
<br/>with regards to the intensity of rainfall. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>733  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second causal factor is basically, this Wailotua area is a flood prone area due to the nature 
<br/>of  its  location  where  its  natural  ground  level  is  lower  than  the  levels  of  the  surrounding  areas, 
<br/>including the mountains in the main King’s Highway.  The village is situated approximately four 
<br/>metres  below  the  King’s  Highway  and  the  mountain  adjacent  is  200  metres  in  elevation.    So  in 
<br/>simpler terms, Wailotua Village can be assimilated to a basin that collects storm water during heavy 
<br/>downpour periods.  There are a number of areas in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was designated as a 
<br/>retention basin - a ponding area, and it was clearly demarcated that this area should not be allowed 
<br/>for residential purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  in  the  interior,  this  area  should  not  be  marked  out  but  around  the local  government 
<br/>areas, the municipal areas within the peri-urban areas, those areas are marked out and should not be 
<br/>allowed for residential development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, even in the local peri-urban areas, natural ponding areas have been allowed 
<br/>for residential development for some reason or the other, but in the interior this has not been marked 
<br/>over the years but these areas were inhabited by people. Unfortunately, during those times, there was 
<br/>not much rainfall intensity but now with heavy intensity of rainfall, these areas have now become 
<br/>ponding areas - a retention basin.  So, nothing can be done about that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless these 
<br/>communities are relocated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third factor, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Wailotua Creek which is silted and our staff have 
<br/>examined that and we would  want  to  undertake  a desilting of the Wailotua Creek.  So it is  four-
<br/>kilometres of the Wainibuka River as well as the Wailotua Creek which is about 2.5 kilometres that 
<br/>need to be desilted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are looking at advertising this, plus a number of others, close to, 100 rivers and creeks 
<br/>tomorrow in the dailies for a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model that we have adopted over the 
<br/>years, so we are looking at undertaking that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr, Speaker, Sir, in the short to medium term, these things can mitigate, but I think in the 
<br/>longer run this community and a number of other communities that we have identified, together with 
<br/>the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, it would be better to move them to a safer and 
<br/>higher ground so that those areas do undertake its original intended purpose of ponding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- A supplementary question to the honourable Minister; 
<br/>can he inform the House if plans are in place to dredge the Wainibuka River, to minimise flood build-
<br/>up in the tributaries and one of which he has referred to, that eventually rise high enough to flood 
<br/></span><span>villages along those tributaries or along the Wainibuka River itself? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  know  whether  that  is  on  our  list,  the 
<br/>Wainibuka  River, but the larger rivers, dredging needs to be undertaken by the use of a dredger and 
<br/>we are expecting a dredger sometimes in January and February next year. The smaller rivers can be 
<br/>undertaken through the  use of  an excavator  with super  extension  boom.   We can do that,  we  are 
<br/>advertising it tomorrow and there will be close to 100 rivers and creeks that will be advertised.  I just 
<br/>do not know the width of this river and its status, but we can examine that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- One more question but there are three of you, so  I will give it to the best 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looking who is Honourable Gavoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister, given 
<br/>the frequency of flooding these days in flood-prone areas, can there be provision for boats to enable 
<br/>the villagers to move around because in Wailotua, flooding could be three or four days? Wailotua 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Village could be underwater for those many days and it can be useful having boats during floods. 
<br/>Can that be provided to places like Wailotua? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is something that NDMO could look 
<br/>into.  I think the honourable Minister has alluded to in one of his responses that they are examining 
<br/>that and that is something that we could also talk to them about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Healthy Lifestyles and Diet 
<br/>(Question No. 44/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the high level of NCD cases in Fiji, can the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the Ministry’s efforts to promote 
<br/>healthy lifestyles and diets?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that 
<br/>question.    Sir,  NCD  is  a  global  health  concern  with  cardiovascular  diseases,  respiratory  diseases, 
<br/>diabetes and cancer at the forefront in virtually all developed and developing nations.  It is estimated 
<br/>by World Health Organization (WHO) that there are 41 million people annually, who lose their lives 
<br/>through NCDs, which accounts for 71 per cent of all deaths globally.  Of this, more than 15 million 
<br/>people die prematurely before 69 years old.  Sir, 77 per cent of all NCD deaths are in low and middle 
<br/>income countries.   We all know it is  a challenge in  the Pacific, and we are not  only alone in  the 
<br/>Pacific but other regions as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I read an article several years ago by one of the most senior public health 
<br/>physicians then, I think it was Dr. Pashu Ram, who said that the prevalence of diabetes in 1970 in 
<br/>Fiji’s independence was only 2 per cent.  Our data in 2000 showed that it was up to 15 per cent.  So, 
<br/>you  can  see  that  within  that  30  year  period,  we  have  moved  quite  significantly  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>prevalence of diabetes, and all of us know what the risk factors are.  This, obviously, leads to high 
<br/>blood pressure, high sugar level and also high fat in the blood or high lipidemia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Government and the Ministry recognises the huge burden, and also that we want to ensure 
<br/>that we reduce the one-third premature mortality from NCDs through the prevention and treatment 
<br/>in the many ways, including the advocacies that happen, the taxes on MCG and sugar-sweetening 
<br/>beverages, to help curb the intake of sugar, the Tobacco Control Act 2010, and the increase tobacco 
<br/>taxations since 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Food and Heath Guidelines for Fiji</span><span> was published as an advocacy and counselling tool 
<br/>and these are taken by our health staff as they go out into the communities, and also the work done 
<br/>by the National Food and Nutrition Centre (NFNC).  We have also developed the </span><span>My Kana </span><span>App by 
<br/>the NFNC, which is a food and gardening App, to help Fijians grow and eat healthy foods.  It also 
<br/>allows Fijians to be able to see what their recommended calorie-allowance intake is daily. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  established  a  Wellness  Unit  and  it  reports  to  the  Chief  Medical  Officer.    It  is 
<br/>responsible  for  establishing  NCDs  Strategic  Plan  that  guides  our  response  to  NCDs.    It  involves 
<br/>working with the:

<div><span></span><span>

<br/></span><span></span><span>

<br/>Package of Essential Non-Communicable (PEN) Disease and also in other areas;  
<br/>public  education  and  exercises  such  as  social  media  pages,  print  media,  virtual  live 
<br/>streaming and the developing of health promotion videos;

<div><span>partnership and collaboration with Diabetes Fiji, Medical Services Pacific, and even with 
<br/>organisations, such as Courts and Sports World; and 
<br/>ongoing virtual and face to face training on NCD Prevention with our partners, such as 
<br/>Goodman Fielder, APTC, Fiji Sports Commission, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the areas in which we have involved in the promotion of mechanisms to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be able to prevent NCDs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response.  
<br/>I also do support and promote healthy lifestyle and diets for everyone here in Fiji and in the world 
<br/>because it is important to build up our natural immune system to fight all these non-communicable 
<br/>diseases.    My  question  is;  what  is  the  effect  or  impact  of  healthy  lifestyle  and  diets  against 
<br/>communicable diseases and viruses?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of literature out there that healthy 
<br/>lifestyles, healthy food, healthy eating and exercise helps to simulate and boost our mechanisms to 
<br/>be able to look after ourselves when we get sick with disease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very simple way to think of it, Mr. Speaker, and through you to honourable Bulanauca is 
<br/></span><span>that, when one is beset with a disease or has an injury, there are three important things that come into 
<br/>play and determines the outcome:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>How well they were before they had the disease. So, if you were very well, very fit and 
<br/>very healthy and you had a major accident, you have a possibility of a good outcome. 
<br/>The severity of the disease that hit you.  So, if you had a major road traffic accident, then 
<br/>your outcome will be lower.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Your treatment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  are  the  three  important  things,  so  you  can  see  that  in  a  very  simple  way,  that  it  is 
<br/>important to live a healthy lifestyle. Whatever disease that we get, the severity of it may have an 
<br/>impact on our outcomes and the management and the treatment that is available.  All these three play 
<br/>an important role, and I have said lately that healthy lifestyle is important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Another supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have had your supplementary question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, whatever healthy lifestyle we lead, you and I will still have the same 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>problem, we still lose hair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  A  supplementary  question,  has  the  Ministry 
<br/>endorsed the Food and Nutrition Security Policy?  If so, how will that help in our fight against the 
<br/>NCDs?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  that  question.    The 
<br/>National Food and Nutrition Committee play an important role in terms of all the nutritional policies 
<br/>that we have, including some of those things that I talked about, for example, – the </span><span>My Kana</span><span> App.   
<br/>You have asked specifically in terms of the policy around nutrition and food, off the top of my head 
<br/>I cannot remember if we have fully endorsed it.  Oh, but I have been reminded that it is with the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture.

<div><span>Tourism Industry’s Progress – Reopening of Borders 
<br/>(Question No. 45/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on the progress made by the tourism industry since the reopening of 
<br/>borders? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tuisawau for the question.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>think I had answered a similar question on Tuesday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Sir, we have already set sail and basically, we are not looking back.  The ultimate 
<br/>aim, Mr. Speaker, of opening the international borders has been and will continue to be about creating 
<br/>opportunities  for  ordinary  Fijians  and  restoring  the  livelihoods  for  thousands  of  Fijians  who,  for 
<br/>years, have actually depended on the tourism sector.  I think we all know that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was also made possible through well-established partnerships and enhanced health and 
<br/>safety  protocols  that  we  have  put  in  place,  and  an  effective  vaccination  coverage,  and  that  is  so 
<br/>important, Mr. Speaker. The careFIJI commitment programme has contributed immensely to lifting 
<br/>visitor confidence also, and gradually restoring safe mobility for the tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our visitor numbers, Mr. Speaker, in the last two months are indicative of how resilient the 
<br/>industry has been in solidifying for the re-opening whilst not everyone actually opened in December, 
<br/>the overwhelming majority of our stakeholders were ready to safely re-open.  The CFC has actually 
<br/>given us greater confidence to resume travel whilst ensuring the health and safety of our travellers 
<br/>remain paramount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To-date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have over 2,200 businesses that are registered under the CFC 
<br/>compared to 1,741 in December 2021. This is an increase of 26 per cent.  Other notable achievements, 
<br/>we have 23,226 visitors were received in the month of December which was 73.5 per cent of the total 
<br/>arrivals for 2021, 92 per cent of the total December arrivals were mainly from our key source markets, 
<br/>that was from Australia and the United States of America.  The month of December also, as I had 
<br/>mentioned  and  alluded  to  earlier  on  during  the  week,  we  collected  the  highest  monthly  revenue 
<br/>collection of $190 million by the Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Services (FRCS) since Fiji’s first COVID-
<br/>19 case in March 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we constantly review also and update our travel partner countries and now 
<br/></span><span>we  have  57  countries  added  to  this  particular  list  and  the  most  recent  addition  is  being  People’s 
<br/>Republic of China and Hong Kong.  In terms of forecast of tourism numbers for March and April 
<br/>particularly  the  lower  seasons  in  our  tourism  calendar,  we  also  almost  recorded  50  per  cent  of 
<br/>December  arrival  figures  on  the  books  already,  so  more  tourism  properties,  accommodation 
<br/>properties will also be opened for full operations from March and onwards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the course of opening up in late December and January, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were 
<br/>challenged with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but we were not deterred and remained 
<br/>steadfast about our re-opening plans and though we had some resource constraints and exhausted 
<br/>staff, we learnt how to best deal with Omicron variant and tested all our COVID safe protocols.  Now, 
<br/>we know better how to deal with adverse situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you must remember </span><span>TC Cody </span><span>also inflicted its fair share of 
<br/>challenges on the tourism industry, but despite all of these hurdles, we continued to remain resilient.

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  were  stories  of  fire  trucks  and  4  wheel  drives  providing  transportation  for  our  tourists  in 
<br/>flooded roads to catch their flights and hotel staff transporting people and members of the public, 
<br/>assisting in a way possible, but that is just us being Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were some issues in regards to non-compliance also.  We have had 
<br/>that with respect to our COVID-19 protocols, in the down time also our COVID-19 safe ambassadors 
<br/>have conducted surprise monitoring visits and address these non-compliance issues.  The programme 
<br/>was introduced last year and will continue to be instrumental to advocate adherence to the COVID 
<br/>safe measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are returning to normalcy as recently announced by the honourable Acting Prime Minister 
<br/>and a number of COVID-19 related restrictions, including the national curfew, removal of restrictions 
<br/>on social gatherings, allowing businesses except high risk natured ones and public services vehicles 
<br/>to operate in full capacity and the lifting of the mandatory requirement on the careFIJI app, the QR 
<br/>code and the vaccination check too.  We have eased entry requirements also in terms of COVID-19 
<br/>testing for travellers from travel partner countries, now all travellers departing from travel partner 
<br/>countries have an added option of providing a rapid antigen test 24 hours prior to departure as an 
<br/>accepted testing requirement.  This will make holiday cost lesser for our visitors and consequently 
<br/>makes Fiji a convenient destination to travel to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these efforts have generally brought about optimism in the tourism industry and promising 
<br/>return  to  normalcy  in  our  daily  lives;  a  breath  of  fresh  air,  weight  of  confidence,  a  reduction  in 
<br/>administrative burden and one last thing to worry about, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I basically close by just saying that with Government works also, we have had tremendous 
<br/>amount of consultation with all the stakeholders - Tourism Fiji, hoteliers, the national airline, the 
<br/>transport  or  experienced  providers,  Ministry  of  Health  and  all  our  Health  Officials  and  we  will 
<br/>continue  to  do  so  to  protect  and  promote  the  best  interest  of  the  industry.    I  thank  you  for  the 
<br/>opportunity to answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- A supplementary question.  Thank you honourable Minister for 
<br/>the update, noting in your update you had mentioned 23,200 tourists in December. My question is 
<br/>related to the projections in the Budget Supplement 2022 - 268,317 and in 2023 - 715,511.  Could 
<br/>you please enlighten the House as to whether these projections are realistic or not and why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I leave you to answer that but that is not within the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>range of this.  You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir, but I think the honourable Member should realise these 
<br/>are projections.  These projections are not just plucked out of the air, they would have been done 
<br/>with a little bit of research.  As we  know, the template that we work of changes on a daily basis 
<br/>because of COVID.  So there may be some variations but those projections that were made, were 
<br/>made with some research. When Ministry of Economy does this, it does not just pluck out of thin air.

<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>First Home Buyers Programme?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for this question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the First Home Owner Initiative was introduced by Government in 2014 to 
<br/>increase  the  home  ownership  opportunities  for  low  and  middle  income  earning  Fijians.    The 
<br/>Programme started in 2014 with a $10,000 assistance to Fijians with annual household income of 
<br/>$50,000 or below who were constructing their first home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018, Sir, this was further expanded by increasing the first home grant to $15,000 and also 
<br/>introducing the first land purchase grant of $10,000 for those Fijian households purchasing their first 
<br/>residential block of land.  This, of course, is a grant. Since inception in 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir, first 
<br/>home ownership initiative we had assisted over 3,400 Fijian households to a tune of $36 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2020-2021 Financial Year, we made a bold decision to increase the 
<br/>value of the grant to up to $30,000.  This was, of course, done with the intention to help people to 
<br/>own their own homes quickly and encourage them because we see the rate of home ownership, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in Fiji is actually quite low comparatively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was also helped because in the COVID situation, if you had more people 
<br/>wanting to build homes it will create economic activity.  So the current parameters, Sir, are that if a 
<br/>household earns less than $50,000 a year and they want to construct their first home, they are entitled 
<br/>to a $30,000 grant. They have to go through the banking system or housing authority.  If they want 
<br/>to purchase their first home, they are given a $15,000 grant because obviously we want to increase 
<br/>the stock of homes.  Nonetheless there are still assisted if they want to purchase their first home.  If 
<br/>you earn more than $50,000 but less than $100,000, you actually qualify for a $20,000 package if 
<br/>you apply and you are building your first home and $5,000 for purchasing your first home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020-2021 Financial Year, a total of 433 Fijian households benefitted 
<br/>from  the  first  home  grant  with  a  total  Government  investment  of  $7.5  million.  In  the  2021-2022 
<br/>National  Budget,  Sir,  a  total  of  $4  million  was  allocated.  As  of  date,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  total 
<br/>allocation has been paid out. The demand was so high. In fact, with the additional $400,000 currently 
<br/>being vired to the programme from the First Land Home Programme.  A total of 213 Fijian families 
<br/>have benefitted in the current year from this programme, the total pay-out to date is $4.345 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  is  really  interesting,  Sir,  is  that  out  of  the  213  successful  applicants  a  total  of  130 
<br/>households  received  the  grant  to  construct  their  first  home,  value  of  $3.4  million  grant,  and  83 
<br/>households received the grant to purchase their first homes of about $900,000.  Further, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, 145 of the households that benefitted from the $50,000 and below income category, $3.4 million 
<br/></span><span>and the balance 68 with the high income bracket of $0.935 million.  Interesting statistics, Sir, to note 
<br/>that 47 per cent of the applicants or 100 applicants who have received the grant assistance to-date are 
<br/>from the Western Division.  A total of $2.1 million was received by these households and out of this, 
<br/>64  applicants  were  constructing  their  first  homes  creating  much  needed  economic  activity,  in 
<br/>particular, in the Western Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to let you know the total value of the loans that they drew down, in 
<br/>2020-2021  Financial  Year,  433  successful  applicants  secured  home  loans  to  a  total  value  of  $58 
<br/>million, and almost eight fold of economic activities compared to the grant pay-out of $7.5 million.  
<br/>Of course, this  creates  a lot of  economic  activity. We have received some more applications, we 
<br/>actually have not stopped receiving applications.  We have received a further 198 applications to-
<br/>date  which  awaits  payment  of  $4.3  million,  which  we  hope  to  facilitate,  Mr.  Speaker,  of  which, 
<br/>interestingly  enough,  out  of  198,  133  actually  are  for  construction  and  the  balance  65  were  for 
<br/>purchase of homes.  Those are the figures on that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>739  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  that,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  has 
<br/>assisted 26 households in the current year of the total pay-out of $260 for the purchase of their first 
<br/>land. We also provide $5,000 to assist those people who want to rebuild their homes destroyed in 
<br/>accidental fires, of course, not deliberate fires and up to $5,000 to retrofit homes to meet the needs 
<br/>of disabled Fijians.  So if you have a disabled person in your home, perhaps, they need railings in the 
<br/>home or they need a ramp, I am talking about internally in the home, we actually retro fit the homes 
<br/>up to $5,000.  We have received 1,200 applications for retro fitting of which we found that 65 were 
<br/>identified to be eligible for that and they are currently being facilitated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Acting Prime Minister inform 
<br/>Parliament if there are plans to assist those living in informal settlements to acquire some form of 
<br/>legal tenure to the land and, therefore, benefit from the first home buyers programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not quite understand the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Can the honourable Acting Prime Minister inform Parliament if 
<br/>there are plans to assist those living in informal settlements to acquire some form of legal tenure to 
<br/>the land and benefit from the first home buyers programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are actually about 40 sites we have 
<br/>identified as informal settlements that need to be in fact formalised.  A lot of work has been going 
<br/>on.  Honourable Kumar when she was there, she talked a lot about that.  So there are people who are 
<br/>living in </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangement in lot of places, and some of them have been living there for about 
<br/>30 years to 50 years, so they pay on a monthly basis to the landowner in that particular area or an 
<br/>individual.    So  what  we  have  done,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  identified  these  areas,  we  have 
<br/>negotiated with the landowners and iTLTB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  currently  are  now  paying,  even  though  the  land  has  not  been  developed,  the  lease 
<br/>payments for all those people who live in those informal areas.  So they are not paying anything, they 
<br/>have been identified.  Of course, we have now developed some of them, they have already started 
<br/>works, some of them are at their design stage.  There are some issues that we want to resolve because, 
<br/>for example, the </span><span>vakavanua </span><span>arrangement are not necessarily in one nice little square block, they are 
<br/>all over  the place.    Also we  hope  to  bring  some  laws to  Parliament  where once  Government  has 
<br/>identified to develop an informal settlement or area in </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangement, we have got the right 
<br/>amount being paid to the landowners, we want to be able to have the ability to realign homes.  One 
<br/>of the problems, I think, it is in Caubati in one of the areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mamas Place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mamas  Place,  where  we  are  paying  on  their  behalf,  but 
<br/>people do not want to move their homes, so how can we build roads.  You have a house here, one 
<br/>house there, one house there, so we have to build roads in this fashion, very narrow.  So we want to 
<br/>be able to have the ability and say to them, “Look, will get you a 99-year lease.  We are paying the 
<br/>lease for you at the moment, you will get a 99-year lease which you can then build your nice concrete 
<br/>home but you have to have the ability to move so we can do proper subdivision”, to be able to put 
<br/>the sewerage line, to be able to put wide enough roads because in some of the subdivisions, the road 
<br/>is as narrow from here to there, that is it. Two vehicles cannot even pass.  So that is what we intend 
<br/>to do, Sir, but we obviously have about 40 sites that have been identified where we can give them 
<br/>long term security of tenure.

<div><span>Safety of Children and Teachers in Schools 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 47/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Local 
<br/>Government  update  Parliament  on  the  protocols  in  place  to  ensure  the  safety  of 
<br/>children and teachers in schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for his question. 
<br/>Sir, COVID-19 is a disruptor. We all know that the COVID pandemic has not only disrupted the 
<br/>education sector worldwide, but every sector of the economy.  With almost two years of living with 
<br/>the pandemic, COVID is not going anywhere any time soon.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, life cannot 
<br/>stop because of COVID. We have to learn to live with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, returning to school has taken on new meaning and a new set of worries for 
<br/>teachers, parents and guardians.  Schools have to balance the educational, social and emotional needs 
<br/>of their students, along with stringent safety requirements to protect our students and teachers during 
<br/>this pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry, working very closely with the Ministry of Health and Medical 
<br/>Services, has undertaken a considerable amount of work to keep our schools safe.  In August 2021, 
<br/>the Ministry developed a COVID Safe Schools Reopening Guidelines that outline the multi-layered 
<br/>mitigation  measures  and  the  responsibilities  of  Head  of  Schools,  teachers  and  parents,  to  ensure 
<br/>COVID-safe measures are implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Teachers  and  Schools  Heads  underwent  vigorous  COVID-safe  reopening  training 
<br/>programmes.  We are very grateful to the competent international organisations, such as WHO and 
<br/>UNICEF,  for  their  advice  and  guidance,  particularly  advising  us  on  research  data  and  signs  to 
<br/>strategize better in reopening schools for our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education worked closely with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, 
<br/>to  ensure  all  schools  have  COVID-safe  measures  based  on  the  implementation  of  multilayers  of 
<br/>mitigation measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mitigation  measures  included;  temperature  screening,  correct  and  consistent  mask  use, 
<br/>physical distancing as much as possible, increase ventilation in classrooms, hand-washing with soap, 
<br/></span><span>respiratory etiquette, staying at home when sick and cleaning and disinfection of school spaces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, all teachers and ancillary staff throughout Fiji are fully vaccinated, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Head of Schools started preparing the schools from October 2021 by using the Free Education 
<br/>Grant  to  buy  consumables,  prepare  signage,  clean  and  repair  classrooms  and  compounds.  The 
<br/>Ministry  also  distributed  cleaning  agents,  masks,  sanitizers  and  thermal  guns  received  from  the 
<br/>private sector, NGOs and from our development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all schools were inspected by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>and Ministry of Education Officials, to ensure schools met the required COVID-safe standard.  Sick 
<br/>bays  are  set  up  in  schools  for  students  who  may  present  symptoms  of  COVID.  Clear  canteen 
<br/>guidelines were developed and COVID-safe messages have been displayed in schools.  In fact, just 
<br/>last week, there was another round of school inspections carried out by the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical  Services  Officials,  to  ensure  schools  were  ready  to  receive  ECE  up  to  Year  7  students.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>741  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Schools have ensured that classrooms are well ventilated, new fence were installed, hand-washing 
<br/>facilities and sanitizers are available for teachers and students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have personally visited 60 schools around Fiji and have seen the level of preparedness at 
<br/>each school, and I must commend the teachers, Head of Schools, school management team, parents 
<br/>and guardians for this great effort. During my recent visit to schools, I was taken through the COVID 
<br/>safety protocols at each school, which I found well in order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important for us to understand that COVID-safe measures require multi-
<br/>layered approach.  All of these measures complement each other to ensure school facilities are safe 
<br/>for our children to attend schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Opposition and teacher unions have selectively raved on about 
<br/>physical distancing, they know very well that COVID-safe measures require multi-layered approach.  
<br/>We have said it so many times and so have the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, UNICEF 
<br/>and WHO.  They do this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to create fear amongst our parents and guardians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate that evidence continues to show that schools are not the main 
<br/>driver of transmission and when mitigation measures are in place and consistently applied, children 
<br/>are less likely to contract COVID-19 in schools than in the community settings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Globally, whilst sporadic COVID-19 cases have been reported in schools, relative to the level 
<br/>of  community  transmissions,  schools  have  not  been  identified  as  super  spreading  settings.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, our teachers, parents and school management committees, together with the guidance 
<br/>of Ministry of Health and Medical Services and with our development partners, we have put in the 
<br/>hard yards to ensure safe reopening of schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, those who question whether schools are safe for our children, I ask them, how safe 
<br/>are  children  in  their  communities,  at  community  functions,  at  the  supermarket,  in  cinemas,  at 
<br/>municipal markets, in places of worship?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Can the honourable Minister enlighten the House on the disease 
<br/>outbreak at Ratu Kadavulevu School which saw a busload and truckload of sick students being sent 
<br/>home arriving home late last night without prior knowledge of their parents?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what speculation does.  It started with Mr. 
<br/>Rabuka and he made a statement in the newspaper that RKS students had COVID-19, parents were 
<br/></span><span>concerned.   Our data showed that there were 10 students who were not feeling well, they went to 
<br/></span><span>hospital and they were simply feverish, so there was no such thing as they had COVID-19.  There 
<br/>was no COVID-19 at that time.  So, it does not mean if someone has got fever-like symptoms, they 
<br/>are COVID-19 positive, it is nothing like that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Student Turnout – Reopening of Schools 
<br/>(Question No. 48/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government update Parliament on the student turnout after the reopening of schools?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  thank honourable Adimaitoga for her question.  I 
<br/>am pleased to inform Parliament that student attendance since the reopening of school has been good, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>despite so much of negativity spread by certain political parties, teacher unions and other critics over 
<br/>the  past  months.    They  created  anxiety  and  worry  amongst  our  parents  and  guardians  as  well  as 
<br/>students who were eager to get back to schools.  Clearly, they do not care about the education of our 
<br/>children and their future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  student  attendance  from  Year  8  to  Year13  in  the  first  week  of  January 
<br/>averaged round 60 per cent at the peak of second wave.  Since schools reopened on 24th January, 
<br/>attendance for Year 8 students was 73 per cent on average.  For secondary school, it has been 70 per 
<br/>cent on average.  We should note that the week of 1</span><span>st</span><span> February, Year 13 students began their exams 
<br/>and study break started for Year 12. Attendance for primary schools was at 80 per cent and secondary 
<br/>schools at 70 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from Monday this week, all our students from Early Childhood Education 
<br/>(ECE)  to  Year  11  are  back  in  school,  except  the Western  Division  where  the  floods  necessitated 
<br/>school closure.  We are seeing average attendance for ECE at 70 per cent and primary at 72 per cent, 
<br/>secondary school attendance was at 69 per cent for last four days.  Hopefully, from next week, we 
<br/>will have good attendance from our Year 12 students for their exams and Year 13 also resuming to 
<br/>sit for their remaining papers.  We also expect ECE to Year 11 students from the Western Division 
<br/>to return to classes from next Monday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, three weeks ago, we ran a rapid assessment survey in collaboration with 
<br/>UNICEF to obtain feedback from parents on reopening of schools.  We received 10,000 responses.  
<br/>Around 60 per cent have clearly said they will send their children to school, 20 per cent were not sure 
<br/>and 20 per cent said no.  This is a strong indication that parents want their children to go back to 
<br/>school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding teacher attendance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it ranged from 83 to 92 per cent since schools 
<br/>reopened for teachers.  My Ministry had planned in advance to deal with teacher absenteeism as a 
<br/>result of COVID-19 cases.  We have a list of 100 registered teachers in various districts, ready to 
<br/>report to schools if the need arises.  We also had the option of using primary school teachers since 
<br/>Years 1 – 7 students were home.  As we have seen, even in the worst time, there was no need for this.

<div><span>Ministry of Education - Amended Curriculum 
<br/>(Question No. 49/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO T.V. KEPA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Local 
<br/></span><span>Government update Parliament on the amended curriculum to ensure that students do 
<br/>not lose out in achieving the minimum standard to advance further? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Kepa for her question.  During 
<br/>the period of school  closure from  April to  November last  year, teaching was conducted remotely 
<br/>using a variety of methods  including; worksheets, educational programmes on Walesi Channel, radio 
<br/>broadcast, Zoom, Learning Hub and other digital platforms.  This occurred amidst the challenges of 
<br/>remote learning, such as access to internet, availability of digital devices, connectivity, locality and 
<br/>reach of students in the remote and very remote areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Facing these challenges, it was not possible to manage the complete coverage of the syllabus 
<br/>so  realignment  of  the  curriculum  became  imperative.  The  Ministry,  having  learnt  from  the 
<br/>experiences  of  2020,  decided  to  carry  out  realignment  of  the  curriculum  in  both,  primary  and 
<br/>secondary  schools.    This  was  carried  out  systematically,  keeping  in  mind  that  the  core  body  of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>knowledge is not compromised.  This meant, a careful look at the continuation of concept knowledge 
<br/>and addressing knowledge gaps as students progressed from one level to the next.  I want to thank 
<br/>the Permanent Secretary and her team at the Ministry because they did a very systematic work when 
<br/>they were involved in the curriculum realignment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had to be mindful that different students were learning at different pace 
<br/>and the best people to gauge the pace of learning are the teachers.  We had meetings with all primary 
<br/>and secondary heads of schools and took them through the process used in curriculum realignment 
<br/>and explained the need for teachers to work closely with the students, so that they are aware of their 
<br/>students learning.  Majority of the teachers received completed worksheets on a regular basis to mark, 
<br/>so they were aware of the learning that was taking place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when students returned to school, teachers were given a set of questions 
<br/>that they could use to gauge the learning gaps.  Using these, the teachers were able to understand the 
<br/>learning gaps of their students and have designed the lessons to cover these gaps.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  decision  to  have  an  extra  term  was  to  allow  time  for  catch  up  and 
<br/>undertake revisions before students progressed to the next level.  During this time, teachers will carry 
<br/>out some form of assessment and use this to inform teacher to plan their teaching in the new academic 
<br/>year to address knowledge gap. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this is working well, the fact remains, science practical and projects 
<br/>have been compromised, but clearly this was unavoidable.  We have to face the fact that last year 
<br/>was by no means a normal year and it is pointless to assume that complete learning would take place 
<br/>given the circumstances.  This problem is not unique to us in Fiji, all we have to do is look at the 
<br/>global situation to see that this is a global problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a comprehensive study by UNESCO, UNICEF and WHO on the state of 
<br/>the global education crisis, a pathway to recovery states that school closures have affected more than 
<br/>1.6  billion  learners  globally.    The  impact  on  learning  loss  has  been  more  significant  in  younger 
<br/>students from rural and marginalised areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must look ahead, learn from the experiences of the past two years and 
<br/>prepare for the future.  The Ministry continues to build resources that can be used if such situation 
<br/>arises.  We have appointed a Manager e-learning who has joined the Ministry this week and will be 
<br/>responsible for creating e-learning resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that we have been talking to three universities to provide 
<br/></span><span>extra support to the first year students when they start tertiary studies.  All have agreed and have 
<br/>already designed programme to provide that extra support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for her response and also for the work that she is doing for the Ministry of Education, it is 
<br/>not easy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what type of monitoring mechanism is there for ongoing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assessment in the effectiveness of this curriculum realignment that you have spoken about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that the teachers, first they 
<br/>were given questions and through those questions, they will be able to monitor the learning gaps and 
<br/>the second step is the assessment that they will be carrying out.  Through that assessment, again they 
<br/>will be able to find out whether the curriculum that was realigned is really producing that result or

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not, but above all, we all have to accept the fact that there has been learning loss which we will not 
<br/>be able to recover ever and I think we have to live with that.

<div><span>Update – Civil Service Reforms 
<br/>(Question No. 50/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament of the civil 
<br/>service reforms in place to improve services to members of public? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question. I think the first point of call really should be the Constitution and if we look at Section 123, 
<br/>it says under Public Service, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>high standards of professionalism, including professional ethics and integrity 
<br/>prompt and faithful implementation of Government policies and administration of laws 
<br/>being free from corruption 
<br/>efficient, effective and economic use of public resources 
<br/>prompt response to requests and questions from the public, and delivery of service to the 
<br/>public, in a manner that is respectful, effective, impartial, fair, and equitable 
<br/>accountability for administrative conduct 
<br/>transparency, including –  
<br/>i.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>ii.</span><span> </span><span>prompt, complete and candid reporting to Parliament, as required by law 
<br/>cultivation  of  good  human  resource  management  and  career  development  practices,  to 
<br/>maximise human potential; and 
<br/>recruitment and promotion based on – 
<br/>i.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>ii.</span><span> </span><span>ability, education, experience and other characteristics of merit.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>timely, accurate disclosure of information to the public; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objectivity, impartiality and fair competition; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been carrying out a number of reforms within the Civil Service 
<br/>starting  off  with  the  Open  Merit  Recruitment  and  Selection  (OMRS)  but  also  with  various  other 
<br/>initiatives. One of them, of course, we have been seeing in Parliament this week as to how we can 
<br/></span><span>improve processes, licensed periods from one year to three years or five years which provides, of 
<br/></span><span>course, better services to members of the public, and also to removing  bottlenecks.  There is a lot of 
<br/>duplication that was taking place, there is still some duplication taking place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we mentioned, the Ministers are working with the Permanent Secretaries to see how we 
<br/>can unlock the bureaucratic bottlenecks that we do have. We have opened a number of Government 
<br/>centres  where  people  can  go  to.  We  now  have  Births,  Deaths  and  Marriages  (BDM)  offices,  for 
<br/>example, throughout  Fiji  as far as Rotuma,  Lau  and various other places.  Only a few  years ago, 
<br/>BDM offices only existed in Lautoka, Suva and Labasa. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues that 
<br/>we  have  dealt  with,  we  have  toll  free  lines  now,  people  can  make  complaints,  we  also  set  up  a 
<br/>transparent  accountable  digital  feedback tool where people can actually  go now to  the digitalFIJI 
<br/>platform, you can lodge complaints, you have the email addresses of the Permanent Secretaries and 
<br/>Ministers and phone numbers they can get in touch with.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>745  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course at  the  rudimentary level,  we have these  </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions.  The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister is the one who leads the charge in that respect.  Ministers do that now 
<br/>whenever we go and of course, the different ministries also have those.  There are a number of Civil 
<br/>Servants who go beyond the call of duty, who actually are fantastic in their responses but then at the 
<br/>same time there are some who are actually quite rude.  They believe that because they are in a position 
<br/>of  authority,  they  can  treat  the  ordinary  citizen  in  whichever  way  they  like.  I  mean,  we  see  the 
<br/>language that they have, calling someone, </span><span>lewa</span><span> come and do this, </span><span>bhaini</span><span> come and do that, whatever 
<br/>it is or I do not have to respond to you or if you ring up the wrong department, they do not necessarily 
<br/>handhold  you  to  say,  “look,  you  have  called  the  wrong  number,  let  me  transfer  you  to  the  right 
<br/>department.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is was interesting in Singapore a few years ago, they made that actually an objective. So if 
<br/>I rang up, for example, Ministry of Forestry but really I should have rung up Ministry of Environment, 
<br/>the Forestry person would not get off the phone until they know, that I have been transferred to the 
<br/>right person in the Ministry of Forestry or they will get them to make a phone call and call you back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are about to launch a new Customer Service Guideline for the whole of 
<br/>Civil Service where it consolidates all aspects of customer service delivery processes and activities. 
<br/>As I highlighted the other day, pretty basic things like calling someone Mr. Poasa or Mr. Prasad, Sir 
<br/>or Madam - goes a long way. It makes the citizen feel that you are giving them that particular level 
<br/>of importance, that they are actually your customer, your client as opposed to them coming up to you 
<br/>and kowtowing to you and indeed being obsequious  to you, just in case so you can get your work 
<br/>done.  That culture needs to change.  Many people, for example, we have had discussions in Fiji, if 
<br/>you go and see a doctor, some doctors are very good and other doctors would not necessarily explain 
<br/>to you what the medicine is for. If you go to a hospital, they will not call the patient a Sir or Madam 
<br/>or by their surname or Mr. or Mrs.  That needs to change - that culture needs to change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular Service Guideline, we are actually rolling out and we are currently ensuring 
<br/>that it will be rolled out through Public Service Commission because once we get it through PSC, 
<br/>that  means  the  Permanent  Secretaries  who  are  employed  by  PSC  will  be  held  accountable  for 
<br/>ensuring that their particular or respective Ministries roll out these services and so we can then be 
<br/>able to improve the level of service to members of the public.  In a nutshell and in consideration of 
<br/>time, Sir, that is the response to the honourable Member’s question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, question time is over.  We will take a 20-minute
