<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI AIRPORTS 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament debates  the Review of the  Fiji  Airports  2018  – 2019  Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report which was tabled on 20</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports is a fully Government-owned Commercial 
<br/></span><span>Company  which  was  established  on  12</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  1999,  under  the  Public  Enterprises  Act  1996.    It 
<br/>operates 15 airports in Fiji, including the Nadi and Nausori Airports, together with 13 other domestic 
<br/>airports located on islands scattered over Fiji’s maritime zones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airports also provides Air Traffic Management Services within Nadi Flight Information 
<br/>Region which includes the sovereign air spaces of Tuvalu, New Caledonia, Kiribati and Vanuatu.  In 
<br/>the period under review, Fiji Airports received the Airports Council International Level 3 Airport 
<br/>Carbon Accreditation for the Nadi International Airport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In their response to the Committee, the Executive Management of Fiji Airports assured us of 
<br/>the  continued  development  of  new  energy  efficiency  initiatives  and  envisioned  extending  this 
<br/>initiative to the Nausori International Airport upon return to normalcy following the impacts of the 
<br/>COVID-19  pandemic.    This  initiative  is  part  of  the  capital  project  plan  which  includes  terminal 
<br/>upgrades to the Nausori Airport to commence in 2024, which will include scope for energy efficient 
<br/>responses  for  carbon  reduction.    The  Committee  was  also  informed  that  the  $64  million  Nausori 
<br/>project would be completed before the end of August 2021.  The runway has been reoriented to its 
<br/>full width and length as per the final design and the instrument landing system was commissioned in 
<br/></span><span>May 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other highlights include; Fiji Airports being bestowed with the Excellence in Service Award 
<br/>and the Prime Minister’s International Business Award in 2018 and 2019 respectively.  Furthermore, 
<br/>the upgraded Nadi International Airport attained Skytrax recognition in March 2018 and represented 
<br/>an amazing repositioning for the airport to be accredited top 10 of the World’s Most Improved, which 
<br/>is a milestone achievement of Fiji Airports.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Chairperson for his motion.  Honourable Members, the floor is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir, for the opportunity 
<br/>and  I  thank  the  honourable  Chairman  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs.    Being  a 
<br/>Committee Member myself, I must, first of all, thank the Fiji Airports Management and Board for 
<br/>their written submission to our questions and queries that has allowed the Committee to compile the 
<br/>Report that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>473 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is beforehand.  With respect to the Report being debated, I would like to point out that even though 
<br/>it is the 2018-2019 Report, the submission from the Fiji Airport mentioned the challenges during that 
<br/>period but more-so challenges in relation to COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the challenges with regards to COVID-19 for Fiji Airports were noted by 
<br/>the Committee and it affected their service delivery and revenue stream.  As noted in the Report, we 
<br/>must commend the  Management as they took  the lead role with  30 per cent  pay  cut  and also  the 
<br/>Board Chairman with 100 percent pay cut.  There are other measures that were put in place by Fiji 
<br/>Airports that allowed it to, at least, continue with their services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, with regards to the capital projects for the ones that were due to start, they had allowed 
<br/>that to go on and we note that the other major capital projects were put on hold and that is to be 
<br/>expected, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though the challenges with regards to COVID-19 were raised by Fiji 
<br/>Airports, one of the recurring issue or challenge that is noted in the observation and areas of concern 
<br/>by the Committee is the loss making of the outer island airports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have come to note that this is unavoidable and it will be there in every Report and that is 
<br/></span><span>why our recommendation will always be there as well, that as part of its social responsibility, the 
<br/>Government must take the lead role and support Fiji Airports in the maintenance and upgrade of the 
<br/>domestic airstrips in the outer islands.  Fiji Airports continue to subsidise domestic travel and for the 
<br/>current COVID-19 challenges, domestic changes be reviewed at an appropriate time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Member of the Standing Committee, there were challenges faced while 
<br/>compiling the Report because less time was given and we were not able to do site visitations.  With 
<br/>the easing of restrictions, we hope that we will, again, be allowed to go on site visitations to actually 
<br/>see the progress of the various capital projects that are ongoing with Fiji Airports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Just before I start, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a message here from the 
<br/>villagers of Malomalo to the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources, they are asking about their water, if they can be connected to the water that 
<br/>runs through their land from Namuka to the Golf Course at Natadola and they have been asking about 
<br/>this since 2015.  Honourable Minister, that is the request from the villagers of Malomalo.  That is the 
<br/>area where FijiFirst had spent $45 million on golf for the rich and famous, neglecting the villages 
<br/>around the area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the recommendations is that, as part of its social responsibility, the 
<br/>Government must take the lead role and support Fiji Airports in the maintenance and upgrade on 
<br/>island domestic airstrips.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  past,  we  have  spoken  about  bringing  in  a  suitable  aircraft  into 
<br/>Savusavu, given the critical mass of tourism in that area. Savusavu has got some great resorts but the 
<br/>airline capacity is still a limiting factor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ATR42 now lands in Labasa.  We should also upgrade the airport at Savusavu to also 
<br/>accommodate the ATR.  I know it has been there for quite some time, we have seen a number of 
<br/>proposals, but I think we must make the decision to land an ATR in Savusavu.  Like I said, it has the 
<br/>critical mass, it will help tourism.  Savusavu in the North is very famous in the American market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is my short contribution for tourism and also to improve the services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the air capacity into the North, especially into an important centre like Savusavu.

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know it is nearly 7.30 p.m., so I am 
<br/>going  to  get  straight  to  the  point  in  my  contribution  on  the  Report  prepared  by  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee as it reviewed the 2018-2019 Annual Report for Fiji Airports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Committee  for  their  bipartisan  and  robust  interrogations  as  detailed  in  the 
<br/>appendices.  I note the seven recommendations as placed under the thematic issues of Loss Making 
<br/>Outer Island Airports, Fiji Airports Master Plan on Hold and Impact of COVID-19 on Fiji Airports 
<br/>Operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note in particular, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Committee was very proactive and questioned 
<br/>Fiji  Airports  on  the  lateness  of  their  annual  report,  which  was  adequately  responded  to  by  Fiji 
<br/>Airports, stating that the delay in the 2018 Financial Statements was due to the to-ing and fro-ing 
<br/>with Government on the confusion between a Cabinet circular and a Ministry of Public Enterprises 
<br/>directive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very serious and unfortunate that this manner of bureaucratic confusion 
<br/>should  hamper  Government  Commercial  Companies  like  Fiji  Airports  and  Government  Statutory 
<br/>Organisations from complying with a legal requirement to submit their annual reports to Parliament 
<br/></span><span>at  the  prescribed  timeframe.    Yet,  on  the  total  flip  side,  the  head  of  another  statutory  entity  with 
<br/></span><span>hugely delayed annual reports and this is the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) 
<br/>through its CEO, Mr. Joel Abraham, can somehow find the time in his busy schedule to make brazen 
<br/>political comments.  So, I reckon he should just decide which hat he wears.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this revelation from Fiji Airports in the Committee Report as to the 
<br/>bureaucratic barriers causing confusion and contributing to delays in annual report submissions, as 
<br/>of today on the Parliament website, only two annual reports for 2021 are up to date and they have 
<br/>been tabled in this august House.  So, I take this opportunity to commend these two organisations:  
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General and the Fiji National Provident Fund.  These two organisations 
<br/>understand what accountability means, they know how to be grateful to taxpayers, and they are not 
<br/>bringing scorn and disrepute to their line Ministers in an election year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  take  this  opportunity  to  gratefully  commend  the  Auditor-
<br/>General, Mr. Ajay Nand, and his Team for their unwavering steadfastness in presenting audit reports 
<br/>to this House without fear or favour.  Mr. Ajay Nand has continued and excelled in the tradition of 
<br/>impartial  excellence at  the Office of the Auditor-General.  It  is  disgusting that he has become  yet 
<br/>another  victim  of  self-righteous  and  combative  behaviour  by  Government  functionaries  and  self-
<br/></span><span>seeking flatterers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  almost  like,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  may,  a  domestic  violence  scenario  where  the 
<br/>perpetrators are allowed to continue with criminal behaviour even though a zero tolerance, no drop 
<br/>policy by the Police exists.  But circling back to the substantive elements of this Report, I am stunned 
<br/>that  robust  due  diligence  processes  in  an  organisation  like  this  can  lead  to  bad  debt  carried  by 
<br/>taxpayers  where  a  company  called  Pacific  Affordable  Homes  did  not  honour  its  approximately 
<br/>$124,000 contract to build a new terminal at Savusavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am further stunned that Virgin Australia then owed $700,000 to Fiji Airports for landing 
<br/>fees triggering its bad debt collection process.  I hope that this has, by now, been resolved.  I also 
<br/>note from the Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that China Railway No. 5, the principal contractor for the 
<br/>$64 million Nausori Airport Runway extension funded by Fiji Airports has project delays due to the 
<br/>COVID-19 border closures affecting the China Railway No. 5 workers, and I also hope that these 
<br/>delays have either been resolved or at the very least being mitigated. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>475 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I further note the Committee also questioned the once-a-week flight to Rotuma 
<br/>and whether their frequency had changed.  It is quite astonishing that Fiji Airports candidly states 
<br/>that despite requests to Fiji Airways to increase flights to Rotuma, the frequency of these flights was 
<br/>at the total discretion of Fiji Airways. Mr. Speaker, how many times must we, as elected legislators, 
<br/>insist on Fiji Airways to show some gratitude to taxpayers and table their Annual Reports here in this 
<br/>House instead of hiding them away in the Registrar of Companies Office? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, permit  me to  add some concern about  Fiji  Airports labelling of loss making 
<br/>outer island airports as it headlined in this Report.   I would urge Fiji Airports to frame it in a more 
<br/>acceptable narrative as it implies that outer islands are second-class burdens, forgetting that they too 
<br/>are taxpayers. We all know that these airports and flights do not generate profits, especially during 
<br/>COVID but this is the social contract of this Government and any Government for that matter, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  part  of  the  balancing  act  that  I  spoke  about  yesterday.  If  perhaps  there  is  more  rigid 
<br/>cohesion and a shared vision between the efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture, the work described 
<br/>earlier  today  by  honourable  Koya  and  his  team  and  the  efforts  of  rural  development  and  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>affairs, it is not impossible, Mr. Speaker, despite COVID-19 to harness innovative thinking and a 
<br/></span><span>shared vision that makes air travel to these outer islands profit laden and consumer driven.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While I have the floor, Mr. Speaker, and to pre-empt the tiresome sexist and sneaky put downs 
<br/>by the honourable Minister for Economy on my understanding of his </span><span>dinau</span><span> that is placing all of our 
<br/>necks in the noose of debt slavery, I do know what </span><span>dinau </span><span>is.  I do know what debt is.  That is why I 
<br/>live a modest life that understands full well that my expenses must never drown my income.  In fact, 
<br/>everyone in Fiji understands this.  So this flaky idea that debt is good debt because this Government 
<br/>can borrow with the taxpayers guarantee but not necessarily their fullest consent backed by </span><span>lasulasu</span><span>
<br/>and  </span><span>jhooth</span><span>  justification,  would  surely  send  any  commercial  entity  or  small  to  medium  enterprise 
<br/>running for the hills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Sir,  I  take  exception  to  the  fact  that  if  I  question  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular statement by Honourable Qereqeretabua and, therefore, I am being sexist…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- She always says that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- …that is not being sexist.  So, in other words because she is 
<br/>a female, I cannot question what she is saying or I cannot question the veracity of what she is saying. 
<br/></span><span>That is not sexism.  I question her leader. Does that mean I am sexist?  I mean, that is a ridiculous 
<br/></span><span>proposition and he is taking advantage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of this particular discourse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, what I would like to mention is that Honourable Gavoka talked about 
<br/>Savusavu.  Fiji Airways, in fact, has looked at it for a number of years now.  To get a larger aircraft 
<br/>and I am sure Honourable Gavoka knows from his tourism days, that you have the sea on one side 
<br/>and you have the Savusavu Hill on the other, so when you have these types of tight landings on a 
<br/>runaway  that  is  short,  they  have  to  get  the  approval  of  those  manufacturers  of  those  particular 
<br/>aircrafts.  Sir, ATR has certified that there is no way you can have an ATR landing there.  The only 
<br/>way to do so is to build a runaway that goes out  into the sea. Those people who know Savusavu 
<br/>means we have to build out into the sea and that is going to be a very costly affair.  Studies have 
<br/>already been done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have  also  announced in  this  Parliament sometime back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are 
<br/>looking at an alternative site in Vanua Levu where we could build a new Green Field Project.  In fact, 
<br/>we  had  been  talking  to  ADB  and  there  was  some  funding  that  was  available  also  but  because  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div>
<div><span>476 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19, that has been put on hold because we realised that there is still a lot more potential for 
<br/>regional development in Vanua Levu, including the area of tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have, in fact, looked at three sites.  They most certainly are not in Labasa, 
<br/>they most certainly are not in Savusavu but they are somewhere where it could be easily accessible 
<br/>by both those two centres, which would make a lot more sense because if you are able build an airport 
<br/>that has eventually the ability to look at landing a Boeing 737 and God knows one day A330 or A350, 
<br/>then that is a good site.  Unfortunately, the airport in Labasa is built between the bend of a river, so 
<br/>you cannot extend that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the story, so we are looking at a longer term project.  In fact, in our 
<br/>discussions with ADB, we used the regional angle that it could also be used as a redundancy airport 
<br/>if something happens, for example, in  Viti Levu, and also  it is  closer to  countries  like Samoa, et 
<br/>cetera,  so  there  is  some  work  around  that.    I  do  not  want  to  give  the  exact  location,  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad may go running off and buy some land there.  We know you own large vast tracts 
<br/>of land and there is a lot of freehold land there too.  I know there is some co-operative land that you 
<br/>managed to get hold of too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua went on about the 2018 issue about why it was 
<br/></span><span>delayed.  She is using a one-off incident to cast some kind of aspersion on the entire filing of all the 
<br/>AFL reports.  So, please let us keep it under control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point we also want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNPF does not go through the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General, honourable Qereqeretabua.  They do their own audit, they outsource it.  The 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General does not have the actuarial skill-sets to be able to do that.  They do it 
<br/>on their own, that is why they are able to do it on time and that is precisely the point I was trying to 
<br/>make. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you are able to outsource it by accounting firms that are certified internationally, you 
<br/>will get much faster turnaround times.  I have pointed out organisations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that have 
<br/>submitted their accounts to OAG and they are still waiting for two or three years to finalise it.  It has 
<br/>not been done. Of course, it is quite trite to say, “oh good on you Auditor-General’s Office, you have 
<br/>done your own audit, you are right on time”, of course they are doing their own audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would also like to make, the fact is, Nadi Airport is the 
<br/>only airport that makes money for AFL.  I also would like to mention that a lot of people do not 
<br/></span><span>understand that one of the major sources of revenue for international airports is not from landing fees 
<br/></span><span>anymore, it is about the concessions that are available at the airport, in other words the rental. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was quite fascinating, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we put in place the law about the Nadi Re-
<br/>Development Programme (there is a law that we put in place) because we had a situation when Nadi 
<br/>Airport was, in fact, price controlled through rental.  So, FCCC actually had a price control on rental 
<br/>at Nadi Airport.  Companies like Prouds and Tappoos were paying rental of only about $3 million. 
<br/>Today, they are paying a combine of nearly $20 million, before COVID-19 I am talking about.  That 
<br/>is one of the major reasons why AFL was able to give a higher rate of return.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  SDL  days,  they  called  for  a  tender  for  space.    Tappoos  bid  was  higher  than 
<br/>Motibhai’s,  phone  calls were  made,  they  cancelled  the  tender  process.    There  was  a  compromise 
<br/>reached, Tappoos was given a bit more space and they just continued along paying $3 million to $4 
<br/>million when the real value of that real estate at the airport was not realised. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>477 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we put in place that law, we got rid of that price control mechanism, we got rid of all 
<br/>those shenanigans that were taking place about the lack of transparency and then both of them ended 
<br/>up paying about $8 million or $9 million each.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what happened. That is one 
<br/>of the major reasons why the revenue went up and we have seen the re-development.  People were 
<br/>actually renting space at Nadi Airport in that outside area, paying far cheaper rent than what people 
<br/>are paying in Namaka and Martintar.  Imagine Nadi Airport real estate, you go anywhere in the world, 
<br/>the rental will be highest at the airport, it is prime real estate.  That is what used to happen at AFL.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now we come back to the point about honourable Qereqeretabua saying that 
<br/>the others are non-profit making, it is a fact. Airports Fiji Limited is a limited liability company.  Just 
<br/>because it is 100 per cent owned by the Fijian Government, it does not mean it is going to engage in 
<br/>some sort of a charity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have, for example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Electricity Fiji Limited (EFL), we pay 50 per cent 
<br/>of the electricity bill of people who earn less than $30,000 a year.  We do not expect EFL to do it, if 
<br/>it is a Government policy, we pay EFL because EFL’s balance sheet needs to look good.  As a result 
<br/>of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total debt exposure of Government guarantee in EFL is down to less 
<br/>than a $100 million.  Before it used to sit at $300 million to $400 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every single development at Nausori Airport and Nadi Airport by AFL is not funded by the 
<br/>Fijian Government and the taxpayers at all.  It is funded by AFL - the company because its balance 
<br/>sheet  is  good.    Private  banks  want  to  lend  to  them,  actually  some  of  the  rates  they  got  was 
<br/>phenomenally cheap because of the asset base, the equity in the company.  They do not understand 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rotuma  Airport,  we  funded  because  it  needs  to  be  built,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Other  outer 
<br/>airports,  we  gave  the  grant  to  them.      In  the  same  way,  when  we  want  to  connect  a  village  or 
<br/>community to the grid through the Department of Energy, we pay EFL, we do not expect EFL to do 
<br/>it.  That is how the system works, that is how balance sheets becomes strong and they completely 
<br/>missed that point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not relegating the outer islands as second class, we are just stating a fact from a balance 
<br/>sheet perspective, and that is a fact.  We, of course, have to pay and we call for tenders for airline 
<br/>services to Rotuma and various other outer islands in Fiji because no one wants to fly because there 
<br/>is no refuelling.  If I am going to fly to some island in Lau, I do not take my full load.  I have to take 
<br/>half the load because I have to carry enough fuel to be able to fly back.  Northern Air and Fiji Link 
<br/></span><span>bid for it.  Some routes Northern Air has and some routes Fiji Link has, then Government as you saw 
<br/></span><span>in the Budget, we subsidised them, so the same thing applies to Government shipping companies.  
<br/>The franchise will not go otherwise, it does not make commercial sense for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, Vodafone and Digicel will not build towers in a place where there are only 
<br/>50 people living in a village because the tower will cost them probably a million dollars or half a 
<br/>million dollars.  If 50 people even use $10 a month, that is $500, $6,000 a year.  If you are putting a 
<br/>half a million dollar tower, when will they get their money back?

<div><span>That is where we come in through the Universal Service Fund.  We take a certain percentage 
<br/>of their profit, put it in a Trust Fund, we put money in there then we get the towers built.  They need 
<br/>to understand the fundamentals of how commercial enterprise works and how we need to be able to 
<br/>keep  the  separation  between  social  corporate  responsibility  and  Government  responsibility.    She 
<br/>talked about the fact that, “Oh, we know how to run a house, we should live within our means.”

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Airports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Government, if you look at almost all the governments in the world, all 
<br/>of them run deficits because there are certain services that we must provide.  We cannot say, “Oh, 
<br/>because of COVID-19, unlike Narube, we are going to cut all the civil servant’s salary.”  Imagine if 
<br/>we did that!  Why should we cut the salaries of the nurses and the doctors who are the frontliners, 
<br/>the police and other people?  That is what you call “living within your means”.  Let us cut social 
<br/>welfare – living within your means, let us not pay the market vendors fees, let us not pay $500 million 
<br/>in the Unemployment Benefits, that is what you call living within your means! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They do not have a fundamental understanding of the balancing act that we need to strike.  In 
<br/>a Government, unlike a business, it is not in the business of always making money.  There are certain 
<br/>services we have to provide for free.  There are poor people in Fiji.  For Fijians coming back from 
<br/>medical procedures, we paid for their quarantine - millions of dollars through the Ministry of Health.  
<br/>Otherwise, they would be stuck.  We paid for them, organised a place for them, and that is what you 
<br/>call  looking  after  your  citizens.    She  is  saying,  live  within  your  means.  Where  is  the  social 
<br/>responsibility? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the kind of contradiction in what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are saying, basic lack of understanding.   
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, she brought in Fiji Airways.  People do bid for outer islands and they say, 
<br/>“We are flabbergasted, they only went once a week.”  </span><span>Areh,</span><span> if there is not enough people wanting to 
<br/>fly, why do you want to fly to Rotuma everyday? Why? The airfares at Rotuma, before the airport 
<br/>was built, to fly a small aircraft the airfare was like flying to New Zealand - $600 to $700 to go to 
<br/>Rotuma. Now, we have a much bigger airport, we have an ATR72 landing, full load, the price comes 
<br/>down because you spread your expenditure. This is so fundamental. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it can be a bit embarrassing to be able to highlight all these things. I think 
<br/>AFL,  of  course,  is  doing  a  lot  of  upgrade.  The  Nausori  Airport,  we  hope  God-willing  when  the 
<br/>economy opens a lot more, then we can have more direct flights into Nausori because most of the 
<br/>Fijians who actually travel into Fiji and who to come to Nadi, a lot of them live within the Suva-
<br/>Nausori corridor.  We also think there is an opportunity in terms of Fiji being put as a hub of the 
<br/>Pacific, a lot of the UN agencies, et cetera, are based in Suva, so this will also give them a lot more 
<br/>opportunity to fly directly into Suva and makes it a lot more attractive as the capital city.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the AFL for its work and we look forward to ensuring 
<br/></span><span>that with the  opening of the borders, AFL can bounce back  in terms of the services it provide as the 
<br/></span><span>gateway to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have any further comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed.
