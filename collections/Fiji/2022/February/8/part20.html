<div><span>Update on the Strategic Management Team  
<br/>(Question No. 11/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Local 
<br/>Government update Parliament on this Strategic Management Team announced by the 
<br/>Minister in Parliament in April 2019 to review the master plans for Fiji’s main towns 
<br/>and which was to be led by prominent Singaporean Architect Liu Thai Ker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually this question should have been directed to 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, but I will take that question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, April 2019 is when this work started and in March 2020, that was when the 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19 cases came to Fiji and there were some disruption in the country, as well as globally. We 
<br/></span><span>had issues with the travels and, therefore, the team from Singapore could not come to Fiji.  For the 
<br/>last two  years they are not  in  Fiji,  however, some work has continued through  email, but  we are 
<br/>waiting for the borders to open.  As soon as the borders open, they will be able to come into the 
<br/>country and complete the work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work is still pending.  There are about four or five stages, but they have completed up to 
<br/>three stages.  Because the stages involves data collection and then with the data, they then do the 
<br/>scheme  planning,  consultation,  et  cetera.    They  have  to  follow  this  long  process  and  after 
<br/>consultation, they will be able to come up with a master plan.  This master plan will be able to solve 
<br/>a lot of problems for the people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment,  if someone wants  to  build something in  a particular zone, and if it is  not 
<br/>classified residential or commercial, then they have to put in  an application to the Department of 
<br/>Town  and  Country  Planning,  and  that  takes  a  lot  of  time,  because  the  zoning  process  itself  is 
<br/>cumbersome and it requires consultation with the people who live around that place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The master plan will provide the zones, so if someone wants to build a commercial building, 
<br/></span><span>we will just have to look at the master plan and say, “Right, this is commercial zoning,” so there is 
<br/></span><span>no reason why we have to reconsider or do anything extra, and then the approval can be given.  So 
<br/>there are benefits with the master plan, but at this stage, it is still not complete.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Just  one  follow  up  question,  please,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir; 
<br/>could the honourable Minister also tell us if she and her team factored in road use changes to the 
<br/>master plan development, especially now that we have been seeing so much flooding affecting vast 
<br/>areas of the country?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-    When  the  master  plan  is  drawn  up,  as  I  had  mentioned,  data  is 
<br/>collected in terms of rainfall, other parameters are taken like climate conditions, the suitability of the 
<br/>land is taken into consideration, how people are staying in that area - all those aspects are taken into 
<br/>consideration before decisions are made.

<div><span>Update on Visitor Arrivals – Reopening of Borders 
<br/>(Question No. 12/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on the visitor arrivals after the reopening of borders and outlook for 
<br/>the tourism industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this answer is actually two-fold, it is also an answer to 
<br/>the question that was raised by the honourable Professor Prasad and I did refer to him and said that 
<br/>there is a question.  Forgive me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this may be slightly lengthy but it is not too lengthy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two months ago, we opened our borders to travel partner countries and this is after nearly 
<br/>two years of being closed to the world.  Since then, there have been many positives and, of course, 
<br/>many, many challenges as we all know.  In 2021, our total visitor arrivals stood at 31,680, compared 
<br/>to our record high in 2019 of 894,389.  This was about 3.5 per cent of 2019 levels and pre-COVID-
<br/>19 levels, and a decline of about 96.5 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the month of December, we received 23,226 visitors and this was 73.5 
<br/>per cent of the total arrivals for the year.  The 23,000 odd visitors in December was 31per cent of the 
<br/>arrivals in December 2019.  This 31 per cent recovery can be attributed largely to Australia, which 
<br/>amounts to 17,896 and United States of America which is 3,502 - those two markets that collectively 
<br/>made up the 92 per cent of the total December arrivals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In December alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we collected net revenue of approximately $190 million 
<br/>and the highest monthly collection by Fiji Revenue and Customs Service since Fiji’s first COVID-
<br/>19 case in March 2020. These numbers although lower than pre-COVID-19, are an indication of our 
<br/>progress, a progress that is gradual and it is actually sustainable, so this is where we are now.  We 
<br/>want to say a big thank you also to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and the support from 
<br/>all the other Ministries that we had throughout this period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking ahead, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as honourable Gavoka will allude to  also,  February and 
<br/>March are traditionally low months in the tourism season.  So, whilst the April onwards bookings 
<br/>and forecast looks buoyant, it should be, hopefully, barring.  Any other difficulty should be doing 
<br/>alright.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  last  week,  as  we  all  know,  New  Zealand,  our  second  largest  source  tourism  market 
<br/>announced it will begin reopening to the world in phases and what this means for us is that, by next 
<br/>month we will start welcoming back our Kiwi friends and families after about two years.  So, based 
<br/>on  the  current  trend  as  more  markets  ease  travel  restrictions  and  open  up  the  borders,  the  Macro  
<br/>Economic Committee projects a total visitor arrivals in 2022 to reach about 50 per cent of the 2019 
<br/>level,  that  is  about  447,000  visitors  as  an  optimistic  outlook,  if  the  conditions  remain  favourable 
<br/>globally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will not be an easy path to recovery.  The Ministry, Tourism 
<br/>Fiji and COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce have worked tirelessly to reach where we are today, 
<br/>and as the other markets actually open up, this means (we have mentioned this yesterday and I think 
<br/>today too) increased competition for Fiji from destinations that are larger with a lot more resources.  
<br/>So destinations will employ any and all tactics because we all know, to attract source markets and 
<br/>they  will  provide  rock  bottom  prices  with  some  possibly  compromising  standards  and  safety  of 
<br/>visitors.

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>481 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, Mr. Speaker, as a country have to keep our eyes firmly focussed on two things.  One is 
<br/>our competitiveness and this means that most of the food and beverage, accommodation, COVID-19 
<br/>test all need to be cost effective in line with Government’s generous tax policies and initiatives.  The 
<br/>industry needs also to reflect the reduction and removal of taxes in their prices.  Secondly, also our 
<br/>image as a safe destination. This is very important, Sir, and I am sure the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Health will support me on this.  Here, all Fijians need to play their part in portraying this particular 
<br/>image.  We need to not only just follow the COVID safe behaviour but be seen to be doing so.  It is 
<br/>extremely important.  We must respect the Care Fiji Commitment (CFC) and all the protocols that 
<br/>have actually been laid down by the Government. It only takes a small mishap, Sir, and then we are 
<br/>back to square one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have heard, Mr. Speaker, the worst of Omicron wave is actually behind us.  This means 
<br/>we are gearing up for the next phase but as announced on Sunday also, travellers aged 12 years and 
<br/>over from one of Fiji’s travel partner countries now have not had an option of taking a negative Rapid 
<br/>Antigen Test (RAT) within 24 hours of the flight’s scheduled departure and this actually eliminates 
<br/>the burden of paying for a PCR test which could cost the family thousands even before they reach 
<br/>Fiji.  This, Mr. Speaker, is actually a game  changer and will add to our competitiveness with the 
<br/>increase in reliability and reliance of RATs and Fiji has followed other countries, like Australia, in 
<br/></span><span>making this move. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, we have 57 travel partner countries with the most recent additions being 
<br/>the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR, and what this means is that, we can also focus on 
<br/>what was once our emerging markets - Asia,  like Hong Kong, Japan, China and Singapore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we can only go as fast as they open up to us  but I want to be clear though, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that the easing of restrictions is actually not done in isolation. It is part of a systematic and 
<br/>comprehensive policy of reopening based on science and economic realities. So, becoming a nation 
<br/>with one of the highest COVID-19 vaccine coverages has actually helped us immensely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say thank you to every single Fijian citizen, whose actually taken 
<br/>up the vaccination.  It has put us in a good space and you can see how comfortable we are sitting in 
<br/>this particular Parliament and attending to what we need to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  tourism  industry  will  also  continue  to  be  guided  by  the  CFC 
<br/>because we have come too far to let our guards down. Today, we have over 2,200 businesses CFC 
<br/>certified, compared to 1,741 in December 2021 and as any destination can expect, we have seen some 
<br/></span><span>non-compliance but they have been dealt with severely.  These businesses have and will be dealt with 
<br/></span><span>if they continue to disregard, and I mean this.  They can cost us our national efforts, so, we must 
<br/>always be on the guard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  reiterate  the  Acting  Prime  Minister’s  caution  to  the  tourism 
<br/>operators, lack of adherence to CFC standards will absolutely not be tolerated. If you fail to comply, 
<br/>our COVID- safe ambassadors and the Police will shut your operation down, it is as simple as that.  
<br/>We will not allow non-compliant operators to spoil it for those who actually follow the rules. We 
<br/>have had to work very hard.  Every single frontline worker has worked very hard, the COVID-19 
<br/>Risk Mitigation Taskforce has worked very hard, all the Ministries have been working tirelessly to 
<br/>get us into this position, so we will not let anyone destroy that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To share the world, we are open, we continue to ensure our targeted campaigns and tell the 
<br/>world,  “We  actually  are  a  safe  destination”.    Last  year  we  launched  Fiji’s  Open  for  Happiness 
<br/>Campaign  in  anticipation  of  our  border  reopening.    The  Campaign  actually  took  Fiji  to  over  13 
<br/>million people across the social channels with over 14.5 million views.

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are far too many people who have actually worked, Mr. Speaker, Sir, prayed very hard 
<br/>to get us onto this path of recovery and it takes strong partnership and that is what we have done, Sir.  
<br/>The  Government,  the  industry  and  all  the  stakeholders,  our  bilateral,  our  development  partners, 
<br/>everyone has been very, very instrumental in all of these and this is the time also for me to say “thank 
<br/>you” to all of them who have been an integral part of getting us back on this particular path.  So I 
<br/>hope that with us and the other side of the House will also ensure that we support the tourism industry 
<br/>and the stakeholders so we can actually support the economy in moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.  VEGNATHAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  ask  a 
<br/>supplementary question.  Can the honourable Minister update this august House on how visitors are 
<br/>kept safe at our resorts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually a very important question.  We have done 
<br/>phenomenally  well  in  demonstrating  our  ability  to  keep  our  visitors  safe  and  without  actually 
<br/>compromising our renowned hospitality.  This is precisely what the Care Fiji Commitment (CFC) is 
<br/>all about.  The CFC is a WHO approved standard of best practice health and safety measures for 
<br/>travel  in  a  post-COVID  world  and  led  by  Tourism  Fiji  with  the  support  of  the  Ministry,  the 
<br/>programme provides added confidence to international guests that Fiji is a safe destination to come 
<br/></span><span>to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To provide these services to international visitors, tourism operators must be CFC certified.  
<br/>The industry has aligned its daily operations and product offerings also with COVID-safe measures 
<br/>designed to reduce risks at each step of the tourism value chain.  In fact, I can proudly say, Sir, that 
<br/>almost the entire business community has actually adopted this particular CFC principles to build 
<br/>back better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every tourism business needs to have a dedicated wellness ambassador as part of the CFC 
<br/>and these ambassadors undertake extensive trainings on the COVID-safe best practices.  So, when a 
<br/>tourism operator adopts a CFC, they commit to ensuring that the business and every staff is fully 
<br/>vaccinated, masks are worn, physical distancing is kept and there is regular sanitisation and an in-
<br/>country  COVID-19  testing  is  available,  guests  and  staff  are  tested  routinely  and  there  is  well-
<br/>managed tested isolation protocols when required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to these minimum measures, Sir, all international visitors are only recommended 
<br/>to engage in tourism experiences that are CFC certified and they fall within the actual safe travel 
<br/>areas.    To  ensure  that  we  have  got  industry  compliance  to  COVID-19  safe  measures,  regular 
<br/></span><span>monitoring also and surveillance is being done by us on an ongoing basis.  Stringent penalties are 
<br/></span><span>also there, Sir, for those who do not comply with the measures that are being put in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  COVID-19  safe  ambassadors  that  we  introduced  last  year  will  continue  as  an  added 
<br/>mechanism to advocate adherence to COVID-safe measures, Sir.  I hope that answers your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Shipping Franchise Scheme – Current Status 
<br/> (Question No. 13/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the current status of the Government Shipping Franchise Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is  a question that is of continual  interest  to  the 
<br/>Opposition and rightfully so because this initiative is so important and it actually directly impacts the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="103">Page 103</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lives of our maritime islanders.  Every year, the interest is shown by the Opposition on the Scheme 
<br/>and every year we do not hesitate to provide an update, not for any other reason except for the fact 
<br/>that we do not leave anyone behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government Shipping Franchise is Government funded, as we all know, 
<br/>and it ensures the movement of cargo and passengers between our maritime islands.  The Scheme 
<br/>enables  connectivity  and  accessibility  to  markets,  increasing  economic  activities  and  improving 
<br/>livelihoods.  It is actually essential to maritime connectivity and accessibility, especially with respect 
<br/>to our uneconomical routes.  So, there are 10 routes operated under the Franchise Scheme and these 
<br/>include;  Rotuma,  Beqa,  Yanuca,  Vatulele,  Yasawa  and  the  lower  Southern  Lau,  which  actually 
<br/>operates on a monthly basis, Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Upper Southern Lau, Northern Lau and Yasayasa 
<br/>Moala, which operate on a bi-monthly basis and North-East Vanua Levu which operates every two 
<br/>months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have over $2 million which is allocated for the Franchise Scheme.  In 
<br/>the current financial year, the same budget allocation have always been provided every year since 
<br/>the existence of the Scheme.  This is because the Fijian Government is strongly committed to the 
<br/>continuous provision of efficient and affordable shipping services to our islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2020 and 2021 have not been normal years in terms of shipping services 
<br/>both,  globally  and  domestically.    We  will  strive  to  ensure  that  the  ships  are  still  commuting  our 
<br/>islands and provide the necessary support.  Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, we will only on the 
<br/>transport of cargo, the Government continues to pay the subsidies for the service of the uneconomical 
<br/>routes. So, this continues with 14 trips to 15</span><span> </span><span>trips per month and this is how committed we are with 
<br/>respect to our maritime islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Franchise Scheme has continued to provide more 
<br/>than  250-odd  trips  that  accommodated  about  19,000  passengers  and  more  than  11,000  tonnes  of 
<br/>cargo. Apart from the direct subsidies that are paid by Government to private vessel operators, the 
<br/>Government  Shipping  Services  (GSS)  also  provides  services  to  uneconomical  routes,  such  as 
<br/>Yasawa, North-East Vanua Levu, Beqa, Yanuca, Vatulele and Lower Southern Lau where the private 
<br/>sector is actually unable to service due to high maintenance of vessels and operating cost issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has allocated more than $6 million budget to GSS with more than $2 million 
<br/>allocated  for  maintenance  and  operations,  and  FijiFirst  Government  will  maintain  this  particular 
<br/>commitment and ensure that our islands are supported wholeheartedly.  Apart from providing such 
<br/></span><span>services, GSS is also working closely with Maritime Safety of Authority Fiji (MSAF) and also the 
<br/></span><span>Hydrographic Office in upgrading our ATONs, the Aids to Navigation for safe navigation of these 
<br/>vessels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Franchise Scheme has also ensured that people in the Maritime regions have access to 
<br/>food, stores, medical and other essential supplies.  Most recently, we experienced </span><span>TC Cody</span><span> and we 
<br/>continue experiencing adverse weather which affects our services to maritime islands but this also 
<br/>leads to mishaps and accidents at sea, Sir.  At certain points of the voyage, severe bad weather or 
<br/>high waves affect transportation but when vessel operators do not take necessary precaution, these 
<br/>matters are very seriously taken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Safety at sea was always very paramount to us under the GSS and the Franchise Scheme and 
<br/>I want to thank also the selfless and hardworking team at the GSS who are on-call 24 hours seven 
<br/>days a week, Sir, and they are always ready to assist whether it is a franchise trip or a humanitarian 
<br/>assistance trip in the event of a natural disaster.  I thank you for allowing me to respond.

<div><span>Update on Damage to Aquaculture Farms  
<br/>(Question No. 14/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  update  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>response in assessing the damages sustained for aquaculture farms across Fiji due to the recent 
<br/>adverse weather conditions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  and  I  thank  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has  standard  plans  to  address  the  uncertainties 
<br/>brought about by adverse weather conditions.  The Ministry of Fisheries response to adverse weather 
<br/>conditions and associated cyclone is undertaken through our regional offices. Within these offices, 
<br/>our Officials conduct initial damage assessment for farms and farmers within affected areas.    Sir, 
<br/>Divisional Offices of the Ministry would mobilise within 24 hours to affected communities in which 
<br/>initial assessments are conducted and documented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, through the Divisional Emergency Operation Centres across Fiji, the Ministry 
<br/>of  Fisheries  also  render  support  to  the  Divisional  Commissioners  through  logistics  and  manning 
<br/>during the initial damage assessment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the quantification figures identified through the initial damage assessment 
<br/>is  important  because  it  helps  us  identify  key  areas  of  assistance  to  communities  and  helps  in  the 
<br/>speedy rebuilding process.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Special Purpose Audit on Lots Allotment - Housing Authority 
<br/>(Question No. 15/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the Special 
<br/>Purpose Audit (special investigation) on lots allotment and awarding of tenders by Housing 
<br/>Authority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, the honourable Minister Education, Heritage and Arts and Local 
<br/>Government was the Minister then when she, through her Ministry, asked for the engagement of the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) to perform a special audit report because they had received 
<br/>numerous complaints about lot allotment.  There were lot of allegations regarding the fact that a lot 
<br/>of people who were buying lots who, in fact, were not entitled to it because the idea was that, those 
<br/>low income people should be entitled to the first bite of the cherry so to speak, to get those lots. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a number of weaknesses that were found in the operational side 
<br/>of the Housing Authority, in the management, and also the middle management level where people 
<br/>had acquired lots, who should not have acquired those lots.  As a result of which a number of matters 
<br/>were highlighted, in fact, frankly, the audit that was done was not a very good audit.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>485 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We believe that a lot more could have been done by the OAG.  They did not meet the Terms 
<br/>of Reference (TOR) and we had asked them to verify all information by checking the Titles Office, 
<br/>FNPF, et cetera, which was not done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, we were informed that perhaps, some people from the OAG may have acquired some 
<br/>of those lots too and not necessarily entitled to it.  So, there is a lot of things in the closet that is yet 
<br/>to be leaked out but as a result of being proactive about it, the current  Board is in the process of 
<br/>finalising a draft Lot Allocation Policy which is going to be reviewed by the Ministry and the Board, 
<br/>a Mechanism Periodic Declaration by Board Members also, and all other stuff in particular.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  files  related  to  the  allocation  of  lots  to  several  former  employees  have  also  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>submitted to FICAC itself for them to investigate as to how the staff had acquired those lots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a new Board and is chaired by the CEO of FNPF, Viliame Vodonaivalu;  Deputy 
<br/>Chairperson is the CEO of FDB, Saud Minam; we have an engineer - Renee Duguivalu from Nadi; 
<br/>Susan Naidu, who is also the manager of Koroipita Homes in Lautoka; Florence Takinana who is a 
<br/>lawyer by profession; and a member of the real estates fraternity. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Goard is 
<br/>currently finalising all these action plans and we hope to improve these processes within the Housing 
<br/></span><span>Authority itself, Sir. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- A supplementary question, Sir; can the honourable Acting Prime Minister, 
<br/>in his capacity as Minister responsible for  Housing, inform Parliament on what is happening with 
<br/>regards to Lagilagi Housing Project?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  It is not directly related 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but in a way it is indirectly related, a similar issue but a bigger debacle over here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Lagilagi Housing Project is commonly known also as Jittu Estate.  The Government 
<br/>at that time, obviously, wanted to  give proper housing to those people who live in Jittu Estate or 
<br/>Lagilagi Housing.  We funded, actually through People’s Community Network (PCN) which was 
<br/>headed by Father Kevin Barr and his group of people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, we already had disbursed a lot of money.  Sir, 33 units were built under one phase 
<br/>which costs about $2.9 million, then another  worth $2.15 million was done.   A German Catholic 
<br/>Agency had put in about $649,000 and the Asian Coalition Housing Rights - $142,000.  We then 
<br/>further approved funding of about $12 million, Sir, for the construction of additional 120 units.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  only  84  units  were  completed  and  the  remaining  36  units  are  partially 
<br/>completed.    Unfortunately,  Sir,  PCN  which  is  quite  actually  shambolic,  collected  money  from 
<br/>literally hundreds of Fijians.  People have given monies of about $5,000; $10,000 and $20,000 and 
<br/>the Minister then had also asked FCCC to carry out an audit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  they  did  an  investigation  and  found  out,  Sir,  that  in  the  first  or  initial  stage  336 
<br/>complainants  deposited  a  total  sum  of  $2.2  million  to  PCN.    The  money  is  gone,  the  money  has 
<br/>actually disappeared, so  at  the moment,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, as  Government, have decided as  a 
<br/>policy that we need to refund this $2.2 million.  We have to find this money and we hope to do so 
<br/>very soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is really quite sad because a lot of people had saved money and mostly the low income 
<br/>people.  I mean, I was just at one of the restaurants in Damodar City a couple of months ago, a number 
<br/>of waiters and waitresses came up to me and said, “Look, I put $5,000, I put $10,000, what will I do? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How will I get my money back?  So, we have been working internally to see what we can do, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the meantime, of course, we have to wrestle away this land from PCN.  There has been 
<br/>some talk about certain offshore bank account. Unfortunately, Father Kevin Barr has passed on.  The 
<br/>person who is running PCN is an adopted son and seems to have disappeared.  We do not have a 
<br/>functioning trust that was set up. The land was State land and as a result of the breach of the condition 
<br/>of  the  lease,  through  the  Ministry  of  Lands,  we  are  in  the  process  of  getting  that  land  back  to 
<br/>Government, so that Government can then take over the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at where Jittu Estate is, Sir, it is actually prime land. It is at the back of Belo Street, 
<br/>coming on to Grantham Road and we want that area to be developed.  We need to take a different 
<br/>model approach to it too.  There needs to be some high-rise development.  We should be able to be 
<br/>subsidise some of that by perhaps, doing some subdivision and allocating where we can get some 
<br/>proper funding for the sale of the lots.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are business people, Sir, who are actually living in those apartments.  There are some 
<br/>foreigners who have actually acquired those apartments too.  It is quite sad, so we are in the process 
<br/></span><span>of resolving that issue, it is a big matter.  We are trying to, sort of, weave our way through it, we need 
<br/></span><span>to get the legal aspect to be right.  The main issue is to get the land back into the Government’s land 
<br/>system, and then we can move on from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance to Co-operatives during COVID-19 Pandemic 
<br/>(Question No. 16/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport 
<br/>inform  Parliament  if  assistance  has  been  provided  to  Co-operatives  during  the 
<br/>pandemic? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that honourable Jale is not here, but I 
<br/>have got some good information, which may mean that they will not come back and ask again.  I 
<br/>thank the honourable Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said earlier on, today there are close to 400 odd operating co-operatives in all the 
<br/></span><span>Divisions  that  are  involved  in  14  odd  different  sectors,  namely,  wholesale/retail,  administrative 
<br/></span><span>support service, banking, agriculture, food industry, real  estate,  and transport sectors. Despite the 
<br/>setback of COVID-19 and some of the wishes on the other side of the House, co-operatives actually 
<br/>continued to flourish and they hold over about $133 million worth of assets.  They have maintained 
<br/>revenue of $17.9 million.  Contrary to what honourable Kuridrani may believe, they still exist and 
<br/>they do very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, co-operatives generated a net profit of $2.5 million.  
<br/>This  is  such an important  statistics.  We have more than 24,500  Fijians who are members of  co-
<br/>operatives and we have more Fijians joining the cooperative family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Co-operative receives new registrations on a weekly basis.  As a member-
<br/>driven business, this resilience by our co-operatives is actually admirable.  They are robust and are 
<br/>resilient businesses and this is because of the foundation upon which these cooperatives are built, 
<br/>such  as  self-help,  self-responsibility,  democracy,  equity  and  solidarity  are  actually  critical  to  its 
<br/>Like  other  businesses,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  cooperatives  also  suffered  during  the 
<br/>success.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pandemic, however, with the self-help and solidarity that we are talking about, they showed some 
<br/>resilience and members are able to pull their resources, finance and skills together to quickly adapt 
<br/>to the situation and they adjusted their plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  also  provided  assistance  to  boost  the  recovery  of  the  Micro,  Small  and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), including co-operatives.  Holistically speaking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>support  provided  to  the  MSMEs  and  co-operatives  actually  ranged  from  financial  assistance  to 
<br/>training  and  handholding  exercise  and  guiding  and  nurturing  the  co-operatives  in  their  business 
<br/>ventures and possible areas of growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to put on record, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that co-operatives have received assistance prior to 
<br/>the pandemic and will also receive assistance post pandemic.  So we are here for them and we are 
<br/>here to stay, contrary to what is believed on the other side of the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Co-operatives  have  received  closed  to  $300,000  through  the  numerous  livelihood 
<br/>programmes that we (Ministry) have offered since the outbreak of the pandemic in Fiji.  For instance, 
<br/>in the MSME concessional loan programme, $72,500 was provided to co-operatives.   The Sede Na 
<br/>Qele Co-operative Limited in the North which is a women-based fishing co-operative used the funds 
<br/></span><span>to plant about 500 </span><span>yaqona</span><span> plants to grow and diversify its business from fisheries to farming.  So this 
<br/></span><span>is just one of the positive stories that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  our  IHRDP  Programme,  $197,602  was  provided  to  five  different  co-operatives  for 
<br/>capital projects and through this funding programme, the business has provided one-third, whilst the 
<br/>Fijian Government provided its two-thirds contribution towards the project.  The concept is actually 
<br/>giving co-operatives ownership and responsibility for the resources that are invested in the venture.  
<br/>One other such successful recipient is the Lovu Co-operative Limited in Gau, Lomaviti. They were 
<br/>recently assisted with a 23 foot fibreglass boat with an engine, deep freezer and solar panels and this 
<br/>came  to  close  to  $24,000.  This  is  a  youth-based  co-operative  and  it  managed  to  boost  its  shop 
<br/>operations and actually diversified into the fishing business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also worked closely with resource-based Ministries, like the Ministry of Agriculture, 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of iTaukei, plus development partners, to 
<br/>support the establishment of cooperatives and assist them in progressing their ventures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture’s  Farm  Mechanisation  Programme,  the  registered  co-
<br/>operatives were also able to access support in the form of tractors and rice harvesters which not only 
<br/></span><span>improves  their  crop  production  but  resolves  some  of  their  supply  chain  issues.    The  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Fisheries has also given a lot of support with respect to freezers and solar panels to co-operatives, 
<br/>particularly in the remote islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the Ministry is working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN to 
<br/>develop some training materials for the co-operatives. Contrary to what honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/>believes, Sir, more sugarcane based co-operatives now own their own sugarcane harvesters.  This is 
<br/>made possible through the funding programmes that was developed by the Ministry of Sugar and the 
<br/>Fiji Development Bank.  Honourable Professor Prasad yesterday claimed that we will actually kill 
<br/>the sugar industry when, in fact, we are finding innovative ways to keep the industry going.  It is a 
<br/>tough job but we will keep it going, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond  financial  assistance  and  collaborations  for  the  benefit  of  co-operatives,  we  have 
<br/>continued to offer them mentoring and guidance in terms of services to ensure that they are able to 
<br/>serve the business community.

<div><span>During the time of movement restrictions and internal borders, we also reviewed our training 
<br/>in co-operative.  We have got them using online and the zoom platform has been wonderful for us to 
<br/>ensure that they get to continue with their training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  the  pandemic,  Mr.  Speaker,  a  total  of  46  trainings  have  been  conducted  and  that 
<br/>benefitted the co-operatives in terms of 1,561 Fijians, this was right throughout the pandemic.  So, 
<br/>not only did we train them, we also educated the co-operatives on COVID safe business protocols, 
<br/>whilst they conducted their businesses. We have an enormous potential for co-operatives also, again, 
<br/>to continue to improve.  Co-operative is actually here to stay.  It is not an outdated business model 
<br/>but it is here to stay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you know anyone that is in a cluster or has a cluster or group of people, be it with your own 
<br/>youth groups or </span><span>mataqali</span><span> groups who have an asset and would like to generate some returns from it, 
<br/>establishing a co-operative is strongly recommended.  Please, get in touch with us and all that you 
<br/>know.

<div><span>Job Test for School Heads 
<br/>(Question No. 17/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government  inform  Parliament  on  the  current  status  of  the  Job  Test  for  Heads  of 
<br/>Schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also thank, honourable thank, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Radrodro for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I explain the recruitment process for the Heads of School, just a way 
<br/>of background, the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) for the Ministry of Education’s teaching positions 
<br/>were carried out as part of the Whole of Government evaluation exercise where teaching positions 
<br/>were evaluated and respective salary bands were assigned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The JEE was designed to ensure that teachers were paid in accordance with the work that they 
<br/>do in school.  All positions during this period were evaluated and a Band was assigned to a post.  
<br/>Head of School’s transition to respective Bands J, K and L is based on the size of the schools.  These 
<br/></span><span>positions require Postgraduate qualification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  the  JEE,  the  revised  MQR  were  created,  the  qualification  requirement  for  the 
<br/>small, medium and large schools were same, except the experience which was clearly defined.  For 
<br/>example, prior to JEE, five years of experience was required for leadership role, immaterial whether 
<br/>the school was small, large or medium.  Now, the experience changed, for small schools, five years 
<br/>teaching  experience  and  three  years’  experience  in  educational  leadership.  For  medium  schools, 
<br/>seven  years  teaching  experience  and,  at  least,  five  years  educational  leadership  experience  is 
<br/>required.    For  large  schools,  10  years  teaching  experience  and,  at  least,  five  years  educational 
<br/>leadership experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on MQR, applicants were shortlisted.  The Ministry received a total 
<br/>of  1,424  applications,  only  408  applicants  met  the  MQR  and  those  408  applicants  were  then 
<br/>shortlisted to sit for the job test.  The job test was conducted at the Fiji National University Computer 
<br/>Laboratories in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions on 30</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2021.

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>489 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A supplementary question; can the honourable Minister and I 
<br/>am a bit confused.  You announced the MQR changes on 20</span><span>th</span><span> January, now you are saying that the 
<br/>JEE was done.  I understand one JEE was done in 2017? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  After  that,  people  were  appointed  on  the  basis  of  that  job 
<br/>evaluation.    When  was  this  new  job  evaluation  done?    It  is  after  2017  so  was  there  another  job 
<br/>evaluation done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- One cannot have job evaluation after a job evaluation.  Job evaluation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was done in 2017… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was what you said now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, I did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- A supplementary question to the honourable Minister.  I thank 
<br/></span><span>her for the explanation that was given.  In fact, I expected more on the explanation that should be 
<br/></span><span>given, whether job test also applies to heads of schools in primary schools or only applicable to heads 
<br/>of school in high school?  That is more like some more information that we would like to hear from 
<br/>the honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are instances where existing Principals who have been holding the position for more 
<br/>than 10 years and who have excellent school record in terms of exam results, with some even having 
<br/>Postgraduate and Masters qualification are being left out of this  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  is,  what  will  happen  to  the  employment  status  of  those 
<br/>Principals who are currently in Principal  position in their respective schools but are being left out of 
<br/>the job test come April 2022? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should understand better.  In any private sector, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when you conduct an interview, there is an MQR, and that is the first step one has to meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, the MQR has not been changed.  The MQR clearly stated that one 
<br/></span><span>has to have a Postgraduate qualification and they must have an Undergraduate degree and certain 
<br/>years of experience. So, that is the MQR and when they meet that, then we go to the next step.  So, 
<br/>we prepare a long list and a short list and after that, we conduct the job test.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  honourable  Radrodro  is  saying  is  that,  there  are  heads  of  schools  who  have  got 
<br/>Postgraduate qualification and they have got undergraduate qualification in teaching qualifications 
<br/>or teaching degree, then he should bring it to our attention but as far as we know, people who applied, 
<br/>this is the process we have followed and that is where we are.  For everyone’s information, out of 
<br/>408 applicants who did the job test, only 124 candidates actually met the benchmark.   So we will be 
<br/>conducting interview for only 124 candidates, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Increase in Inflation 
<br/>(Question No. 18/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="110">Page 110</a></div>
<div><span>490 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  why 
<br/>inflation has increased recently? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very topical issue, this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to contextualise it, inflation stayed in the negative range for around 16 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>months in the past.  That is between October 2019 and January 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since August 2021, however, Mr. Speaker, Sir, inflation has been on an upward trajectory, 
<br/>led by supply side constraints and recovery of domestic demand, relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions 
<br/>and higher freight costs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  earlier  in  the  pandemic,  disruption  to  the  global  supply  chain  due  to 
<br/>lockdowns, as well as labour and container shortages started to substantially raise the cost of freight 
<br/>and  international  trade.    And  as  demand  started  to  recover,  especially  in  advanced  or  developed 
<br/>countries, the resulting mismatch between demand and supply fuelled inflationary pressures across 
<br/>the globe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, higher global and trading partner, inflation eventually trickles down to all 
<br/>of us.  By way of example, in December last year, inflation in the United States was seven per cent, 
<br/>the highest in almost four decades, while in New Zealand inflation reached a 30-year high of 5.9 
<br/>percent.  Similarly in Australia, inflation was 3.5 percent at the end of 2021, the highest since 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given those three countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our key trading partners, high inflation in those 
<br/>countries obviously will be eventually passed on to our domestic prices through the goods we import 
<br/>from those countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji, of course, has not been spared from the rise in global inflation.  Annual 
<br/>headline inflation has been increasing since the second half of 2021.  It was 3 percent in December 
<br/>last  year.    Higher  prices  were  noted  mainly  for  food  and  fuel,  resulting  from  the  surge  in  global 
<br/>commodity prices and continuous supply chain disruptions amid a rapid rise in pent-up demand in 
<br/>developed countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In January, the inflation rate was 2.7 percent, Sir, led by higher prices for food and fuel, as 
<br/>well as household furnishings and maintenance and health products.  Estimates by the RBF revealed 
<br/></span><span>that in 2021, imported inflation was the major factor and averaging at 4.4 percent, while domestic 
<br/></span><span>inflation was relatively muted at minus 1.1 percent.   The higher imported inflation was mainly for 
<br/>food and fuel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next few months, however, given the recent flooding we have had, 
<br/>we will also expect some domestic inflation to rise, of course, in particular to fruits, vegetables, et 
<br/>cetera, and because of the damage in places like Sigatoka, Ba and various other places around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  we  have  seen  is  that,  due  to  the  high  pent-up  prices 
<br/>offshore, supply chain issues, freight cost issues and because Fiji is so heavily dependent on imports, 
<br/>in terms of our day to day living and nearly everything we use is imported, you will see that passed 
<br/>on.  Fuel prices went up and honourable Professor Prasad made a big noise about that some months 
<br/>back.  Of course, he has not said anything because fuel price has already come down by 10 percent 
<br/>since it went up.  But we are projecting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the global trends, it would 
<br/>probably pick up again very soon. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the IMF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, crude oil prices are forecasted to rise further by 11.9 
<br/>percent this year.  Nonetheless, the sharp rise in oil prices and the supply chain disruptions are largely 
<br/>transitory and should start to ease from later this year.  So, it will go up, but expect it to come down 
<br/>further on as economies will open up and there is some form of rationalisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government reduced duty on about 2,000 items last  year in the Budget.  
<br/>We, of course, made sure that we bring down a lot of the imported items that are used in the tourism 
<br/>sector, for example, and are used by the ordinary Fijians too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would have been an actually a disaster if our dollar was devalued.  If you look at the history 
<br/>of inflation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it  is generally after devaluation  of the Fijian dollar, there are large 
<br/>economic shocks either financial or geopolitical, for example, in 1987, 1998 and 2009. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The COVID-19 pandemic led to the largest economic contraction in our modern history. We 
<br/>have always said that.  After borders were closed down for almost two years, we lost $4 billion in 
<br/>tourism earnings.  However, despite this 100-year event, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we have buoyant 
<br/>foreign reserves well over the IMF’s benchmark of three months of import cover, there was no need 
<br/>to actually devalue the Fijian dollar.  Of course, it would have been catastrophic if we would have 
<br/></span><span>had to do that.  It could have put a lot of pressure, in particular on low income families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at the inflation rates, kind of, stabilising towards the latter 
<br/>part of this year, as I have stated earlier on.  Of course, if we had not reduced many of the items, then 
<br/>we would have been in a different position, but that is one the reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just recently got some figures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, today. Wheat prices are looking like it is 
<br/>going to go up.  As I have said publicly, we make flour from wheat.  Two companies in Fiji import 
<br/>wheat - FMF and Punjas &amp; Sons, but flour is actually price controlled.  However, if the input cost is 
<br/>higher and it gets higher, we expect the prices to go higher.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we price control.  If Punjas &amp; Sons brings in the wheat, they grind it, they put other stuff 
<br/>in it and we get flour.  We then price control it at wholesale.  And then it gets sold to the retailers, it 
<br/>is again price control there too.  But as I have said, if the wheat price at the moment is $298.22 and 
<br/>now it is going to go up in excess of $350, that obviously will be passed on to us.  So the price of 
<br/>bread, </span><span>babakau, purini</span><span>, cake, </span><span>roti</span><span>, everything can actually go up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the kind of things that we will need to anticipate and we are, of course, working 
<br/></span><span>behind the scenes to see how we can actually mitigate those costs, these inflated prices, Sir. Thank 
<br/></span><span>you.
