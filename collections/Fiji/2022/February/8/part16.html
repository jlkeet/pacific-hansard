<h3>REVIEW REPORT- FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY 2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span> </span><span>REVIEW REPORT- FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY 2019 ANNUAL REPORT</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Fiji National University 2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 20th September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National University (FNU) was established by 
<br/>the Fiji National University Act 2009 (as amended by the Fiji National University (Amendment) Act 
<br/>2010).  The principal activities of the University are the provision of post-secondary programmes of 
<br/>study  in  higher  education,  technical,  vocational  education  and  training  that  are  responsive  to  the 
<br/>needs of the industry, the marketplace and the non-formal sector of employment to students from Fiji 
<br/>and other countries in the South Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  would like to  expand on some noteworthy  findings of the Committee, 
<br/></span><span>emanating from its scrutiny of FNU’s operations for 2019.  The Committee noted that vocational 
<br/>training programmes continued to be offered by the University through the National Training and 
<br/>Productivity  Centre’s  Community-Based  and  Non-Formal  Education.    The  vocational  courses 
<br/>offered are inclusive for the people of all ages, including people living with disabilities.  Through the 
<br/>continuous  existence of  the training centre, the  University is touted to  be the leading provider of 
<br/>TVET in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The University’s current Strategic Plan sets out goals and aspirations to be achieved by 2026.  
<br/>Three  of  the  four  pillars  of  the  Strategic  Plan  map  explicitly  focus  on  achieving  the  National 
<br/>Development Plan goals, particularly in the areas of education for employability, research with real 
<br/>world impact and student experience. The fourth pillar is about financial sustainability which is vital 
<br/>in the wake of COVID-19, and its impact on the economy.  It reflects the necessity for the University 
<br/>to diversify into income streams and provide excellent value for money in the investment of public 
<br/>funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the Committee’s role is to ensure that relevant agencies mainstream 
<br/>the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  in  their  work.    In  this  regard,  we  observe  that  FNU 
<br/></span><span>continues to align its strategies towards achieving SDG 4 - Quality Education; SDG 8 - Decent Work 
<br/></span><span>and Economic Growth; SDG 9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities 
<br/>and  Communities;  and  SDG  13  -  Climate  Action.    We  also  found  that  25  students  living  with 
<br/>disabilities were registered at the FNU Disability Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An orientation was conducted by the Office of the Registrar to enlighten them on the services 
<br/>and support provided by the University which includes, data gifting to help them with online studies, 
<br/>CV  writing  and  mock  interview  training,  mentoring  and  support  to  students  to  assist  them  in 
<br/>succeeding in their studies, and participating in capacity building workshops organised by the Fiji 
<br/>Disabled Peoples Federation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The major project achievements of the University for the 2019 financial year have been the 
<br/>commissioning of physical servers and replication to the disaster recovery site, the finance system 
<br/>going live for tests, while training and data conversion and configuration works for the student and 
<br/>human resource system. The student system was expected to come live in the last quarter of 2020.

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  most  significant  achievement  for  the  National  Training  and  Productivity 
<br/>Centre in 2019 was the creation of the Fiji Productivity Master Plan 2021 to 2036.  This Master Plan 
<br/>sets out milestones and directions to raise national productivity that will drive the strategies to realise 
<br/>the objective of maximising the productivity in the 20-year National Development Plan.  Overall, the 
<br/>University made much progress in 2019 and it is our hope that this momentum continues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I just want to look back into the history of Fiji National 
<br/>University. We all know that it started off as the Derrick Technical Institute and then it became Fiji 
<br/>Institute of Technology (FIT) and in 2009 by a Decree it became the national university of Fiji.  It 
<br/>was amended again in a Decree in 2010.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As indicated in the past, Mr. Speaker, all those Decrees that were passed by the regime at that 
<br/>time should have been brought into Parliament to be debated before they became Acts, but that was 
<br/>not to be.  All the Decrees automatically became Acts and laws of this country.  If it had been brought 
<br/>in  for  debate,  Mr.  Speaker,  SODELPA  would  have  prevailed  upon  the  powers  that  be  that  FNU 
<br/>should not compete against USP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two both serve a very small country like Fiji and for them to be competing does not serve 
<br/>the  country  well.  We  would  have  liked  FNU  to  focus  primarily  on  technology  and  the  regional 
<br/>university on the other areas.  We provide funding to both USP and FNU and it is a duplication and 
<br/>I believe funds not being fully utilised for its purpose that we are funding two institutions at that level 
<br/>that are competing with each other.  So, I would say today that in the future we would review this. 
<br/>We have always called for an Education Commission to be set up to decide on what  you need in 
<br/>terms of education in Fiji and it would be a subject that we could discuss, Mr. Speaker, as to separate 
<br/>the two and not for them to be competing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, education is very important for Fiji and I know it is a bit of a cliché but when 
<br/>you read this ADB Policy Paper and you will see how vulnerable the country is, the answer for us, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, is in education. We must educate our people.  We are limited in just about every area 
<br/>in the economy and the likes but we can make a difference if our people are educated. That is why 
<br/>SODELPA has established a policy that education will be free up to tertiary level because it is the 
<br/>only way out for the country and what we will be doing today, the difference will be realised in a big 
<br/>way in 10 to 20 years’ time - what will we leave for our future generations.  What we want to leave 
<br/>them, Mr. Speaker, is education and that is why SODELPA is committed to providing education to 
<br/></span><span>free tertiary level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When it came up for debate in the last sitting, Mr. Speaker, people were asking me how much 
<br/>will  it  cost.    My  people  had  done  the  sums  and  it  came  up  to  a  billion  dollars  for  the  whole  of 
<br/>education.  Later the honourable Minister for Education came out with their figures and she said as 
<br/>it is, the budget for education is $700 million and it would cost another $200 million to bring in free 
<br/>tertiary. So, her figure is $900 million, SODELPA’s figure is $1 billion. We are there and we know 
<br/>what it is all about and we know that we can find the money to provide free tertiary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, making some comparisons with other countries, Sri Lanka provides free 
<br/>tertiary.  Sri Lanka has a population of 20 million people and has 15 universities.  Also Barbados, 
<br/>one university which is the University of the West Indies similar in structure to the USP in Fiji, but 
<br/>in Barbados, they go as far as PhDs for free - all the way to Doctorates.  When I talk about education 
<br/>being the answer to Fiji which FNU will serve, I also look at a country that I admire a lot and that is 
<br/>Taiwan.  Taiwan is twice the size of Fiji in terms of land mass but 23 times more than Fiji in terms 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>447 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of population.  Taiwan today with its limited resources is one of the key producers of semiconductors 
<br/>in the world. It supplies 60 per cent of the computer chips worldwide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is what education does to a country.  In Taiwan the population 
<br/>is 23 million, there are 160 universities and education is cheap in Taiwan.  So, that is where Fiji 
<br/>should be heading, more education so that we can develop our country and survive in the days ahead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is scarcity in terms about everything we have in this country because of our size, we 
<br/>have the tyranny of distance as highlighted by the ADB Report but Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is 
<br/>going to be the key to all these and that is why SODELPA is going to introduce free education to 
<br/>tertiary level.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why we want to see FNU to be performing well but it needs 
<br/>to be realigned in terms of its offerings compared to USP but it is an institution that we will need to 
<br/>protect for our future generation and that is where SODELPA is headed, free education to tertiary 
<br/>level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am amazed at how they are always quick to point a finger at us that we do not understand 
<br/>what is happening, here we are cheap shots.  I am trying to bring in Taiwan as an example and they 
<br/>say, “Are you going to move to Taiwan?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also worried about the brainpower on the other side of the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That 
<br/>is my contribution to this.  Sir, FNU should be supported especially as SODELPA wants education 
<br/>to be key for the way forward for this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the Committee for its deliberations 
<br/>and the Report that is before us.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a former Associate Professor of the Fiji National 
<br/>University, I stand with pride in saying that there have been many graduates from the Fiji National 
<br/>University.  I would like to correct the honourable Leader of SODELPA in saying that it was formed 
<br/>out of FIT, actually it was not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you would just search,  you will see that it was formulated in 15</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2010 as an 
<br/>amalgamation of the Fiji School of Medicine which was established in 1885, Fiji School of Nursing 
<br/>in  1893,  Fiji  College  of  Advanced  Education  in  1947,  Fiji  College  of  Agriculture  in  1954,  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Institute of Technology in 1963 and Lautoka Teachers College in 1978.  It was not just to one, all the 
<br/></span><span>six came together, amalgamated and became the Fiji National University and this Government did 
<br/>it.  The discussion again just going back to debating on the thesis put  forward by the honourable 
<br/>Leader of SODELPA that why do we need another University? This is a nation where we have about 
<br/>10,000 of our children leaving Year 13 every year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- You were not listening! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R.GAVOKA.-  Sir, why we needed another University? I said, why do they compete! 
<br/>They should be running on separate lines, Mr. Speaker.   I think he should withdraw that, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>Wave the red card or something, please, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR.  I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, from what  I heard, he was challenging the 
<br/>reason why we should have two separate universities. For a nation such as ours, that nearly has 8,000 
<br/>Year 13 students coming out every year, why should we not have another university.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, there are countries all around the Pacific, they come towards Fiji, looking for 
<br/>us and seeing that we have the aptitude and competency to delivery on the many educational needs 
<br/>that they have. More importantly, as our honourable Chairman had said, in engaging in the National 
<br/>Development Plan, in making sure that we have graduates who have a real world impact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only has FNU come from there, but it has also managed to actually go 
<br/>into Postgraduate training. And I say this because we have a lot of our specialists now in the medical 
<br/>sector, including my friend on the other side, honourable Ratu Atonio Lalabalavu, he was also trained 
<br/>in the Postgraduate programme, and that is what FNU has been able to do - offer the Postgraduate 
<br/>programmes,  allow  us  to  have  local  training  in  the  Postgraduate  areas  and  we  must  continue  to 
<br/>support that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  very  glad  that  infrastructural  developments  continue,  especially  the  new  campus  in 
<br/></span><span>Labasa. We see that as a very important area for working with the College of Medicine, Nursing and 
<br/>Health Sciences in making sure that we have attachments available up in the North. We also see that 
<br/>as an opportunity for our Northern next health professionals to be trained rather than all having to 
<br/>come to Suva and giving them the opportunity in our facilities that are available in the North.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I thank the Committee for its deliberations and I commend the Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is before the House. Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROFESSOR. B.C. PRASAD.- I stand to make some brief comments. I actually agree 
<br/>with the honourable Minister for Health that the amalgamation of the Fiji School of Medicine with 
<br/>the Fiji National University was a good move. I, for one, believe that sometimes it is good to have 
<br/>competition and I think we have three universities.  I know when the University of Fiji was being set 
<br/>up and some of us were supporting the idea while I was still at USP, we were not seeing the creation 
<br/>of another University as a threat in terms of competition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we saw, Mr. Speaker, was the need to have more educational opportunities and create 
<br/>accessibility towards many students as possible. So, I think the role of FNU in terms of providing 
<br/></span><span>that kind of competition and following on its tradition of producing technical people was very, very 
<br/></span><span>important and remains a very important contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point I would like to make and I think the honourable Minister for Education when she 
<br/>will speak, she may want to answer some of this, these is the situation with the technical colleges. I 
<br/>know when it was set up under the former Minister for Education, honourable Dr. Reddy.  We did 
<br/>sound  some  warnings  as  to  its  sustainability  and  I  think  what  happened  was,  ultimately  the 
<br/>Government  decided  that  Technical  Colleges  would  be  absorbed  by  the  Fiji  National  University 
<br/>(FNU).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I thought it was kind of a sensible move, in the sense that like before, FNU would be 
<br/>able  to  create  that  stream  of  qualifications  right  up  to  the  Degree  that  they  have  now  but  also 
<br/>Certificates and Diplomas which will help us provide that kind of technical skills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For many years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had this Apprenticeship Scheme and I know there are 
<br/>so many people in my own family and from my settlement who were not that kind of people who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>449 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would have made it to the university, but they actually made it to Fiji Institute of Technology (FIT) 
<br/>and Fiji National Training Council (FNTC) at that time.  Many who had not been successful at the 
<br/>Fiji Junior level went on to becoming a mechanic, a plumber, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of them, Mr. Speaker, needless to say, acquired that qualification, then went into Stage 
<br/>1  and  Stage  2  of  the  then  FNTC  and  acquired  various  skills,  such  as  mechanics,  plumbers  or 
<br/>electricians.  Many of them,  of course, have left the country because Australia and New  Zealand 
<br/>actually found out that these people were very, very skilled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, given the situation that we are in right now, and we all know that in a situation where 
<br/>we are economically depressed and has been pointed out, it would be difficult for us to get back to 
<br/>pre-pandemic levels of employment and economic growth, not necessarily in a short period of time.  
<br/>I know I have met many young people who have lost their jobs, especially those who were part of 
<br/>the Technical Colleges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When many of those Technical Colleges were closed, the teachers did not have a job, but also 
<br/>a lot of people who would want to go back to the university would want to delay their employment 
<br/>prospects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a good thing, it is not necessarily a bad thing that they continue to upgrade their skill 
<br/>from certificate to a diploma to a degree, or even those with degrees, I know they would want to 
<br/>continue their postgraduate studies.  It is an important pathway for them to pursue until they are able 
<br/>to land a job which would be very good for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From that perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all universities are important - FNU is very important 
<br/>and I think as honourable Dr. Waqainabete pointed out, we have always rejoiced the quality of our 
<br/>medical degrees and diplomas that we used to offer and it remains an important pillar of our medical 
<br/>education in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am a bit disappointed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to what is happening and I think the 
<br/>Committee  is  quite  rightly  pointing  that  out  on  the  capital  projects.  I  have  raised  this  issue  in 
<br/>Parliament before on the way in which the capital projects have been managed.  I remember asking 
<br/>a question in Parliament and the honourable Acting Prime Minister then told me that the amount that 
<br/>they spent at the Labasa Campus, which is now overgrown with grass and basically a jungle - lies 
<br/>abandoned, I do not know when the FNU is going to get its capital grant to relook at how they can 
<br/>rescue that project.  It was an important project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it would be absolutely important for us to keep that in mind that right 
<br/>now and going forward for the next couple of years, technical education and education in general, 
<br/>especially for students who may want to upgrade their qualification because it is going to be very, 
<br/>very important and that is an area we should do our best not to cut funding.  If that is any place that 
<br/>we  need  not  cut  funding  would  be,  as  I  have  said  before  in  this  Parliament,  in  an  economically 
<br/>depressed situation is health, education and social welfare.  I think it is absolutely important that we 
<br/>keep a focus on them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point  I want  to  reiterate again,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, and  I hope that there can be  a 
<br/>review and we have talked about an Education Commission for a long time and since 2014, I have 
<br/>been talking about that.  The reason why we are talking about an Education Commission is because 
<br/>there are so many things that have been done over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last Education Commission we had was in 2000, so it is more than 20 years now.  There 
<br/>have  been  a  lot  of  reforms  within  the  education  system,  some  have  worked  and  some  have  not 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>worked, but we have not had a very holistic review of the whole education system right from the 
<br/>primary up to tertiary education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While it is important to provide the accessibility, it is also important to have quality because 
<br/>if we lose sight of the quality at all levels right from the primary school, secondary school to the 
<br/>university, we are not going to produce the kind of people that would be needed in the labour market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point I want to make in relation to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we pursue the effort 
<br/>to train as many people as possible, we will have this constant outflow of skilled people from this 
<br/>country. In fact, people are telling me that there is long lines of people trying to do the IELTS Test, 
<br/>the English Test, the policies that Australia and New Zealand are putting now in terms of attracting 
<br/>workers, we are likely to see an exodus of skilled young people leaving this country in the next few 
<br/>years.  We may not be able to stop them because they would obviously be looking at opportunities, 
<br/>many of them are looking at not just job opportunities but other things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of young people are telling me, “I want to leave”.  Some of my nephews and nieces in 
<br/>my own family who have good jobs, qualified who were not thinking of leaving are saying to me that 
<br/>they might leave because they see opportunity but they also feel that there are lack of opportunities 
<br/></span><span>here too.  So, we need to tie in the whole education process in order to give opportunities that our 
<br/></span><span>young people will have in this country and I would say that let us not be political about education. I 
<br/>mean, I would be the last one to talk about it in terms of making it a political gain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is an important sector.  It is probably the most important element of our journey towards 
<br/>becoming a successful country.  We can go back and say, “Look, past Governments did not do this, 
<br/>this Government did that” but we are all moving, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We cannot say what was being 
<br/>done in 1973.  I mean, the honourable Acting Prime Minister was talking about salaries.  I know 
<br/>Teachers in 1973 were paid $3,000, there was a major Job Evaluation Exercise. So, it is a time-bound 
<br/>thing, some things just happen over a period of time. I mean, this is a Government which has been in 
<br/>power for 15 years so they actually should talk about what they have done in 15 years.   
<br/></span></div>
