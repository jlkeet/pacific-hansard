<h3>REVIEW REPORT –MINISTRY OF YOUTH AND SPORTS 2018–2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – </span><span>MINISTRY OF YOUTH AND SPORTS 2018–2019 ANNUAL REPORT</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Youth and Sports 2018–
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 21st September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the core responsibility of the Ministry of Youth and 
<br/>Sports  is  to  establish  a  policy  environment  that  provides  strategic  support  systems,  initiatives  for 
<br/>personal development, character building, sports policy implementation, and community based youth 
<br/>led programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  has  put  in  place  opportunities  for  our  youth  to  be 
<br/>empowered and be self-sustainable through its mobile and specific skills, empowerment and capacity 
<br/>building  training  programmes.  These  programmes  within  the  Ministry  fill  a  vital  gap  and  are  for 
<br/>those youth who are not able to enroll in formal education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Youth and Sports, through the implementation of Youth Empowerment and 
<br/>Livelihood  programmes  has  provided  encouragement  and  support  to  youth  through  initiatives 
<br/>centered on development either through the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills, volunteer and work 
<br/>attachments and formal or informal employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Ministry  continues  to  offer  trainings  to  youth  through  its  five  Youth 
<br/>Training Centres around the country along with the community based mobile skills training in rural 
<br/>and urban communities. The trainings often run in coordination with other Ministries, particularly 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs to ensure the 
<br/>prudent and effective use of resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  the  Ministry  conducts  regular  monitoring  of  youth  groups  before  and  after 
<br/>training to ensure skills and knowledge obtained are put to practice and various youth groups are also 
<br/>assisted through funding support either directly through the Ministry or through donor funding to 
<br/>start their income generation projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  given  Fiji’s  young  population,  the  Ministry  carries  the 
<br/></span><span>responsibility of harnessing and channeling the untapped raw potential of Fiji’s young people and 
<br/></span><span>releasing them into productive areas of society where they can make a difference. And this is made 
<br/>possible  through  the  provision  of  trainings  to  develop  both  soft  and  hard  skills,  encouraging 
<br/>networking,  mentoring,  providing  opportunities  to  build  leadership  skills  through  local  level 
<br/>implementation and promoting entrepreneurship and innovation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  S.  MATANITOBUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  with  your  indulgence  to 
<br/>contribute to the motion before the House on the Ministry of Youth and Sports Annual Report for 
<br/>2018 – 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, may I thank the Chairman and the members of the Committee 
<br/>for  their  Report.    Nevertheless,  it  is  now  three  years  since  the  period  under  review.    It  is  most 
<br/>satisfactory,  Sir,  that  ministries  are  submitting  their  reports  late  to  this  august  House.    As  my 
<br/>colleague the honourable Rasova said yesterday, it is a breach of the Financial Management Act and
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>569 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an affront to taxpayers who fund the activities of the Government, that Ministries submit their reports 
<br/>after one or two years to the people’s House that approves their budget on time annually every July. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will focus my contribution on the work of the Ministry in the empowerment of youth, 
<br/>as  I  have  already  contributed.    This  morning  on  the  topic  of  sports  development  on  the  motion 
<br/>regarding  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission,  it  is  clear,  Sir,  that  the  sports  development 
<br/>responsibility of the Ministry is carried out primarily by the Sports Commission, Boxing Commission 
<br/>and Sports Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  making  reference  to  the  Youth  Training  Programme  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Youth and Sports, I wish to raise two points: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, if the Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports to inform this House on the status of 
<br/>the implementation of the National Youth Development Plan.  Secondly, the status of the aligning 
<br/>and  upgrading  of  youth  training  programme  using  the  achievements  of  Tutu  Youth  Centre  in 
<br/>Cakaudrove as a benchmark. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once  we  are  able  to  get  answers  on  these  two  important  matters,  I  think  we  can  create  a 
<br/></span><span>meaningful discussion the future development in Fiji. The youth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are an integral 
<br/></span><span>component of our society.  They are affected by all the legislations, policies and programmes of the 
<br/>Government.  Whilst, the majority of youth are not employed in the formal sector, they contribute to 
<br/>Government revenue directly and indirectly via taxes, fees, levies, fines, duties, tariffs and et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am encouraged by the many  youth groups who are now undertaking  youth farming on a 
<br/>collective and </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> basis all over Fiji, earning a living and contributing to their </span><span>vanua. </span><span>More 
<br/>importantly,  Sir,  it  is  the  youth  who  will  inherit  the  legacy  left  behind  by  the  Government  and 
<br/>therefore the voice of the youth matters, they must be heard and the Government must learn to listen 
<br/>to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  three  main  consequences  of  this  Government’s  poorly  planned  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented policies and programmes for our youth are:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty and high unemployment (youth have a higher unemployment rate than the general 
<br/>population); 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>High public debt that the youth will inherit and have to repay (most recently the Asian 
<br/></span><span>Development Bank raised its concern in the report on the decision to downgrade Fiji from 
<br/></span><span>C grade to B grade) ; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environmental exploitation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, in turn, is worsened by the high cost of living, inflation, over-regulation, excessive fees 
<br/>and charges, over-taxing, rampant destruction of our flora, fauna, natural resources and environment.  
<br/>The overarching mood of the youths specifically and the nation generally is that of resignation and 
<br/>migration.    It  appears  that  their  only  hope  is  to  travel  overseas  to  work  as  seasonal  workers  into 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand. In this regard, Fiji has been on the United States of America list for the 
<br/>seasonal worker programme but Government has not facilitated this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many  youth have lost their sense of belonging and ownership. This is the lowest sense of 
<br/>patriotic citizenship since our nationhood and the blame for this squarely lies on the Government and 
<br/>its leadership.  The British Statesman, Sir Winston Churchill said and I quote: “It is easy to deceive 
<br/>the youth because they believe in hope.”

<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, realising the maxim in full measure, the policies and programme floated in 
<br/>the Manifesto of the FijiFirst Party in 2014 and 2018 sought to raise the hope of our youth leading 
<br/>them to vote them but in turn the FijiFirst Government not only failed but betrayed the youth of Fiji 
<br/>for their own goods.  Today, those manifesto promises are proven hollow and are mocked by the 
<br/>youth as the ultimate </span><span>vesumona. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  last  March  we  debated  the  Auditor-General’s  Report  on  Government 
<br/>Departments including the Ministry for 2016, the Public Accounts Committee noted that the Ministry 
<br/>had issues with monitoring the various grants given to the youth groups.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  this  is  uncertain  and  unaccounted  issuance  of  tools,  farm 
<br/>implementation and allocation of leases or lands, plant machineries, fitting and equipment to those 
<br/>youth graduating from the Fiji College of Agriculture, Navuso Agriculture School and those trained 
<br/>and inducted under the National Youth Training Scheme and has deterred many capable youth from 
<br/>joining and befitting from such initiatives because at the end of the day, it all boils down whether 
<br/>there  is  enough  funding  to  cater  for  them  to  establish  and  start  a  new  life.    I  see  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister has been giving out farm implements once again. He is on the campaign trail for 2022.  Will 
<br/>the same issues arise in the Auditor-General’s Report for 2021 and 2022? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  Ministry  undertook  to  establish  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  to  review  its 
<br/>youth grant programme and I am hopeful this has been implemented by the Ministry.  Sir, the youth 
<br/>of today need jobs that is the best solution. While the Ministry’s Annual Report is very eye-catching 
<br/>with a lot of photos, the reality is that despite promising to empower youth to establish their own 
<br/>businesses to become self-employed in small and micro-businesses, the truth is very few youths from 
<br/>the thousands trained have successfully set up businesses. The Ministry seems to be carrying out a 
<br/>lot of activities in the rural areas with workshops and trainings but the same vocational training is 
<br/>offered at FNU.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While more youths are trained in the short courses, the question is how many can enter formal 
<br/>employment with these qualifications.  How may are supported to start their own businesses?  I would 
<br/>like the honourable Minister to answer this question in his response please.  Another ongoing issue, 
<br/>Sir, with the Ministry is the failure to develop sporting facilities around the two major islands and in 
<br/>the rural and maritime areas as pledged by the FijiFirst Party in its election manifesto in 2014.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I note the Ministry’s Annual  Report for 2018-2019 on page 51 states once again  that the 
<br/>construction of 100 rural sporting venues were delayed due to failure to appoint a consultant to assess 
<br/></span><span>the 10 grounds and changing requirement from the Ministry of Infrastructure I wonder what excuse 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister will offer today for the continuing delays.  Instead the Government wasted 
<br/>millions of dollars on the Natadola Golf extravaganza and the Super Rugby matches.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>the youth have now become delusional with the broken promises and the reality on the ground of 
<br/>poverty for which there is no relief because of the national debt.   It is also useful, Sir, to note that 
<br/>the Auditor-General’s Report noted year-in and year-out,  the same mistake and failures of internal 
<br/>controls and monitoring in not only this Ministry but across the board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  truth,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  the  public  service  reforms  have  failed.    Short-term 
<br/>contracts  have  failed  to  ensure  job  security  and  confidence.    The  removal  of  public  service 
<br/>examinations and training, in fact the removal of the whole Public Service Commission machinery 
<br/>and its replacement with a department of only a few staff compound the failure. Parts of the Public 
<br/>Service  Commission  functions  are  now  all  hived  into  the  super  Ministry  of  Economy.    It  is  any 
<br/>wonder then that we have confusion, malaise and fear in the public service.

<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>571 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Ministry of Youth and Sports where youth officers were laid off their jobs and their 
<br/>positions were re-advertised with another name but the same job description and reduced salaries.  I 
<br/>think I have put it out in my earlier speech to the Minister, Sir.  This kind of unfair, vindictive and 
<br/>unjust governance does the people of Fiji no favours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note with sadness that the same issue will come up again when it comes to the performance 
<br/>of the Government ministries and I urge all people not to be caught up in the hype and fear mongering 
<br/>of  the  coming  election  and  to  choose  wisely  for  their  future  generation.    And  I  thank  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  contribution  will  not  be  that  lengthy.    My 
<br/>honourable colleagues have made their substantive contributions including the honourable Members 
<br/>from the other side of the House.  Thank you to the Committee for this Report.  I guess one of the 
<br/>things that the Ministry could look at improving is their communications because I saw on today’s 
<br/>Facebook page.  They have followed through with an apology, they posted the condolence message 
<br/>to a former rugby player who is well and truly still alive which is Radovi from Lomanikoro, Rewa, 
<br/>mistaking him for Mosese Taga but I am glad that your Ministry, honourable Bala has retracted and 
<br/>they have apologised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  speaking  on  the  issue,  financial  literacy  is  very  important  and  I  agree  youth 
<br/>empowerment is very important looking at the ages between 18 years to 35 years.  And when they 
<br/>set up their businesses financial literacy is very important to ensure that the survival of a youth’s 
<br/>business especially when all the funding and all the grant is given, survives.  We know what it is like 
<br/>in our rural areas and we know the challenges they face and most of the challenges are regulatory 
<br/>requirements.  I am sure that the Ministry will be working or are working with the relevant authorities 
<br/>to ensure that training goes into these youth workshops so that they understand that there are legal 
<br/>regulatory requirements that they need to fulfil. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just the other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the late former Speaker and the former minister, Doctor 
<br/>Jiko Luveni had started, I believe the Women’s Expo and that was quite successful.   I used to enjoy 
<br/>going to those expos and perhaps this is something that the Ministry can look at, more so now since 
<br/>the COVID-19 protocols have relaxed, have a youth expo.  If there is one thing that this COVID-19 
<br/>has  taught  us,  it  is  the  talent  that  came  out  from  our  people  when  they  started  doing  their  own 
<br/>businesses.  We saw this, Mr. Speaker and perhaps that is something that the Ministry can look at, 
<br/>having  a  youth  expo, getting our  youths  together and so they  can showcase what  they have been 
<br/>taught or what they have.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just the other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed the issue of trainings done by the Ministry and 
<br/>I  commend  the  trainings  that  are  conducted.    I  trust  and  hope  that  these  trainings  are  accredited 
<br/>because we all recall, it was mentioned today or in the past two days, that there were some vocational 
<br/>trainings that were closed down, were under FNU because there was no accreditation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that when taxpayers money go into these workshops, at the end of the day, that 
<br/>person comes and knows that this training is very useful and this is the training that I can go and 
<br/>empower others because at the end of the day we do not want  a business concept, in the  </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>context </span><span>duri ga me davo. </span><span> It has to survive. There has to be sustainability and I am sure that we all 
<br/>agree on that.  I speak from the experience, not as a youthful one, although I look youthful because I 
<br/>have my own business, so it is important that we empower everybody mainly our youths. If anyone 
<br/>has gone through a very challenging time during these two years, our youth in our nation.   I commend 
<br/>the Committee for this Report.  Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. At the outset let me inform this honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>House that I have found out who had dug the hole but I am not going to reveal the name.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  on  the  points  that  has  been  raised  by  my  honourable  friend  on  the 
<br/>National Youth Development Plan which I will cover in my response.  Tutu comes under Ministry 
<br/>for Agriculture, funding is allocated by Ministry of Agriculture.  In terms of youth expo, we are not 
<br/>in  the  business  of  changing  name  because  at  the  moment  we  have  the  National  Youth  Summit 
<br/>whereby we get all the youths across the country for this summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now I wish to contribute on the Review of the Ministry of Youth and Sports 
<br/>Annual Report 2018-2019.  The Ministry of Youth and Sports has put in place opportunities for our 
<br/>youth to be empowered and self-sustainable through a whole range of a specific programmes aimed 
<br/>at empowerment and capacity building.  These programmes Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Ministry 
<br/>of Youth and Sports fill a vital gap and addresses youth who have not made it in the formal education 
<br/>sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To complement these, the Ministry of Youth and Sports remains committed to the youth and 
<br/>sports  development  through  the  establishment  of  a  conducive  policy  environment  that  provides 
<br/></span><span>initiatives  for  personal  development,  character  building,  sports  policy 
<br/>support  systems, 
<br/></span><span>implementation and community-based youth-led programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report for example outlines that in the specific skills training which was 
<br/>highlighted by the previous speaker at the five youth training centres and you will note in the Report 
<br/>that 145 youths graduated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the success rate in the non-formal training sector.  The Ministry of 
<br/>Youth  and  Sports  engages  in  all  Government  approaches  by  co-operating  with  a  number  of  line 
<br/>ministries and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was raised earlier in the morning that we need to work with the 
<br/>relevant ministries which we have been doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  for  example  outlines  the  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs in planning and implementing its youth development programmes.  An example of 
<br/>its collaboration is the implementation of Traditional Leadership Programme to youth in rural village 
<br/>by the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  recent  times,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  proactive  measures  for  the  food  security  through 
<br/></span><span>utilisation of community, land holdings, youth clubs and groups had benefitted from the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Youth and Sports outreach programme of funding agriculture enterprises through the provision of 
<br/>equipment and other relevant materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process has included co-operation with the Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs.  In  the  very  successful  Duke  of  Edinburgh  Scheme  where  we  had  a  record  number  of 
<br/>graduates in the past week, we have a very healthy collaboration with the Ministry of Education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  success  of  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports  is  through  our  youth  and 
<br/>through our sports.  As a policy and public guardian, we are rightfully proud of our achievement in 
<br/>taking our programmes across the length and breadth of Fiji.  This has been at the core of our activities 
<br/>to ensure balance and an even spread of activities, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This also means that we plan in 
<br/>a  proactive  manner  towards  the  high  achievements.    As  part  of  our  monitoring,  evaluation  and 
<br/>learning process, we were at the outset Mr. Speaker, Sir, through forums like the National Youth 
<br/>Summit better engage with our youths and to be able to listen to what they felt was needed for them 
<br/>and gear our programmes in an inclusive and consultative fashion. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>573 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  process  of  engagement  has  resulted  in  more  Ministry  of  Youth  and 
<br/>Sports programmes and reaching out to more Fijians. This began with the registration of the youth 
<br/>clubs which as at an end 2021, we have registered 801 youth clubs with the involvement of almost 
<br/>25,000 youths.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  this,  194  clubs  benefitted  from  the  Youth  Farm  initiative  with  almost  5,600  youths 
<br/>participating in this programme. In other words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, now 5,600 youths are engaged in 
<br/>farming and employment has been created.  I am so sad, I never expected from my good friend when 
<br/>he said that by us giving the equipment, we are campaigning! This is a direct insult to the youths of 
<br/>this country by the Opposition.  Here, there is a Government who is so concerned about the youths 
<br/>of this country reaching out to the unreached youths, providing them the requirements and here comes 
<br/>the Opposition saying that we are campaigning.  I want to put it on record, it is a direct insult to the 
<br/>youths of this country by the Opposition.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been reaching out to the unreached youths 
<br/></span><span>across the country, not only in Ba. Let me make it very clear to the honourable Member and let the 
<br/>people of Ba also hear from the Opposition that they are claiming that only these equipment are given 
<br/>in Ba. I want them to hear as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  we  are  going  to  assist  five  youth  clubs  with  boats  and  I  thank  the  Chinese 
<br/>Embassy for providing us with five boats. Here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 160 youths will benefit out of this 
<br/>assistance.  This  is  going  to  create  employment.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  line  with  the  Parliamentary 
<br/>Committee  Report  for  more  income  generation  projects  which  was  highlighted  by  the  earlier 
<br/>speakers. Projects in this sector, the Ministry has set-up a piggery and poultry farm.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This has again benefitted almost 120 youths. In addition, the Ministry has continued to expand 
<br/>its community outreach training of empowerment and mobile skills to more Fiji  youths. Between 
<br/>2020 and 2021, we have conducted 88 such trainings benefitting almost 3,500 youths. This was also 
<br/>raised by the earlier speaker in terms of training.  As noted in the parliamentary report for 2018 and 
<br/>2019, the Ministry of Youth  and Sport has implemented the principle of gender equality so as to 
<br/>ensure all matters are considered with regards to the impact and benefit on both men and women 
<br/>equally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The gender breakdown of the staff composition at the Ministry of Youth and Sports in 2018 
<br/>and  2019  financial  year  showed  equal  numbers  of  men  and  women  in  managerial  positions.  In 
<br/>addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all our programmes are audited in-house to encourage Gender equality 
<br/>with special measures in place such as intake into the training programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to thank you and the Chairman and members of the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-. I now call upon on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>affairs to speak in reply.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  providing  all  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- take the next agenda item, I just want to make a correction.  This morning 
<br/>I was a bit premature and erred in my announcement that there were no Bills today.  We have Bills 
<br/>today but we will take that after we take the Questions.  It means you and I have to be here a little 
<br/>while longer but we will be together, so there is no problem.
