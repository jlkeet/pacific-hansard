<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI NATIONAL SPORTS COMMISSION   
<br/>AUGUST 2018 - JULY 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Fiji National Sports Commission August 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018 – July 2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 20</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the activities of the Fiji National Sports Commission 
<br/>(FNSC)  are  twofold.  First,  the  Sports  Commission  is  responsible  for  guiding  and  enhancing  the 
<br/>delivery of sports programmes in Fiji through a coordinated approach at all levels of participation by 
<br/>Government  statutory  bodies  and  the  community.  Second,  it  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the 
<br/>development of sports in Fiji. The Sports Commission was established under the Fiji National Sports 
<br/>Commission Act of 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to achieve those objectives, the FNSC partners closely with the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Youth and Sports in particular, it’s Sports Unit. The Sports Unit within the Ministry oversees the 
<br/></span><span>National Policy and Regulation, while the Sports Commission investigates its development and is 
<br/>the lead implementer of the Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FNSC Executive Management informed the Committee that it will be 
<br/>reviewing  its  2019–2023  Strategic  Plan,  relooking  at  the  current  situation  and  working  more  in 
<br/>partnerships for sustainability. Its programmes continue to be redesigned to meet deliverables that 
<br/>are effective in the transformation of communities and individuals from grassroot level to elite.  Seed 
<br/>funding  at  the initial  stage of such Sports Commission  will allow other stakeholders to  buy in  to 
<br/>gaining  access  and  funding  of  projects  that  will  be  available  to  the  community  at  all  levels.  
<br/>Furthermore, the Urban Youth Sport Development Partnerships Programme has been successful in 
<br/>using sports to raise awareness and assist in the development of young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  the  national  concern  to  reduce  Non-  Communicable  Disease  (NCD)  in  the 
<br/>country, FNSC has partnered with Diabetes Fiji to use sports as a platform to educate, collect data 
<br/>and create awareness at the Diabetes Awareness Event, for youths and all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generally, the Committee is satisfied with the operations of the FNSC in 2018-2019 and in 
<br/></span><span>particular, the extensive work undertaken by the Commission to engage a wide segment of the Fijian 
<br/></span><span>population in its sporting programmes and activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the  floor is now open for debate on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  I  would  like  to  commend  the  Committee  for  their  review  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Auditor-General’s Report.  I have three issues that I would like to speak on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first they have highlighted in the Auditor-General’s Report the challenges 
<br/>of data collection of the migration of youth from the urban to the rural and more so now.  I note in 
<br/>the Auditor-General’s Report that the Commission is working on that, they are going to work with 
<br/>the  NGOs.    Now  given  that  we  have  the  </span><span>turaga  ni  koro</span><span>  who  are  paid  for  by  Government,  the 
<br/>Commission  should  look  at  working  with  them</span><span> </span><span>to  get  information  back,  and  I  am  sure  that,  that 
<br/>information will be readily available.  Also, in terms of costs, it will reduce costs and also duplicity 
<br/>of expenses for the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2018-July 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>497 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one, Sir, was the grant.  We all know that the FNSC gives out grant to sporting 
<br/>bodies.  Just this week, I read on the Government </span><span>Facebook</span><span> Page the Charitable Trust that had been 
<br/>deregistered by the Registrar and one of the sporting bodies that has been deregistered is the Fiji 
<br/>Netball Association (FNA).  We know that netball is one of the main sports in our nation, second to 
<br/>rugby.  We have a lot of our women and men as well, who participate in this sport, including our 
<br/>youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given what I have been told, the lodgment of the audited accounts of the FNA was lodged 
<br/>with  the  FNSC.    Now,  under  the  law  there  is  a  requirement  that  you  lodge  with  the  relevant 
<br/>government body. Perhaps, to ensure that there is efficiency within the FNSC because they are giving 
<br/>out grants, that prior to giving out grants they must ensure that all regulatory requirements of all these 
<br/>sporting associations is met, and this is just similar to us lawyers, that prior to us getting our Practising 
<br/>Certificate, we have to ensure that we have a Certificate of Compliance from the tax authority and 
<br/>from the FNPF.  So, when a grant is requested to the FNSC, they ensure that, that Association has 
<br/>fulfilled all the regulatory requirements before a grant is issued.  I believe that works better as well, 
<br/>but also for efficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  on  Board  appointments.    I  always  highlight  about 
<br/></span><span>gender issues and it is important that we have gender balance, but I note for this audited Report, there 
<br/></span><span>were five Board members who had been appointed from 2013 until present.  So until present is when 
<br/>the  audited  Reports  were  released.    I  do  not  know  whether  those  five  Board  members  who  were 
<br/>appointed in 2013 are still the Board members of the FNSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, in our nation we have so many people, so many talents and depths of knowledge, it 
<br/>is always good to have a rotation after a term or, at least, two terms.  And I pray that the five Board 
<br/>members who were appointed from 2013 are still not holding positions until today, because there is 
<br/>a pool of people in our nation that we can always pull from to sit on these Board appointments.  That 
<br/>is my contribution to this Report.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to 
<br/>speak on the motion.  If I may begin by commending the Chairman and honourable Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs on their reviewing  the activities of  the Fiji National Sports 
<br/>Commission  and  their  report,  covering  the  period      2018  to  2019.    The  principle  activity  of  the 
<br/>Commission  is  to  guide  and  enhance  the  delivery  of  sports  programme  through  a  coordinated 
<br/>approach at all levels for the development of sports in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impact of COVID-19 and the economic downturn we are going through, 
<br/></span><span>has had a terrible effect on the development of sports in our nation.  The third wave, where 117 lives 
<br/>have  been  lost  so  far,  and  the  limitation  on  sports  activities  remain  a  tragedy,  although  most 
<br/>restrictions have been lifted last Sunday by the honourable Acting Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we remain concerned about the grants to sporting bodies that were returned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the third and fourth quarter last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless,  I  must  commend  the  Commission  for  its  activities  and  achievements  in  the 
<br/>period under review, 2018-2019 financial year.  It performed above its target in most areas and for 
<br/>this, I commend the Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  turn  to  the  Committee’s  recommendations.    With  regards  to  the 
<br/>budgetary allocation to the Commission, I wholeheartedly agree that their allocation be increased, 
<br/>when this pandemic is finally contained.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2018-July 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the same vein, I urge the Government that the Commission should be 
<br/>able to provide funding for the construction and maintenance of grounds, courts and related facilities.  
<br/>We  must  grow  sports  and  the  lack  of  sports  facilities  has  always  been  an  obstacle  to  sports 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, urge the Government to relook at the budgetary grant to the 
<br/>Commission,  to  assist  them  to  deliver  better  services  and  enable  the  execution  of  its  sports 
<br/>programmes and activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  also  agree  that  during  this  time  of  restricted  activities,  the  Commission  should  also 
<br/>consult  with  the  national  sporting  bodies,  as  the  Committee  has  recommended.  This  consultation 
<br/>should become part of its work all the time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Report and the recommendation to the House. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion in the debate of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018-2019 Annual Report for the Fiji National Sports Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, I just like to mention that our youth population is about 32 per 
<br/>cent of the total population. The Ministry responsible for the FNSC is the Ministry of Youth and 
<br/>Sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Ministry is one of those Ministries that  is  given a very small portion of the National 
<br/>Budget.  Out of that National Budget that is given to the Ministry, about $12 million is given as grant 
<br/>to the FNSC, considering that sports is a very big agent for the development and empowerment of 
<br/>our youth and also a recognisable income generating avenue for our people, particularly our youth, 
<br/>in the very different sports that is supported by the FNSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  having  said  that,  I  will  just  make  mention  of  the  importance  of  sporting 
<br/>infrastructure, like the construction of playing fields or the </span><span>rara </span><span>in our urban residential communities 
<br/>and  also  in  the  maritime  and  rural  communities.  I  believe  the  FNSC  do  undertake  Sports 
<br/>Development Programmes in the various communities, particularly with their outreach programmes 
<br/>to the rural population, but they can only be really successful in this aspect of their work if there is 
<br/>proper infrastructure in place in regards to the </span><span>rara</span><span> or playing fields. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will recall that in my maiden speech in 2015, I had highlighted the need for sporting fields 
<br/></span><span>or </span><span>rara</span><span> in the residential areas, like Caubati, Wainivula, Kinoya and along the Suva/Nasinu corridor, 
<br/>and even Nasinu/Nausori corridor.  Those are density populated communities with our youth, and 
<br/>there is a big demand for proper sporting infrastructure to be established in those areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there is a great demand for the establishment of </span><span>rara</span><span> in the various schools in the rural 
<br/>and maritime areas because part of FNSC’s activities is their outreach to schools and it would really 
<br/>help them in their work if the Government increase their $12 million grant to, at least, $15 million, 
<br/>so  that  they  are  able  to  look  after  the  proper  establishment  of  playing  fields  in  the  various 
<br/>communities.  For example, even for the Kadavu sports infrastructure development, about $500,000 
<br/>is being funded by the FNSC and that highlights the cost that could be very high in the establishment 
<br/>of  these  playing  fields  only  with  the  Government  support,  particularly  in  regards  to  its  grant 
<br/>contribution to the FNSC.  Then only the FNSC will be able to do a good job or to be able to improve 
<br/>and develop the lives in the sporting aspect of our rural population, particularly with our youth.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2018-July 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>499 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another important aspect that is highlighted in the Report is the  need for the Commission to 
<br/>strengthen its partnership with various ministries like the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Education so that they could work together 
<br/>and  in  partnership  to  be  able  to  contribute  in  the  development  and  improvement  of  the  sporting 
<br/>infrastructures in our various communities to allow or to help the Commission in really making an 
<br/>impact in improving the lives of our youths through sports in our various communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I call on the Government, I know the Minister for Economy is not here and he is always 
<br/>highlighting  the  fact  that  I  bring  up  the  budget  and,  yes,  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  important  that  the 
<br/>Government  allocates  sufficient  funding  to  these  type  of  organisations  that  really  look  at  the 
<br/>empowerment and development of our youths through sports.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I am very happy to be the cause 
<br/>of some de-stressing laughs this morning.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the Committee for the Report 
<br/>and also I would like to congratulate them and also the Commission for the way they have been able 
<br/>to  drive  through  with  the  programmes  that  they  have  been  able  to  do  and  their  coordination 
<br/>component in these challenging times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we look at the motives and the reasoning for the Commission.  There are four important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Guide sports in the country; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Enhance it;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Coordinate it; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Develop it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And throughout this COVID-19 pandemic sports all around the world has struggled and we 
<br/>all know that some of our favourite games we have not been able to watch and it is not limited to 
<br/>Fiji.  It is all around the world and I have been watching with interest because just like the many of 
<br/>us here, I am an avid fan and I have also realised that in my readings that the support that has gone 
<br/>into sports for major sponsors, development of infrastructure all around the world has also in a way 
<br/>struggled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And so I must congratulate the Commission and also the Ministry of Youth and Sports in the 
<br/>way that they have been able to do the programmes that they are able to do before COVID-19.  The 
<br/>many  sports  facilities  that  we  have  available  and  the  maintenance  that  happens.    For  example  to 
<br/></span><span>ensure that our major sports facilities here in the Laucala Bay Complex are of a magnificent look and 
<br/></span><span>in terms of the ability to be able to use it.  During the midst of the COVID-19 we were able to use 
<br/>these facilities as a surge facility.  We were able to use it because it met our criteria.  It was not a 
<br/>hospital but it met our criteria.  It was clean enough, it was spacious enough, it was ventilatory enough 
<br/>for us to be able to use it. And we used both, all the sports facilities that were in the Laucala Bay 
<br/>Complex. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  I  thank  the  Commission  and  I  also  thank  the  Ministry  for  Sports  for  the  magnificent 
<br/>structure that we have in place and I know for sure that they have their own strategy, they have their 
<br/>plan in place, now that the economy is going through its recovery.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, coordination as 
<br/>part of what the Commission is supposed to do is very important and we have partnered very well 
<br/>with the Commission.  This is so important in this day and age.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  I  encourage  all  sports  committees,  all  clubs  to  ensure  that  they  work  through  that 
<br/>process  because  health  and  prevention  of  sports  injuries  and  rehabilitation  is  a  very  important 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2018-July 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>component.  Most of those that are playing sports as we all know are young Fijians and they have a 
<br/>whole life ahead of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to ensure as the Ministry of Health that they enjoy their sports, that they are able to 
<br/>earn an income if they can but more importantly that they can help live a long and fulfilling life after 
<br/>sports.  That is why our coordination with the Commission has been very important.  Before COVID-
<br/>19 and also through COVID-19 with the COVID-19 safe sports measures that are in place and also 
<br/>the other measures around injuries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To give you an example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our doctors and our health professionals not only 
<br/>in the private sector but also in the public sector have been working with the Fiji Rugby Union and 
<br/>some of our doctors have sat the important exams to be able to be certified by World Rugby, so some 
<br/>of the test matches that have happened before COVID-19 actually had some of our doctors there on 
<br/>the sidelines having met that criteria and that is also very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to be able to minimise injuries to the neck so that we reduce those who have 
<br/>significant injuries to make them disabled and that is one of the important roles of the Commission 
<br/>in coordinating and the health, and the prevention of disability and also the notification of injuries 
<br/></span><span>that can be picked up early and the health protection that is there, available on the ground even before 
<br/></span><span>and the advocacy that happens before it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Commission for their work despite the challenging times.  I thank 
<br/>the line ministry and also I thank the honourable Members of Parliament who are Members of the 
<br/>Committee for the Report that is before us and I support it.  Thank you Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the Annual 
<br/>Report of the Fiji National Sports Commission.  I note the principal activity.  As noted, to guide and 
<br/>enhance the delivery of sports programmes in Fiji through a coordinated approach at all levels of 
<br/>participation by Government, statutory bodies, communities, et cetera, and I note in the NDP that 
<br/>there was the intention to host the Pacific Games 2023 and the Commonwealth Games 2026, so I am 
<br/>not sure how far that has gone regarding that situation given the COVID-19 and other challenges we 
<br/>are facing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  particular  interest  Sir,  is  one  of  the  findings  and  recommendations  there  that  the 
<br/>Commission  assist  individual  sporting  bodies  to  improve  their  financial  resources  and  technical 
<br/>expertise  to  boost  their  performance.    Funding  provided  for  overseas  trainers,  bring  short-term 
<br/></span><span>experts  to  come  to  Fiji  has  greatly  assisted  in  bringing  not  just  athletes  to  better  results  but  also 
<br/></span><span>provide the training for their coaches. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to speak in particular on the overseas coaches.  We have seen consistently that 
<br/>overseas coaches have been appointed for some of our sporting bodies in particular netball and from 
<br/>the rugby side, I have been president of Fiji Rugby Union at one stage and also currently patron of 
<br/>one of our local rugby unions – the Rewa Rugby Union and in terms of overseas coaches, there have 
<br/>been concerns expressed regarding the appointment and engagement of overseas coaches and there 
<br/>is substantial funding from the Commission in this regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I question the Commission if there is any framework for the development of local coaches up 
<br/>to the level of the overseas coaches.  I am not questioning the appointment of some of these coaches 
<br/>but I am just wondering whether there is a framework within for succession planning and there have 
<br/>been various coaches who have been mentored within Fiji Rugby Union through the various World 
<br/>Cups.  We  have  had  a  local  coach  some  years  back  but  since  then  the  trend  has  been  to  engage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2018-July 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>501 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overseas coaches.  Even though some coaches have been mentored but they have not graduated up 
<br/>to the level as national coach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I believe there is a role there for the Commission to assess the situation. What are the 
<br/>reasons for this and what are the reasons for our local coaches not reaching that national coach level.  
<br/>It could be because of the accredited training or they have not reached the level required maybe level 
<br/>three or four.  I am requesting the Commission to please oversee this and have better scrutiny of this 
<br/>in terms of assisting, graduating our local coaches, having a succession plan and framework in place 
<br/>so that there are clear timelines that at some stage there will be a local coach for our national rugby 
<br/>teams both 15s and 7s and that can only happen I suppose if the Minister can oversee this in their 
<br/>work plan and have some timelines on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  local  sporting  organisations,  Sir.  For  example  in  rugby  we  have  our  bigger 
<br/>provincial unions such Suva, Nadroga, et cetera, but there are other rugby unions at the lower level 
<br/>and they face huge  challenges.   For  example Tailevu North,  Northland Tailevu and Rewa  at  that 
<br/>level.  Tailevu is at the higher level facing huge challenges and I believe that there is a role here for 
<br/>the Commission in assessing the challenges they face. For example, in my experience for the last 20 
<br/></span><span>years or so years as an administrator at this level, at a particular rugby union - the Rewa Rugby Union 
<br/></span><span>which comes from  B-Division to A-Division and goes up and down. So, one of the issues we face, 
<br/>firstly it is ground availability and I believe the Ministry is working on some of that even though it 
<br/>is  late  on  Naluwai  and  Kadavu.    I  believe  that  there  is  funding  there  but  there  needs  to  be  more 
<br/>funding for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, most of the grounds that we are using is owned by schools.  I acknowledge 
<br/>the role of our schools in that.  Tailevu has used Nakelo.  We are using Burebasaga District School 
<br/>and a few other schools. In Naitasiri North, they are using Naluwai. There is a huge problem in that 
<br/>not only that but also in the administration of these unions and sports bodies mostly which are based 
<br/>in the rural areas, it is very difficult to get sponsors because sponsors go for big names and mileage.  
<br/>So, there is huge sponsorship for our Nadroga maybe Suva teams and even some of our clubs such 
<br/>as Police and Army but for us it is quite difficult for these unions and that sponsorship is required for 
<br/>the day to day preparation of the teams in terms of, as you know, Sir, it is quite demanding now, the 
<br/>programmes they follow off-season and also in the preparation for the competition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only that but also in terms of facilities,  rugby is very demanding physically, so they need 
<br/>to be well-prepared and each provisional union needs to have a high performance centre or weights 
<br/></span><span>centre.  Again, the Commission could come in and assist by doing a needs assessment of all the issues 
<br/></span><span>I have raised and even with the setting up of these higher performance facilities at the provincial 
<br/>level.    They  could  assist  in  terms  of  funding  and  maybe  other  assistance  such  as  when  you  are 
<br/>importing for example weights, some assistance in that regard or concessions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those, Sir, are some of the issues I thought I would raise.  It is not only for us but also for the 
<br/>maritime provinces.  For example, we have not had the island zone, Lau, Lomaiviti, a few others, 
<br/>Gau, et cetera, for competition for a while because of the challenges that I have raised.  I hope that 
<br/>the Sports Commission, though they seem to be focusing at the national leads, at that level, maybe 
<br/>they need to come down, do an assessment of needs at the provincial level, particularly with the rural 
<br/>communities and create programmes from that in order to assist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.  VEGNATHAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  is 
<br/>responsible for guiding and enhancing sports programmes in Fiji and ensuring the implementation.  
<br/>This  is  done  through  strategic  and  structured  partnership  with  the  relevant  government  statutory 
<br/>agencies and communities in general so as to develop sports in the country.

<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2018-July 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  our  deliberation  on  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  August 
<br/>2018 - July 2019 Annual Report, some interesting findings were made which I would like to expound 
<br/>on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First,  the  Committee  noted  the  assiduous  work  of  the  Sports  Commission  in  helping  our 
<br/>athletes  and  sport  teams  participate  at  international  sporting  events.    I  commend  the  Sports 
<br/>Commission for all the work done in helping lift the world ranking of our athletes and sports teams.  
<br/>The Sports Commission works at facilitating funding to enable our national teams to attend these 
<br/>world ranking events, together with Government assistance, of course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I also note that a number of our sports have shown improvement, but other sports have very 
<br/>much become professional,  and our individual athletes have shown their  ability to  become world 
<br/>class athletes, as seen with Rugby Union, Rugby League, Football and Golf.  Funding provided for 
<br/>overseas trainers to come to Fiji as short term experts has greatly assisted, not just athletes to achieve 
<br/>better results, but has also provided training opportunities for our coaches.  As honourable Tuisawau 
<br/>has  mentioned,  our  coaches  probably  need  more  training  and  perhaps  they  may  be  given  the 
<br/>opportunity to be trained under some coaches overseas, maybe that will improve their ranking and 
<br/>enable them to become better and high grade coaches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  scholarships  provided  have  enabled  athletes  to  improve  their  ranking  by 
<br/></span><span>competing and training with overseas athletes and coaches.  The international coaching grant, for 
<br/>example, has enabled teams to advance their ranking and the results are evident in improved ranking 
<br/>for rugby, football, yachting and surfing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another noteworthy achievement of the Sports Commission has been the formulation of its 
<br/>strategic plan for 2019 to 2024, following extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I commend the Commission for the many different sporting activities created for the 
<br/>benefit of our Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  comment  on  the  Fiji  National  Sports 
<br/>Commission  2018-2019 Annual  Report  and thank the Chairman and members of the Committee. 
<br/>Concerns have been raised in regards to the urban-rural migration of youths, that the Fiji National 
<br/>Sports Commission needs to work closely with the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> and the village elders.  I wish to 
<br/>state that that is happening.  We are working very closely with the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> and the village 
<br/>elders in that regard.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other concern that was raised was on the registration of the National 
<br/></span><span>Sporting Organisation. It is standard practice that all boxes need to be ticked before registration is 
<br/></span><span>accepted and if they fulfil all the requirements they are registered. So, I do not see any issue in that 
<br/>regard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue that was raised was on the appointment of board members.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>all  the  board  members  of  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  are  appointed  on  merit  and  upon 
<br/>expiry, their term can be renewed. So, it is not an issue of whether they have been there for three or 
<br/>four years, if they are doing a good job, they can continue being board members.  And here I would 
<br/>like to thank the members of the Fiji National Sports Commission for their hard work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other concern was raised on the capital development. I would like to say 
<br/>this to the honourable Salote Radrodro that it is not the job of the Fiji National Sports Commission 
<br/>to go around the country and build multipurpose courts or sports grounds; it is the Ministry of Youth 
<br/>and Sports and CIU Unit.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>503 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me also say this, I really like what the honourable Attorney-General said the other day 
<br/>about the  Opposition Members that when they come into this honourable House to  debate,  they 
<br/>need to do some search, research and homework so that they are aware of what is happening in and 
<br/>around them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have constructed multi-purpose courts around the country, volleyball 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>courts and the sports field as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there  has been  also  some talks  on the local  coaches.   We all want  local 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coaches and we hope that a day will come when we will have local national coaches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the report noted that the principal activity of the Fiji Sports Commission is 
<br/>to guide and enhance the delivery of the sports programme in Fiji through a coordinated approach at 
<br/>all  levels  of  participation  by  Government  statutory  bodies  and  the  community  to  ensure  the 
<br/>development of sports in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the above, the Fiji Sports Commission has through its 2019-2023 
<br/>Working  Plan  has  relooked  at  is  operating  towards  greater  income  generation  beyond  its  current 
<br/>funding model.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These plans of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have been greatly impacted by the current pandemic 
<br/>and measures taken in its control. However, we remain confident that the Fiji Sports Commission 
<br/>will continue to work on this plan in the coming months towards sports under the new normal post-
<br/>COVID. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Sports  Commission  Programmes  had  been  redesigned  as  per  it  is 
<br/>mandate to facilitate sports in communities and individuals from the grass root levels to elite. One 
<br/>such example is the community sports association and we remain positive that we will continue to 
<br/>enable this change.  It is an area, Mr. Speaker, that the Ministry will work closely with Fiji Sports 
<br/>Commission so that we can get this programme to fulfil its aims of providing seed funding to grow 
<br/>community sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key priority area that the Fiji Sports Commission will continue to work on is partnership 
<br/>and funding towards specific programmes especially in the communities for women, children and 
<br/>inclusive development programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in making this contribution, it is important that we make the point that sports 
<br/></span><span>has shown pathways to better life outcomes even during the darkest days of this pandemic.  None 
<br/></span><span>better than the achievements of our gold and bronze winning performance by the men and women’s 
<br/>sides in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these highlights have been matched by local sports at all levels and have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continued to brighten the day for ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has made youth and sports front and centre of its 
<br/>keys priority areas and through this debate and given the current circumstances, it gives us hope when 
<br/>we know that sports and our youths are shining lights no matter what goes on in the world.  They 
<br/>will continue to shine brightly as we all strive toward greater achievements among our youths and in 
<br/>sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture  I  would  also  like  to  mention  that  now  the  sporting 
<br/>organisations,  religious  organisations  or  anyone  for  that  matter  can  organise  indoor  and  outdoor 
<br/></span></div>
