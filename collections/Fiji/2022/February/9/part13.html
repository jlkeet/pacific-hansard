<h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK</h3>
<div><span>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir , for the purpose of Section 145 of the 
<br/>Fijian Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament approves that -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fijian Government guarantee Fiji Development Bank (FDB) borrowings for the 
<br/>next  12  month  period.  From  1</span><span>st</span><span>  March,  2022  to  28</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023  through  the 
<br/>issuance  of  short  and  long-term  bonds  promissory  notes,  term  deposits,  any  RBF 
<br/>financing facility and other short term borrowings; 
<br/>the Government guarantee the sum of $200 million for the guarantee period; and  
<br/>a guarantee fee of 0.075 per cent be applied on a cumulative utilised guarantee credit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU:- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know and we have talked about 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Development Bank (FDB) in the past couple of days, the Bank was established under the Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank Act 1966 and opened for business on 1st July, 1967.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pursuant to section 5 of the Act, the function of the Bank is to facilitate and stimulate the 
<br/>promotion and development of natural resources, transportation and other industries and enterprises 
<br/>in Fiji, and in the discharge of these functions, the Bank shall give special consideration priority to 
<br/>the economic development of the rural and agricultural sectors of the economy of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank is  currently  under the supervision  of the Reserve  Bank of  Fiji 
<br/>(RBF) effective from 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2019 and as agreed, provided the six monthly reporting to the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on section 16(3) of the Act states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The repayment of any sums borrowed under the provisions of this section and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the payment of the interest thereon may be guaranteed by the Government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As required under section 62(1) of the Financial Management Act 2004, the Government may 
<br/></span><span>guarantee  the  financial  liability  of  any  entity  in  respect  of  a  loan  or  otherwise,  but  only  if  the 
<br/>guarantee is approved by Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022 Government guarantee request from the Bank will: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enable continued facilitation of the Fijian Government’s policy by lending to essential 
<br/>sectors of the economy, particularly resource-based sectors including; agriculture, mining 
<br/>and  quarrying,  manufacturing,  transport,  communications  and  storage  and  small  and 
<br/>micro  enterprises,  in  wholesale,  retail  and  hotels,  sustainable  energy  from  fossils  to 
<br/>renewable  sources  and  professional  and  business  services  which  will  assist  the 
<br/>disadvantaged of the community to earn a decent livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  will  ensure  that  the  Bank  lend  to  the  resource-based  sector  that  will  assist  in  the 
<br/>development of the agriculture sector and in the long run, assist the development of the 
<br/>Fijian economy.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ensure that the Bank’s borrowings are guaranteed by the Fijian Government, therefore, 
<br/>reducing the perceived risk associated with such borrowings, because they do go out to 
<br/>the open market.  This will make the Bank’s and instruments more attractive to investors, 
<br/>and should reduce the cost of borrowings for the Bank.  I think a lot of people may not 
<br/>understand this, but once the Government guarantees, the ability to go out to the market 
<br/>to give the investors that level of assurance, so they do not necessarily demand for high 
<br/>interest rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ensure  the  guarantee  of  the  Bank’s  proposed  term  deposits  which  will  build  investor 
<br/>confidence, and will thus have the Bank to manage its own liquidity position as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as required, I wish to inform Parliament of the Bank’s lending portfolio.  As 
<br/>at 3</span><span>rd</span><span> June, 2021, the Bank recorded a cumulative loan portfolio of $618.8 million, in other words, 
<br/>4,590 loan accounts, compared to $541.9 million in the 2020 financial year.  The gross loan for the 
<br/>financial  year 2021 is attributed to 45.76 per cent or $283.2 million of the focussed sector, while 
<br/>54.24 per cent of the non-focussed sector or $335.6 million was, in fact, the position of the Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of June 2021, in the Agriculture Sector, for example, there were 3,007 
<br/></span><span>loans which accounted for 65.51 per cent of total loan numbers.  In terms of the dollar value, the 
<br/></span><span>dollar value was $101.26 million, which accounted for 16.36 per cent of the dollar value that was 
<br/>overall lent by the Bank.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Manufacturing, for example, had 49 loan accounts which is about 1.07 per cent of the total 
<br/>loan accounts.  The total money lent in this sector was $46.42 million, which is about 7.5 per cent of 
<br/>the total value of loans lent out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mining and Quarrying, there were four loan accounts with a total value of $90,000.  The value 
<br/>of it is $710,000 and the value of the percentage of loan is 0.11 per cent.  There are numerous others 
<br/>but I have just, sort of, listed those and I could answer any other any other queries that may be on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just by way of general reference, in the non-focussed sector, the number of loans was 738, 
<br/>which accounted for 16.1 per cent of the total  loan numbers.   In terms  of the dollar value of the 
<br/>monies lent in this sector, it was $335.63 million, which accounted for 54.24 per cent of the total 
<br/>monies lent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank continues to hold on to the highest market shares with the lending 
<br/></span><span>in the Agriculture Sector at 50.61 per cent in this financial year.  The Bank continues to dominate the 
<br/></span><span>sugarcane farmers’ portfolio at 90.7 per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the breakdown of the new approvals in the Agriculture Sector 
<br/>during this financial year, in 2021 the number of new loans given out was 645, percentage was 71.7 
<br/>per cent, the total dollar value of $17.25 million and the percentage of money lent was 26.22 per cent.  
<br/>Just by reference, in 2020, the number of new loans in the Agriculture Sector was 596, percentage 
<br/>was 61.7 per cent with the total value of $16.62 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, between the periods of August 2021 to December 2021, the Bank assisted 
<br/>4,258 Fijians under the Disaster Rehabilitation Containment Facility Credit Guarantee Scheme with 
<br/>total loans valued at $58.7 million, of which $19.5 million was given to  micro enterprises; $16.2 
<br/>million  to  small  enterprises;  $13.3  million  to  medium  enterprises;  and  $9.7  million  to  large 
<br/>enterprises under the Scheme.  As we know, the RBF lends at 0.25 per cent and the Bank can lend at 
<br/>no more than 3.99 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>507 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this Scheme, we pay the interest rate for the borrowers for the first 
<br/>two years on their behalf, and there is no principal repayment that they have to do for the first two 
<br/>years.  So, essentially, if you borrow money now and if it is approved then, in the next two years you 
<br/>do not make any repayments to help you get back on your feet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank’s consolidated profit for the 2021 financial year amounted to $1 
<br/>million, a decline by 13 per cent when compared to the $1.1 million profit achieved in the previous 
<br/>financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total asset base stood at $607.5 million as at financial year 2021, an increase by 12 per 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cent when compared to the $540.6 million in the 2020 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our total liabilities also increased to $433 million, an increase by 18 per cent when compared 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to $367 million in the 2020 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the increase in total assets and total liabilities, the total share and equity also increased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by 1 per cent to $174.6 million in the 2021 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As at the end of financial year 2021, the Bank had total cash and cash equivalent of $75.4 
<br/></span><span>million, an increase by 19 per cent when compared to the  2020 financial year.  The increase was 
<br/>attributed to the net increase of $11.9 million in cash during the financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bank’s  total  forecasted  outlay  for  the  guaranteed  period  amounts  to 
<br/>$262.3 million, and I have got the table that actually does give the breakdown on that.  Given that 
<br/>the inflow forecasted is $62.3 million, the Bank requires an additional $200 million to finance the 
<br/>total outlay of $262.3 million.  The additional $200 million will be raised with the issuance of bonds, 
<br/>promissory notes, term deposits, any RBF financing facility and other short-term borrowings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bank also plans to repackage its SME loans to assist eligible businesses by offering low 
<br/>interest rates, as rice farmers in the North are also being assisted either to start or expand their farming 
<br/>operations, or to invest in improving efficiency through mechanisation. Of course, this is not only 
<br/>restricted to rice farmers, but many of the farmers in the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This guarantee will ensure that the Bank assist its 8,000 plus customers, while allowing the 
<br/>Bank  flexibility  to  optimise  its  borrowings  mix  to  reduce  its  cost  of  borrowing  and  achieve  an 
<br/>optimum maturity profile structure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bank’s  total  outstanding  liabilities  guaranteed  by  the  Fijian  Government  as  at  31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>December, 2021 amounts to $344.2 million.  This comprises 39 per cent or $134.6 million in bonds, 
<br/>30 per cent of $102.1 million in term deposits and 31 per cent or $107.6 million in RBF financing 
<br/>facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amount of loans we have guaranteed is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 - $330 million; 
<br/></span><span>2018 - $160 million; 
<br/></span><span>2019 - $160 million; 
<br/>2020 - $160 million; and  
<br/>2021 - $250 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bank’s current average lending rate and cost of borrowing as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2021 are 
<br/></span><span>5.84 per cent and 2.16 per cent respectively.  Additionally, the Bank also accommodates and delivers

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a variety of the Fijian Government socio-economic and lending policies and, therefore, requests that 
<br/>it continues to be assisted by the provision of the Fijian Government guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, what are the implications for Government?  As at 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 
<br/>2021, the total Government guaranteed debt overall stood at $1.1 billion or 10.8 per cent of GDP.  
<br/>Accessing the $200 million guarantee will increase the total Government guarantee ex posure to $1.3 
<br/>billion or 12.7 per cent of GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the event of a default by the Bank, which it has not done, the Fijian Government will be 
<br/>liable  for  the  guaranteed  borrowings  of  the  Bank.    The  Bank  has  never  had  to  call  on  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government guarantee, as mentioned, to honour its guarantee and the guarantee fee continues to be 
<br/>paid out promptly upon the utilisation of the guarantees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to also take an opportunity to commend the Bank and the staff 
<br/>in particular in the COVID-19 Recovery Credit Guarantee Scheme, a success. Despite the country 
<br/>battling the second wave of COVID-19, staff worked either remotely or reported to the office and 
<br/>their commitment also made them, in fact, the largest lender of funds under this particular facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the following provide the summary of the Bank’s achievement in the first 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>six months as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2021of the Bank’s 2022 financial year:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bank achieved 96.23 per cent of its projected net total income.  
<br/>The Bank’s total loan portfolio stood at $658.1 million, recording a growth of 6.34 per cent 
<br/>by value in comparison to the end of the financial year, 2021. 
<br/>The number of customers has increased from 8,533 when compared to 4,590 customers in 
<br/>June 2021, so it has grown by 85 per cent in numbers the customer base. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of approximately $93.6 million has been disbursed in loans and this includes around 
<br/>$60 million disbursed under the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme.  Total applications received 
<br/>was  14,650  valued  at  $253.7  million  and  99  per  cent  applications,  interestingly,  was  received 
<br/>digitally.  Total applications approved out of the 14,000 was 4,498, valued at $59.6 million and all 
<br/>the funds were disbursed digitally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total  applications  declined  was  10,152  which  was  69  per  cent  of  the  total  applications 
<br/>received  and  valued  at  $194.1  million.    Existing  FDB  customers  stood  at  $15.7  million.  New 
<br/>customers to FDB was $43.9 million.  So, the new customers of $43.9 million were completely new 
<br/></span><span>to FDB, they saw FDB as an alternative to meeting their financial requirements and of course took 
<br/></span><span>advantage of the fact that FDB has been extremely efficient in the delivery of this service and indeed 
<br/>very expeditious in their responses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  90  per  cent  of  loans  approved  was  towards  the  MSMEs,  loans  of  up  to 
<br/>$20,000, valued at $36.4 million.  SIR, 10 per cent of loans approved were towards the large and 
<br/>medium enterprises which are loans of up to $100,000 valued at $23.2 million.  The Bank, of course, 
<br/>has this new project and vision which is getting closer to the customers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The full digitisation of the COVID-19 scheme application process actually changed the way 
<br/>the Bank operated. Before it was very paper-heavy, now it is very little, meaning little paper is used.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  launch  of  the  Rice  Mobility  Package,  loan  applications  on  fully  digital  platform. 
<br/>Partnership  with  Vodafone  and  Digicel,  as  mentioned  yesterday,  the  distributions  were  through 
<br/>MPAiSA and MyCash.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FDB has now commenced providing e-bank

<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>509 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statements from January 2022, so this helps customers to be actually aware of the total exposure to 
<br/>the Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the introductory comments I would like to make in respect of this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  side  of  the  House  does  not  agree  to  the 
<br/>motion.  Let me start by saying this.  It is a very serious matter to consider that, given the desperate 
<br/>situation that Fiji is in now, almost at neck level in relation to debts and liabilities, and here were are 
<br/>being asked, again, to agree to another $200 million guarantee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Guarantee, not loan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- I know. It is a guarantee. It is a commitment. It is a contingent 
<br/>liability.  He does not do accounting. He does not finish his professorship.  So, it is a very, very big 
<br/>undertaking to push us further into the deep and that being said, Mr. Speaker, already we have $7.1 
<br/>billion in debt level, $5 million of those directly the responsibility of FijiFirst Government. They 
<br/>started with $2.5 million and they added another $5 million to that and as stated by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Acting Prime Minister guarantee is $1.1 billion. Now they are here to ask us again to add on to that 
<br/></span><span>with the $200 million.  So, it is a very serious undertaking. They are asking the people of Fiji under 
<br/>this motion to commit themselves too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, having said that you know this side of the House, we are seriously concerned at 
<br/>the manner in which this motion has found itself into the House.  It is almost here without notice.  It 
<br/>is a very, very big undertaking and we need information as I said to make a mature judgement. So, 
<br/>we are primarily concern in the manner that they have now abuse, I can say they abuse this House 
<br/>by bringing this motion here without notice and without the necessary information for us to make a 
<br/>mature judgement and we are entitled to ask questions. We are suspicious, you know it begs so many 
<br/>questions. In my view and he can reply to that this is being done to finance the election campaign, to 
<br/>buy votes through FDB, MSMEs and agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, to the public expect some handouts and even you know the situation they are giving cash 
<br/>handout.  How do you acquit cash? So, I am telling the public up there, receive it, take this money 
<br/>but do not vote for them.  Having said that let me just remind them, what have you done to grow the 
<br/>economy.  They have not done anything to grow the economy but now they are doing this so voters 
<br/>out there, receive whatever handouts that comes from the Government but do not vote FijiFirst. So, 
<br/></span><span>coming back to this, Mr. Speaker, there are two things, to me it is an abuse of process, abuse of this 
<br/></span><span>House to be bringing in this motion and the second point is that we simply do not afford. We cannot 
<br/>afford to guarantee this money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we understand section 16 (1) of the Fiji Development Bank (Act) allows them 
<br/>to come here and ask for guarantee. We also know that Section 145 of the Constitution entitles them 
<br/>to come here and supply to us information.  Section 145 says there are four things that they could do 
<br/>instead  of  coming  directly  here  to  ask  us  to  approve.    What  they  could  have  done  is  to  ask  for 
<br/>information  and  then  make  recommendation  to  this  House  on  things  like  the  extent  of  the  total 
<br/>indebtedness, the use to be made in relation to the loan and the purpose of guarantee and repayment. 
<br/>And  the  right  thing  to  do  considering  that  is  for  the  Government  to  seek  advice  from  chartered 
<br/>accountants so that we can make an objective assessment and bring it here. We are entitled to do that 
<br/>but they are not doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General has spent about 15 minutes trying to justify and convince 
<br/>us to vote for this.  We do not need that. We need professional advice. Section 145 allows them to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do that, so in his right of reply can we ask him to answer to us, why is he not utilising that because 
<br/>that allows for transparency, that allows for mature judgment, that allows for us to make a decision 
<br/>in relation to a very big undertaking as this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may go now to the affordability of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated that we simply 
<br/>cannot afford to be guaranteeing any further sum other than what we have done already and I have 
<br/>stated that the debt level of the Government is simply too much.  Within the year, we had a total loan 
<br/>of $720 million, nearly $1 billion and that is made up of the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$200 million to refinance global bond; 
<br/>Another $220 million from ADB; 
<br/>Another $50 million from ADB; 
<br/>$40 million from International Development Association (IDA); 
<br/>$145 million from IDA and IBRD; and 
<br/>$55 million from JICA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Only in this year $720 million in debt and that is nearly $1 billion and as already stated by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Attorney-General add to that $1.1 billion in guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We simply cannot afford and we ask him to answer to us whether we are in a position we can 
<br/>afford to be doing this and not only that Mr. Speaker, if you look at the situation with FDB and I am 
<br/>holding here which I am sure he has too, the Fijian Government Annual Debt Report and I think it is 
<br/>stated there that a guarantee to FDB is considered as a high risk.  So, let us also demand from him an 
<br/>explanation whether that is correct or not.  The honourable Minister for Agriculture is asking me, 
<br/>what you mean high risk.  Well let me read this to him …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No, you said I think.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- If you go to page four under the heading Risk Profiles of Publicly 
<br/>Guaranteed Liabilities then you have a section there of Tier Low, Medium and High.  Tier 3 is High 
<br/>and FDB is listed under three and the explanation that is given for that why it is considered as high 
<br/>risk is as follows and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The aviation and travel industry together with general administration sectors have 
<br/>been  the  hardest  hit  during  the  pandemic.    FDB  and  Housing  Authority  have  been 
<br/>providing loan repayment holidays to their affected customers and are undertaking loan 
<br/>provisions to account for the increased likelihood of  payment defaults due to COVID-19 
<br/>crisis.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, let the honourable Attorney-General  answer us also  in  relation to  that,  whether that is 
<br/>correct or FDB is not considered as a risk institution to be giving a guarantee to. So, basically and 
<br/>then  Mr.  Speaker,  and  this  is  not  the  first  time,  so  we  have  to  ask  the  Government  why?    Why 
<br/>continuing to guarantee?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FDB has been here before even during this term or session of Parliament and they were 
<br/></span><span>here previously in 2019 on 14</span><span>th</span><span> February we had a similar motion on this, same thing.  Same points 
<br/></span><span>that he has raised now was stated there at that time and also further to that, even last year we can 
<br/>consider that because it was during COVID-19 pandemic but taking all into account, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, FDB has been coming to this House and asking for guarantee, after guarantee after guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017, it came here for approval of $190.6 million.  In 2018 - $200 million, in 2019 - $291.9 
<br/></span><span>million, in 2020 - $307.8 million, in 2021 - $308.8 million and now $200 million.  We have to ask

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ourselves, why?  We cannot be doing this, they are expected to look after their own and the worrying 
<br/>thing now is that, we fear.  This may also be an avenue for Government to finance Fiji Airways, so 
<br/>we are entitled to ask these questions because of the nature that they have brought this in, the process 
<br/>they have brought this motion in and the lack of information.  For those reasons, we cannot support 
<br/>this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I speak on the motion, I wanted to 
<br/>respond to the Acting Prime Minister’s defence on the attack on two respected journalists, Anish 
<br/>Chand and Vijay Narayan yesterday.  In his defence, he challenged them to declare which side of 
<br/>politics they support or individuals or a political party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  I  did  not  challenge  anyone.    The  challenge  is  going 
<br/>between other people amongst your side.  What I did say, is that if a particular media organisation 
<br/>has a particular political proclivity (and they have the right to do that) they should declare that.  That 
<br/></span><span>is what I said and I did give an example, so I did say that the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> has and wants to support 
<br/></span><span>Rabuka and NFP, there is nothing wrong with that.  All they have to do is state in the Editorial, “we 
<br/>actually support Rabuka and NFP policies” and whatever it is, like other good media organisations 
<br/>do so.  Do not hide behind the facade of being independent.  This is very simple.  The honourable 
<br/>Member is now going on about it because I hit a wrong nerve, that is the problem; that is what it is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I accept that but let me ask him the same 
<br/>question, whether he can say the same to FBC and </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> and in particular FBC, funded by the 
<br/>taxpayers, </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> partly funded by the taxpayers through exclusive advertising and if you look at 
<br/>the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> and </span><span>Fijivillage</span><span>, there is more government news, more coverage of what these guys say 
<br/>from  the  other  side  than  you  will  ever  see  in  FBC  or  </span><span>Fiji  Sun</span><span>  and  all  you  see  is  attack  on  the 
<br/>Opposition.  In fact, I would say that FBC and </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> should declare whether they have this political 
<br/>affiliation with the FijiFirst Party and with the Acting Prime Minister and others in the Party.  He 
<br/>should be honest and say that, Mr. Speaker, and I challenge them too to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just before you carry on, we are going to go round 
<br/>and round and round about newspapers about radio programmes supporting one side or the other.  It 
<br/>will never end, let me tell you that.  Tell this side of the House and that side of the House, it will keep 
<br/></span><span>on going. We have got an important agenda item to discuss here, so stick to the agenda item. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was an important point I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have made it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well, you tell yourself Acting Prime Minister.  Respect the 
<br/>Speaker, he just made a ruling.  You always tell us to respect the Speaker, you respect the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me begin by endorsing what honourable Nawaikula said, the process.  All the figures that 
<br/>the Acting Prime Minister was giving, I could not hear all of them and these are important figures 
<br/>from 2021 that we do not have in any publication.  He is bringing it in a motion and giving us all 
<br/>those statistics which we do not have. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A good and transparent government what they would have done, with the motion, with an 
<br/>appropriate notice provided us with all those statistics and data for 2021.  The points we are making 
<br/>and then he will turn around and said “oh, your figures are wrong” this is what they do because we 
<br/>do not have access to those kind of figures.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, is this guarantee really 
<br/>to  uplift  the  economy  and  help  the  ordinary  people,  especially  the  agricultural  sector  and  small 
<br/>businesses? That is the first question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the 2019 FDB Annual Report as I said yesterday or the day before 
<br/>yesterday, a different picture of what we are being told.  Let me just quote some of the 2019 figures 
<br/>and try and relate that to what the honourable Acting Prime Minister gave.  In 2019 the bank approved 
<br/>a total of 1,595 loans, valued at $187.5 million, of this 1,313 loans valued at $87.48 million were 
<br/>approved in the focus sector. This reflects 82.32 per cent of loan approvals in number but was only 
<br/>46.63 per cent in value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were 282 loans approved in the non-focus sector, valued at $100.11 
<br/>million. This reflects 17.68 per cent of loan approvals in number but 53.37 per cent in value.  If I 
<br/>heard the honourable Acting Prime Minister correctly, in 2021 the non-focus sector value stands at 
<br/>54.2 per cent.  So, is $87 million focus sector more than two years ago?  The majority market share 
<br/></span><span>of agriculture loans that we are asked to believe.  Because if it was, FDB would still be operating 
<br/></span><span>branches in other areas, small municipality, mostly linked to the agriculture sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>as well as to the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2021 Parliament approved $250 million in guarantees to FDB for one 
<br/>year until the end of this month.  The first was the guarantee of $170 million on 26th May and the 
<br/>second was a further $80 million on 22nd October, 2021.  A day dedicated to the election of the new 
<br/>President.  You know, you remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We approved two further guarantees to FDB 
<br/>and Fiji Airways respectively and both, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were additional guarantees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this motion means that FDB will be guaranteed $450 million and I think the 
<br/>honourable Minister quoted $340.42 million.  So, we have to check the correct one - for two years 
<br/>from February 2021 to February 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  motion  itself,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  is  also  unclear  as  I  said  before,  if  we  had  all  these 
<br/>information that we just heard, we would be in a better position to make the assessment.  He listed 
<br/>the sectors that it is going and my question is, some of the guarantee, is it also going to entities like 
<br/>Fiji Airways?  Was $20 million from last October’s guarantee of $80 million used to lend to Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Airways.  How much of last year’s guarantee has been utilised and what it is break down of loan 
<br/></span><span>portfolio? I think we heard some of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Nawaikula pointed out, I mean contingent liabilities, okay FDB may not have 
<br/>called on its guarantees but we have had situations here where the Government had to and when we 
<br/>look at our total debt situation and we look at $1.3 billion contingent liabilities now, it is an important 
<br/>point, important concern and honourable Nawaikula was right in raising that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other question we want to ask is what is the portfolio of bad loans held by the Bank?  For 
<br/>example,  we  were  told  by  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister  yesterday  or  on  Monday  that 
<br/>Pulllman Resort which was built on borrowed funds from FDB and HFC has been sold after being 
<br/>mortgaged.  So, I want to ask the honourable Minister for Economy to reveal what is the sale price?  
<br/>Is it $56 million?  What is the total debt owed to FDB?   Further, has the sale amount been settled in 
<br/>full or not?  If not, why not?  Because we are informed that initially a 10 per cent deposit was provided 
<br/>and the buyer is making settlement through partial payments. Who is the buyer?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, the news media reported it was some Jay Nand Singh from the United States of 
<br/>America.  We want to know whether he is the same person who is Fiji’s Honorary Consulate to San 
<br/>Francisco for the last six years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier I asked about bad loan portfolio for transparency.  Our perusal of 
<br/>FDB Annual Reports revealed one interesting defaulter.  It is a firm called Vuksich &amp; Borich, a New 
<br/>Zealand based firm engaged by the Government for Momi Bay development by the Bainimarama 
<br/>Government.    On  18</span><span>th</span><span>  June,  2010,  the  Momi  Bay  Development  Decree  was  enacted  for  the 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Act, get it right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You unilaterally made it an Act.  At that time it was a Decree.  
<br/>I am talking about 2010.  You cannot get a simple point, at that time it was a Decree, now it is an 
<br/>Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Parliament passed it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  shudder  to  think  that  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Attorney-General cannot understand a simple point, I am talking about 2010, at that time it was a 
<br/>Decree.  It was done by a Decree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The honourable Member is trying to create a ruckus.  He 
<br/>knows that this very Parliament in the last session of Parliament when he was an MP, we passed the 
<br/>law that says, Decrees are referred to, irrespective, whether it was done by Rabuka’s VAT Decree, 
<br/>whatever, it is now called an Act of Parliament.  So he needs to refer to it as an Act.  He is only doing 
<br/>it deliberately.  This is the kind of mischievous man he is.  Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Acting Prime Minister 
<br/>is losing it.  All I said that it was done in 2010 by a Decree, it may be an Act now.  So, what is the 
<br/>big problem there?  A deed was signed by all parties at that time, developer, contractor, government 
<br/>and FDB.  What concerns us is that, until now the loan given to the firm has not been paid.  I am told 
<br/></span><span>it is over $33 million.  Incredibly the loan was granted by the then government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project has been completed a long time ago, but we found out FDB’s request for payment 
<br/>is being ignored by the Government.  If that is the case, why is the Government not paying FDB?  
<br/>Why are they forcing them to borrow through these guarantees?  The question is, if Government is 
<br/>not honouring its commitment of $33 million guarantee, how is it expected to honour guarantees to 
<br/>hundreds of millions of dollars in contingent liabilities to the Bank?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Nawaikula said, we should expect a very tough time in the next two or three 
<br/>years, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We keep hearing that we had unprecedented growth in the last seven years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Nine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Unprecedented growth.  When the average growth from 2010 
<br/>to 2020 was just 3.3 per cent, a modest growth, and he could not pay $33 million during that boom.  
<br/>These are the questions….

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Get your facts right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well, give the facts, that is what I am telling you.  When they 
<br/>bring these kinds of motions, it would have been nice if they produced together with the motion all 
<br/>the statistics, all the data and what is happening.  We do not want to know the details of the contract, 
<br/>but we want to know whether it has been paid, and if not, then why.  These are the questions that 
<br/>need  honest  and  straight  answers,  and  not  the  kind  of  drama  that  we  see  sometimes  from  the 
<br/>honourable Minister with his point of orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I kind of agree with honourable Nawaikula.  This is a Government, if you look 
<br/>at  their  track  record,  the  interim  Government  or  the  Bainimarama  Government  before  the  2014 
<br/>Election and what they did before 2018 Election, they went on and spending spree, they used FDB 
<br/>and other organisations to put out these handouts just before the Election, to convince the people. In 
<br/>fact, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you a little story.  Two weeks before the Election, I went to my village 
<br/>and had a meeting.   Then a week-and-a-half later, I heard that honourable Koya was there and this 
<br/>was during Election campaign and about 200 people around that area got  $1,000 each.  This was 
<br/>before the Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have seen as the effect of that, Mr. Speaker, is that spending is free, that they went 
<br/></span><span>on in 2017 and 2018 through borrowing and through this kind of guarantees, and then what we saw 
<br/>in 2019, the ADB Report talks about it that because of reduced public spending, our economy actually 
<br/>contracted.  It did not grow but actually contracted, because of what they did and it was simply to 
<br/>win Election and to fool the people of this country.   But let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, people may be 
<br/>gullible but people are not fools.  People are not stupid.  They actually understand now what this 
<br/>Government was all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Nawaikula said, people actually know.  People are telling us that this time, 
<br/>this Government is not going to buy their votes through handouts. They are telling us, and I am sure 
<br/>they are telling them too as well and they know that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that Government has come up with this without having a clear 
<br/>idea and a clear understanding of where the flash points are in the economy, where are the constraints, 
<br/>where they need to intervene, where the funding ought to go, and all they are trying to do is repeat 
<br/>the same trick in an election year that they undertook in 2018.  The same trick!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You can see they attack on Mr. Rabuka, they also attack me.  The same old trick, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>coupled with this idea of “we are looking after the people” and the promise that they will keep doing 
<br/></span><span>this.  As I have said, every government wants to win the next election, that is understandable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Every party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Every  party,  that  is  understood,  but  in  a  democracy,  the 
<br/>governing party must always think, Mr. Speaker.  As I have said yesterday, some of the good things 
<br/>that they have done, if they want to leave a legacy, they must ensure that they do the right thing by 
<br/>the Opposition too. That is what they should do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Heath is saying, “You will never have a legacy”, but this man is 
<br/>going to leave the worst legacy ever in the health system of the country. All the Ministers that I have 
<br/>seen, starting from honourable Akbar and the others, he is a medical doctor but the worst Minister 
<br/>for Health in the history of this country.  He lied about angiogram, he lied about the medicine and he 
<br/>is saying, “No, we are not going to leave our legacy.”  I mean, this is the kind of comment we are 
<br/>getting.  But, anyway, I will leave that for another day, Mr. Speaker.  Let me come back to the point.

<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just stick to what is been debated.  Do not go around

<div><span>all over the place. You are doing alright. What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a very clear motion in 
<br/>the House to be debated and I think we are getting this new disease that is now prevalent in the House 
<br/>where people are losing their marbles.  Let us focus on this motion, let us not go here, it is not yet 
<br/>election time.  We are not talking about elections, let us focus on this motion, let us get on with it.  
<br/>We have got a long agenda today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad he did not go to Rwanda and Solomon Islands, but let 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me come back to the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  This kind of motions, guarantee by Parliament, is not a small thing.  It is not a joke.  It is a 
<br/></span><span>serious issue.  I would give them this advice.  In the future, when you bring a motion for a guarantee, 
<br/>please, do a two-pager of the details and the statistics up to that point so that we, in Parliament, can 
<br/>have a very clear view of where the Government is coming from.  That is what we are asking.  We 
<br/>will understand their motivation and the reason why they want to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  without  all  these  good  principles  of  accountability  and  transparency  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information, it is very difficult to support this kind of motion.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank (FDB) Guarantee.  Honourable Members from this side of the House had raised 
<br/>pertinent  issues  regarding  this,  in  particular  there  have  been  issues  raised  about  FDB  loans,  the 
<br/>portfolios and maybe bad or good loans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue regarding Pullman, that is public knowledge regarding the new buyer.  That was 
<br/>reported in the media on 17</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2021.  The new owner is Paradigm Group of Companies 
<br/>Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ganendra Mangal Singh, also known as Jay Singh.  He sealed the deal 
<br/>in  October,  a  close  source  confirmed.    This  is  a  major  boost  for  tourism  and  there  are  some 
<br/></span><span>background on him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  was  recognised  by  the  United  States  Government  as  Fiji’s  Honorary  Consul  in  San 
<br/>Francisco in 2015.  He was born in Fiji and migrated to the United States. He has built a real estate 
<br/>portfolio, he had a humble beginnings, et cetera.  So, that was what that was reported in the media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had queried yesterday and also by honourable Professor Prasad, as to what extent of the 
<br/>debt  has  been  repaid  which  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB)  and  Home  Finance  Company  had 
<br/>provided?  So, that is an information which, we on this side of the House, would have liked to be 
<br/>provided with today.  I had raised our concerns regarding the lack of information prior to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government Guarantees in general, we note are usually taken by lenders to mobilise and 
<br/>leverage  commercial  financing  by  mitigating  risks,  and  that  is  understood.    It  does  not  require  a 
<br/>guarantor to pay any cash outflow and it is contingent liabilities.  The fact that lenders can still accept 
<br/>a guarantee from the Fiji Government shows that they have assessed their own risk assessment and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that Fiji Government is a credible guarantor and is able to service the loan, in the event of default by 
<br/>the customer.  That is the understanding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Guarantee given by the Government for the purposes of FDB would be beneficial to the 
<br/>extent that the capital raised by FDB through the various means mentioned are invested in activities 
<br/>that stimulate growth in the economy, and ensure that it continues to service the focussed sectors 
<br/>more than the non-focussed as already raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also pointed that out yesterday in the FDB Annual Report which we had highlighted that the 
<br/>focussed sector accounts comprise nearly 80 per cent of FDB portfolio but 43.35 per cent in value.  
<br/>While the non-focussed, 20.45 per cent of portfolio but 56.65 per cent in value.  Again, that is from 
<br/>2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General had shared with us today the updated information up to 
<br/>2021 and we register our concern regarding this issue.  If we look at Standing Order 131- Government 
<br/>guarantees  and  loans,  there  are  some  directions  there  on  Government  guarantees  and  loans.  The 
<br/>Government must provide necessary information to show the extent of the total indebtedness of the 
<br/>Government by way of principal and accumulated interest. In SO 121(2)(b), it states, “the use made 
<br/></span><span>or to be made of the proceeds”,  he has explained that.  In part (c), “if a loan, the provisions made for 
<br/></span><span>servicing  or  repayment  of  the  loan  and  the  progress  made  in  the  repayment  of  it”,  from  my 
<br/>perspective, Sir, this part has not been provided. So, whether this is a valid motion regarding that 
<br/>Standard Order is questionable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is not a loan, guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that comes under guarantees and loans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It says, “if a loan…”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That is why we are raising our concern regarding that particular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue on the lack of information and the need for us to properly assess the Motion in front of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Nawaikula had raised some pertinent issues regarding contingent liabilities. In 
<br/>the Fijian Government Annual Debt Report 2021, that is clearly explained there. He has mentioned 
<br/>the risk assessment and, again, we repeat that FDB is listed there as high risk, together with other 
<br/>organisations such as Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  issue  I  would  like  to  emphasise  from  that  Annual  Debt  Report,  Sir,  is  under  that 
<br/>contingent  liabilities  table  that  is  on  the  Appendix,  the  amount  of  contingent  liabilities  and  the 
<br/>guarantees which we had provided for the various organisations.  For FDB, that had been increasing 
<br/>since 2017 up to now.  So, 190.6 up to last year - 308 and now, we are looking at the amount in front 
<br/>of us which is 200.  In the last few years, it amounts to about $1.3 billion. That is the question we are 
<br/>raising today and not only that, but also the viability of such guarantees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also note, if you look at the FDB finances, the net profit from 2010 was $2.36 million, then 
<br/>2011 and it increased in 2013 - $4.13 million, 2014 - $4.89 million, 2015 - $6.14 million, 2016 - 
<br/>$7.31 million, 2017 - $8.51 million and then started deteriorating from there.  From 2018, 2019 and 
<br/>2020,  it  was  $1.14  million.  The  latest  figures  have  been  provided  by  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General, according to those lines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate that we would like to see more details, not only the past guarantors and how that 
<br/>had been utilised - the FDB bank loans, non-performing portfolios and in particular, more details on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>517 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the utilisation of the past guarantors and SME loans which have been emphasised today as the main 
<br/>component to be utilised for this particular guarantor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  issue  which  we  had  raised  on  the  current  economic  situation,  again,  that  is  clearly 
<br/>specified. We note the huge debt, I suppose, uncontrollable debt situation and this, again, is clearly 
<br/>articulated in the ADB Report.  Let me share some of those in terms of Fiji’s per capita income that 
<br/>has deteriorated from 2016 - $5,280, 2017 - $53,030, from there 2019 - $5,800, 2020 - $4,720 and 
<br/>2021 projection - $4,492.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other issues raised, there is emphasis on the progress in fiscal management but Fiji’s debt 
<br/>sustainability has deteriorated since 2015.  Fiji’s fiscal buffers are limited because of its economic 
<br/>size, Fiji’s gross domestic saving is low averaging 20.7 per cent of GDP during 2014 – 2018.  Again, 
<br/>that was emphasised yesterday by honourable Prasad and below the savings of that group of nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is one of the few countries with domestic capital market but net portfolio invested average 
<br/>is only 0.6 per cent of GDP during 2019.  I have mentioned the debt sustainability.  There are other 
<br/>issues  there  in  terms  of  FDI,  we  discussed  that  yesterday.    Overall,  what  we  are  emphasising  is 
<br/>Government prudence in spending and we have not heard today regarding this overall debt situation 
<br/></span><span>and Government income and expenditure on how Government will control its expenditure in terms 
<br/></span><span>of the limited deteriorating income it has been receiving. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  again,  is  an  issue  which  the  honourable  Attorney-General  probably  in  his  reply  will 
<br/>touch particularly on that in terms of controlling Government expenditure in the next 12 months I 
<br/>suppose because the election is coming up and it is very highly likely based on the service which 
<br/>have been done, they will not be here.  Who will answer for the economic mess that we are in?  That 
<br/>is the fundamental question because it looks like that we in the Opposition will be picking up the 
<br/>mess, we will be fixing the broken pieces of what they have created, not only the debt but all sorts of 
<br/>other issues in terms of governance, good governance et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sad thing about this is they are the architects of their own demise.  Why?  It is because 
<br/>they created the 2013 Constitution in terms of election methodology to have one star but now it is 
<br/>biting them back.  They do not have one star who will be able to gain 100,000 votes or more and 
<br/>which one of them will get that because as I see it, none of them will get that and they will not be 
<br/>here to answer for this mess.  They need someone who will get 100,000 votes but they cannot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, our concern is this mismanagement of our economy which will be handled by us, that is 
<br/></span><span>why  we  are  raising  our  concern.    We  will  need  to  deal  with  the  debt  situation  because  by  all 
<br/></span><span>indications based on the polling which has been done by independent sources none of them will get 
<br/>100,000 votes and they will be all going out and please in your last few months, just try to do some 
<br/>cost cutting measures of the expenditure, so that you can assist us when we come in, we come in at 
<br/>least with some solid foundation there.  We are coming and taking over the Government but now all 
<br/>indications are that when we come in, everything will be broken in pieces which we will have to fix.  
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,    Sir,  as  indicated  by  my  colleagues  we  are  very 
<br/>concerned  with  the  way  it  was  brought  into  Parliament.    We  have  always  supported  the  Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank but we want it to be done properly and because of that we will not be supporting 
<br/>this motion.  As honourable Professor Prasad has said you could have given us an overview of what 
<br/>is to be presented today, a couple of days ago to enable us to study this thing but as always it came 
<br/>yesterday afternoon and here we are trying to debate something of this magnitude.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my concern with FDB is the mix between the focus segment and the non-
<br/>focus segment.  As indicated by the honourable Ro Tuisawau even though the number of loans are 
<br/>higher on the focus group, the quantum is high on the non-focus segment.  This is what our team 
<br/>have indicated to us on one of the points, how can the Government satisfy itself to ensure that there 
<br/>will not be many bad loans issued by the Bank that the Bank cannot recover these loans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, when a big borrower falls, Mr. Speaker, that is frightening for the institution.  We were 
<br/>told over the last few days that Pullman has managed to secure a buyer, so what it means is that for 
<br/>some time the Pullman Resort loan was not performing.  It would have been frozen, normally in the 
<br/>banks it is called the non-performing loans and you freeze the interest on those loans, so it would be 
<br/>useful to know how much interest was not collected on the loan to Pullman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FDB is a small bank relative to the other banks in Fiji, the lenders in Fiji.  It is 
<br/>always wise for FDB to try and be part of a syndicate in the way they lend.  That way if there is three 
<br/>or four lenders, the risk is reduced.  I notice with Pullman the syndicate was between FDB and HFC.  
<br/>Both of these are local banks, so it is frightening for these two local banks to be exposed to the kind 
<br/>of loan that the Pullman required.  If Pullman had failed, Mr. Speaker, the write-off could have been 
<br/>huge for FDB and it could have cost the Bank, it could have even affected the viability or the future 
<br/></span><span>of the Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  say  this,  Mr.  Speaker  because  I  had  years  with  City  Bank  of  New  York,  they  had  an 
<br/>operation in Fiji and we lent to what is today the Warwick.  Remember in those days it was called 
<br/>Noah Coral Gardens.  That was before the days of RBF, it used to be Central Monetary Authority of 
<br/>Fiji (CMA) and they allowed us to borrow from Singapore and lend locally.  It used to be called the 
<br/>Singapore Dawn at that time, you may remember that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There came a time when 
<br/>the  company  that  was  building  Noah  Coral  Gardens  collapsed  in  Australia.    This  was  during  the 
<br/>1970s, the implosion at that time.  And so you remember the hotel just sat there, half-finished and 
<br/>the bank lost a lot of money but this is City Bank of New York, it was able to wear that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eventually the Hyatt came in, they had a buyer. Was it Gordon Oliver?  He was able to put 
<br/>together a consortium of buyers and then Hyatt became the Hyatt and now it is the Warwick.  What 
<br/>I am saying here is that City Bank could wear it at that time because of its size.  I am worried about 
<br/>the FDB wearing a failure of that magnitude.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, I would always caution FDB 
<br/>whenever it lends to projects like this that it must do so in a syndicated manner.  Get others to be part 
<br/>of it.  As I said, it is good that HFC was part of it so they could share the risk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On HFC, Mr. Speaker, some years ago I raised the question about Vatulele Island Resort.  I 
<br/></span><span>was not allowed to bring it up as a question in the House, I was told that it was a private matter but 
<br/>then Vatulele was also dormant for quite some time.  When a resort is dormant, you can imagine 
<br/>what is happening with the loan.  And all these years, I am now happy that Vatulele has found a 
<br/>buyer but again, was it a local institution that lent money to Vatulele.  That is my concern because if 
<br/>it is HFC, it is a local bank, so, Mr. Speaker, I would prevail upon FDB that when it lends to the non-
<br/>focus sector, it must do so in a syndicated manner because the size of the lending is huge and I know 
<br/>there are some big projects that have borrowed from FDB.  So, Mr. Speaker, I would use that as a 
<br/>caution and if the Bank can take note of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But going forward, Mr. Speaker, on the focus sector - agriculture.  On a development basis, 
<br/>what is the Bank doing about developing the cassava industry, cassava association?  Two years ago, 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Agriculture told us that there is a market for a special kind of cassava 
<br/>that was in demand in Australia to the tune of $38 million a month.  He told us the demand for this 
<br/>special kind of cassava was by the fast food chains and they would make chips out of it and currently 
<br/>they are importing the cassava from Puerto Rico into Australia.  He told us that Fiji had this potential 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>519 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to grow this kind of cassava and export to Australia.  It may have been $34 million or $38 million 
<br/>but  he  gave  us  a  figure  that  was  quite  significant  at  the  time  and  very  promising.    So,  I  ask  the 
<br/>question, where is it today?  Why could not FDB lend money into something like that which would 
<br/>be something of a truly developmental nature? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, today I had a conference with the Fiji Cassava Association.  FDB should look 
<br/>into funding the setting up of the Fiji cassava Association.  It is a new export crop.  We are supporting 
<br/>the sugar industry, I think when it comes to about development, and FDB must look into the Fiji 
<br/>Cassava Association.  That, of course, Mr. Speaker, is on the focus group and that should be the role 
<br/>of the FDB.  And I would like to ask the honourable Minister, what happened to that promise you 
<br/>gave us two years ago, that there is a new market for cassava.  He is a very persuasive speaker, you 
<br/>know he is an economist, he comes up with all these wonderful figures.  I was sitting here and said 
<br/>wow. This is what we have been waiting for but we have been waiting for two years.  Where is it 
<br/>honourable Minister please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And just before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, I was in Naqali in Naitasiri and they said to me,</span><span>
<br/>Naita</span><span>, still in Nadroga - </span><span>Naita. </span><span>Can you ask the Minister?  He told us not to use paraquat anymore 
<br/>but what he gave us is useless compared to paraquat.  He said we prefer paraquat.  I said look, I know 
<br/></span><span>there is a chemical things here but they said what he gave us to replace paraquat is totally useless.  
<br/></span><span>We are talking about FDB and agriculture, can I ask the honourable Minister to get his act together 
<br/>and go visit the people of Naqali. Again, they have just gone through this flood thing, go and see 
<br/>them, and let them show you that what you sent to replace paraquat, is totally useless.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have made my point there, the difference between the focussed 
<br/>segment of the Bank and the non-focussed, and that we must be careful on what we lend on a scale 
<br/>like  we  did  in  Pullman and  I  think  there  are  other  projects  in  here  that  can  only  be  mitigated  by 
<br/>syndication.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is before the House.  I think I have been quiet for the last two days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the motion that is before the House, I would support a similar motion that was in the Fiji 
<br/>Airways motion.  I think the public perception was that money is given by Government to those who 
<br/>are seeking guarantees but there is a big difference between guarantee and a loan.  In this one, there 
<br/>is no direct funding that is given it is just an assurance by the Government to the financial institution. 
<br/>So, in a guarantee situation, it helps to reduce the funding cost of banks thus curbing the panic through 
<br/></span><span>the financial markets and system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That has a trickle-down effect too on the interest rates of the banks.  Here I stand as a farmer 
<br/>and also a person who really lives in Macuata with Fiji Development Bank having its banks in Labasa, 
<br/>Savusavu, Nabouwalu, Taveuni and also in Seaqaqa. These are all farming communities with cane 
<br/>farmers and also</span><span> dalo</span><span> and </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farmers, those that invest in logging and all in Fiji Pine; all these 
<br/>are mostly indigenous entrepreneurs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you talk about Macuata and Bua Pine Owners Group they do pine cutting.  Most of the 
<br/>y</span><span>avusa</span><span> and </span><span>mataqali</span><span> own trucks through loans with Fiji Development Bank.  Through loans with 
<br/>Fiji Development Bank, they are able to secure tenders through Fiji Pine when they do cutting of 
<br/>pine from Seaqaqa to the Wairiki Wharf.  These are some of the business that run in the rural areas 
<br/>that depend on the Fiji Development Bank loans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also on the SMEs, let me talk about the Northern Development Programme. Most of those 
<br/>who are participants in the Northern Development Programmes are also clients of Fiji Development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bank; majority of them.  We talk about fishermen, parcel sellers, market vendors and all other SMEs 
<br/>in the rural areas that help in the economic spin, they are clients of Fiji Development Bank. They 
<br/>normally secure this kind of loans through FDB where no other commercial institution will accept 
<br/>these applications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Development Bank is naturally tailored for those in the rural areas who want to venture 
<br/>into business. We talk about the Northern economy and how it is developed. The big clients of Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank in Labasa. We talked about Valebasoga Tropik Board, Vunimoli Sawmillers; the 
<br/>big contractors, Bula Earthworks and other Fiji Roads Authoirty subcontractors who do big projects 
<br/>in  Vanua  Levu  and all hardware companies who do frequent  engagements with  the rebuilding of 
<br/>schools and homes of those in the rural areas.  They are all clients of Fiji Development Bank.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On another smaller scale, if you go do down to the villages, most villagers, you talk about 
<br/>loans for trucks, trucks that transport children to school through LTA – RSL. Most of those trucks 
<br/>that are owned by </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or a group in a village are by way of Fiji Development Bank loan. So 
<br/>when  we  look  at  this  guarantee  in  a  holistic  manner,  the  role  that  this  bank  plays  which  is  very 
<br/>important in the development of our community and how economy grows in the rural area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we talk about climate change through green financing and how those projects that FDB 
<br/></span><span>has accredited to get all these investors so that they can partner through FDB in the various mitigating 
<br/>and adaptation projects in the rural community.  We talk about bad roads and other effects of climate 
<br/>change but we need climate resilient projects through the funding that is available at FDB and the 
<br/>accreditation.  That is why there needs to be Members of Parliament as leaders who support these 
<br/>kinds of guarantees because it supports an enabling institution that enables all Fijians in the grassroot 
<br/>level, especially indigenous entrepreneurs who are moving into real estate businesses in towns and 
<br/>cities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week in Nadi, one </span><span>Yavusa</span><span> Nakovalevu and others in Vanua Levu went through FDB, 
<br/>they now own real estate in town and some of them are government rented.  Some even are rented 
<br/>by other businesses in town but once these medium enterprises </span><span>mataqali, tikina </span><span>or </span><span>yavusa</span><span> companies 
<br/>are financed by FDB, they play a very important role too in the development of their community 
<br/>especially housing projects. Some set aside education funds, scholarship funds through Unit Trust 
<br/>and  Fijian  Holdings  for  the  future  generation.    These  are  some  of  the  trickle  down  effects  on 
<br/>investment with Fiji Development Bank which plays a very important role in elevating the economic 
<br/>status  for  all  Fijians  and  especially  the  indigenous  community  in  the  rural  areas  in  moving  into 
<br/>business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many  FDB  loans  through  various  ventures  in  the  villages,  they  are  able  to  build  their 
<br/>churches,  schools,  playgrounds  and  sports  grounds  for  their  villages.    Generally  looking  at  the 
<br/>development of the rural community and how the bank has somehow contributed and pushed their 
<br/>plans financially to be able to fulfil what we all see as part of the United Nations SDG goals on how 
<br/>to improve the livelihood so that no one is left behind.  Sir, those are few of the things that I would 
<br/>share on why this guarantee must be supported. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that it supports a very important institution, Fiji Development Bank.  The debt side 
<br/>alone is not something that we must use to go against the guarantee.  If this side of the House comes 
<br/>to become Government, we will seek guarantees too to help this institution because the important 
<br/>role that this particular institution plays to support the various programmes that are there in the budget 
<br/>and also how it affects and it has benefited many Fijians which are benefiting through the various 
<br/>programmes that are there.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I touch on a few comments regarding the 
<br/>motion at hand, listening and observing the debates in the House this morning, I believe that most of 
<br/>the honourable Members sitting on the other side of the House do not understand the meaning of a 
<br/>guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, give me a minute to explain to them what is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meaning of a guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- A guarantee is an undertaking by a person or an organisation or a 
<br/>Government in this case, to pay the loan  which is considered as bad debt, to the bank if the customer 
<br/></span><span>does not  have the ability to pay back the loan. The word, ‘if’ is right.  If the loan is recovered, then 
<br/></span><span>it is okay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Listen, listen, please!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the amount of Government guarantee that was approved in this House for the past three 
<br/>years until last year shows this - in 2018 - $291 million;  2019 - $307 million; and in 2021 - $308 
<br/>million.  Those were approved for the purpose of guarantee and to pay back a bad debt with FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the FDB annual accounts, arrears to portfolio from 2017 was 14.3 per cent of 
<br/>the  total  bank  portfolio;  2018  -  14.98  per  cent  and  2019  -  16  per  cent.  These  are  arrears  to  loan 
<br/>portfolio, not yet to become considered as a bad debt and the Bank failed to provide to us the bad 
<br/>debt to loan portfolio percentage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to tell this House that there is too much of Governments guarantee 
<br/>offered to FDB because these areas to portfolio may only have certain percentage that falls as a bad 
<br/></span><span>debt. That is where they will pay from the Governments guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Government guarantee is for the  for the promissory notes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the bonds, not individual…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- But it will finally pay back bad loans and that is guarantee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- It will later pay bad debts.

<div><span>On Monday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I explained to this House that Government guarantee being 
<br/>approved to FDB does not reflect on the FDB’s share market, especially on resource-based sector - 
<br/>agriculture. In 2018, agriculture holds a share market of 58 per cent; in 2019 - 53 per cent and in 
<br/>2020 - 52 per cent. There is no significant growth, but the amount of guarantee that has been given 
<br/>to FDB is quite high and does not reflect on the performance of FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forestry and Logging was 18 per cent in 2018, 15 per cent in 2019 and 16 per cent in 2020.  
<br/>Fisheries - 25 per cent in 2018, 33 per cent in 2019 and reduced to 26 per cent in 2020. Manufacturing 
<br/>- 9 per  cent  in 2018, 9  per  cent  in  2019 and 8  per  cent  in  2020.  So this is  where,  I believe, the 
<br/>guarantee  that  we  are  approving  here  has  to  be  reflected  in  here  because  according  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank Act is to assist in the development of our economy through providing financial 
<br/>assistance to the agriculture sector, industrial sector and commercial sector.  But it does not reflect 
<br/></span><span>on the market share of the FDB and I warn this Government, please, do not push the FDB to be a 
<br/></span><span>zombie, like the FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know what happened to FSC?  We poured funds to FSC - millions and millions, but they 
<br/>failed to analyse FSC’s performance and that is why FSC is now technically insolvent.  There is no 
<br/>control, no feedback, no follow up and no evaluation, that is why it is insolvent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is not insolvent, do not lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Technically insolvent.  It is on life support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I do not  understand why we are still approving guarantee to  FDB when 
<br/>FDB, as I have already said, is not performing well.  Although it is good, but it is not good enough 
<br/>to have an impact on our economy.   Look at FDB’s autonomous situation in our economy.  They 
<br/>should  be  the  leading  financial  institution  in  agriculture,  commercial  and  industrial  development 
<br/>because they are receiving guarantee.  We gave them the guarantee so that they can lend in high risk 
<br/></span><span>areas.  That is the purpose.  So, no, we have been telling this House that we are having a narrow-
<br/></span><span>based economy, but we have the potential to expand our economy, but they are not doing their job.  
<br/>So, stop the guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Trade,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Forestry and the honourable Minister of Fisheries, stop, please, make use of 
<br/>the guarantees that have been given over the years.  It is quite a shame that only a certain percentage 
<br/>is given to the Bank in market share. I do not support, like my colleague had said, we do not support 
<br/>this Government guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute briefly to support the motion that 
<br/>has been moved by the honourable Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Economy.  Right at the 
<br/>outset, for the purposes of honourable Kuridrani, the motion actually reads, ‘pursuant to Standing 
<br/>Order  131  that  Parliament  approve  that  the  Government  guarantee  the  Fiji  Development  Bank 
<br/>borrowings  for  the  12  month  period  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  March,  2022  to  28</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023,  which  is  the 
<br/>guarantee period, through the issuance of short-term and long-term bonds, promissory notes, term 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deposits, any RBF financing facility and other short-term borrowings.’  It is actually quite simple if 
<br/>you read it.  We are not flying in there blind, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), as we all know, has been in existence 
<br/>for about 50 years and remains as the only national development financial institution in Fiji.  It is our 
<br/>job to support that particular institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bank  has  supported  economic  development  in  providing  financial  solutions  for  the 
<br/>development of our key sectors, and this has been industry, commerce and agriculture, and it has 
<br/>done so.  As alluded to earlier on in the week, Sir, the Bank has actually become a dynamic financial 
<br/>service provider for the development of the Fijian economy, especially focussing on our MSMEs and 
<br/>expanding our economic base.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  well  known,  Sir,  that  the  FDB  has  collaborated  also,  despite  what  the  Honourable 
<br/>Kuridrani  may  think.    It  has  collaborated  with  our  Ministry  and  other  Government  institution  on 
<br/>initiatives on numerous occasions, to enable access to finance for MSMEs with promising business 
<br/>proposals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I think this needs to be said, They need to be reminded that this 
<br/></span><span>guarantee of $200 million is not a grant or a loan given by the Government to FDB. It is actually 
<br/>providing a guarantee.  No money is actually going from the Fijian Government to accounts of the 
<br/>FDB under this particular motion.  It is actually quite simple to understand and hope this is clear and 
<br/>it is understood. Some may say, yes, we do know but they continue to make statements that say the 
<br/>contrary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not want any misrepresentation of facts here, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We do not want any 
<br/>misinformation. People of Fiji need to know the truth.  Sometimes, the Opposition discusses these 
<br/>matters and they continue pursuing this misinformation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just yesterday, they could not even get their facts correct when it was right 
<br/>in front of them.  Yesterday, they claimed that there were only 42 cooperatives.  But little reading 
<br/>would have told you that those were 42 new ones, and that was information being passed on to the 
<br/>general public in Fiji.  They should be ashamed of themselves, Sir. This is a public document that 
<br/>was sitting there right in front of them that said 42 cooperatives and they ran off without even looking 
<br/>or researching, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have said this yesterday and I will repeat, that we have over 400 cooperatives in Fiji.  A lot 
<br/></span><span>of them get assisted by this very institution that they are actually downplaying right now.  Today is 
<br/>no difference, Sir. Again, they are shooting off with unverified and cheap comments without any 
<br/>basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad also claims that the FDB and the Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>does nothing for the sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- I never said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just wait, just wait.  Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me remind him, once again, Sir, the FDB provided $20 million worth of support to our 
<br/>sugarcane farmers. That is not some small feat, Sir, and this is all to sugarcane farmer cooperatives 
<br/>for mechanisation and that is for the purchase of harvesters. They continue to do so by saying, no to 
<br/>what is on the table, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- When the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> comes out tomorrow, he should look 
<br/>at it.  I have not once said that the FDB has not done anything for the sugar industry, so the honourable 
<br/>Minister should stop lying and misrepresenting what I said.  I never said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Minister, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. May be the Pied Piper got to him, so he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has changed his tune.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope all the cane farmers around ….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- You’re lying! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not lying about anything.  I hope the cane farmers in Fiji are actually 
<br/></span><span>listening because he is standing here right now, singing the tunes of the Pied Piper, and the founders 
<br/></span><span>of NFP must be turning in their grave, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am serious.  The late A.D. Patel and S.M. Koya must be turning in their 
<br/>grave with the comments that you actually made.  Shame on you!  Shame on you! You come here 
<br/>and you sing the tune of the sugarcane farmers and you want to deny this - the very institution that 
<br/>helps them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not kidding, Sir. One of those founders happens to be my father, he 
<br/>must be turning in his grave, Sir.  This particular Party lost its principles. The very fact that they are 
<br/>partnering with a man that brought this country to its knees, will tell you what the problem is, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You are very disingenuous, honourable Professor Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And then he has got a twin brother, sitting here right in front of us, honourable Nawaikula.  
<br/>He tells the farmers, “Take the money and the loan and do not pay it back”, or whatever he said 
<br/>earlier on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S. KOYA.- Sorry, my  apologies.   He said,  “Take the money  and do not  vote for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them."  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, you have to question the character of this gentleman if he is actually 
<br/>telling the truth.  First of all, he suddenly decides on his own that maybe we are going to use this 
<br/>money to dish out to voters.  We do not do that.  We do not do such things at all, quite ridiculous if 
<br/>you ask me.  We do not intend to turn the FDB into one NBF, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Nawaikula also said the Fijian Government 
<br/>had guaranteed FDB loans of $1.2 billion this morning.  In fact Sir, the outstanding guarantees to 
<br/>FDB is only $344 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  He should get his facts correct.  That 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the national guarantee, not only for FDB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are actually lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Get your facts right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You talked about the total contingent liability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Of course you will support him. You are his twin brother.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, twins separated at birth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to outline the reasons why I actually support this motion and it 
<br/></span><span>is not rocket science.  All the guarantees provided by the Government to FDB have never ever been 
<br/></span><span>called upon, never been called upon.  That means the Government has never had to bail out FDB, 
<br/>never.  Therefore, it gives me as a citizen, the utmost confidence to support this particular motion 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even during the pandemic when the FDB like all financial institution in Fiji and all the rest 
<br/>of the world were adversely affected, businesses and individuals had actually struggled to pay their 
<br/>loans which meant that FDB customers were also defaulted and asked for extensions of loans but that 
<br/>simply means that FDB’s profits would be affected.  Again, FDB has an unqualified financial account 
<br/>status which was debated and passed on Monday, just on Monday, signalling a strong governance 
<br/>practice which has been led by the board and the management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previous guarantees provided to FDB, Mr. Speaker, allowed them to go out and borrow at a 
<br/>lower rate and ultimately lend below market rates for the benefit of our MSMEs and co-operatives 
<br/>and  I  will  keep  saying  co-operatives  because  that  is  what  they  were  harping  on  about  yesterday 
<br/>particularly in their economic recovery efforts, Mr. Speaker.  This will also provide opportunities for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>527 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FDB to focus into areas that commercial banks do not wish to invest in such as greenfield and climate 
<br/>financing ventures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  also  allows  them  to  assist  farmers  to  shift  from  semi-commercial  to 
<br/>commercial farming and therefore realising our own very huge potential with respect to Fijian grown 
<br/>and Fijian products to meet the demands of our local markets and also the tourism market and export 
<br/>markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition continues on their rhetoric that the FDB is not focusing on 
<br/>core  sectors.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  Opposition  just  fails  to  or  refuses  to  understand  the 
<br/>agriculture sector in Fiji, they are smallholder farmers which means the value of loans taken will be 
<br/>smaller than the non-focused industry.  The non-focus will then obviously show a smaller number of 
<br/>loan takers but a higher value, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a very simple example Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that the Opposition colleagues can understand. 
<br/>Under  the  rights  assistance  programme  for  example,  FDB  may  give  $10,000  loans  to  1,000  rice 
<br/>farmers which equates to $1 million whilst the real estate or a tourism developer may take one loan 
<br/>worth a million dollars.  This was explained earlier on by the Acting Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition definitely does not know how this financial sector works 
<br/>and by providing loans to the non-focus sector at a higher rate, FDB is actually able to cross-subsidise 
<br/>the loan for the agriculture sector and MSMEs.  So essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition is 
<br/>saying that FDB should not provide loans to the commercial sectors which enables to provide cheaper 
<br/>loans to farmers or small shop operators and the people of Fiji need to listen to this, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition basically wants the farmers and MSMEs to be deprived of getting loans at 
<br/>better interest rates.  They do not want our farmers to grow their businesses.  They will stand here 
<br/>and say you are not helping agriculture, you are not helping MSMEs, we are but what you are doing 
<br/>is not helping these very farmers and these very MSMEs.  I would also like highlight some issues 
<br/>that were brought up regarding the Pullman loan by FDB.  It has nothing to do with the guarantee, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  it.  Honourable  Tuisawau  was  just  bringing  up 
<br/>hogwash really at the end of the day, not relative to this particular motion. There are certain issues 
<br/>that remain confidential  between a bank and its customer. You cannot  go and willy-nilly ask any 
<br/>question you want with respect to these people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not ignorant of anything.  It is a private entity that is actually buying 
<br/>these particular properties. Besides if there is anything that they need and it is a matter public record, 
<br/>like feel free to go get it or write to the relevant Minister, they will give you the information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the one hand the Opposition says not to do anything for MSMEs, co-
<br/>operatives and agriculture.  The very next minute they tell the Government not to guarantee FDB 
<br/>loans and be enabling.  It is an enabling tool for MSMEs.  The only person on other side who maybe 
<br/>actually really understands it was honourable Bulitavu this morning.  He seems to understand what 
<br/>the realities on the ground are and the rest of the Opposition is still in Lalala and very delusional 
<br/>about what is actually happening. Maybe, just maybe because they are in such a mess, they should 
<br/>listen to him a whole lot more.  Obviously it will not suit their narrative or their agenda at the moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had a figure mentioned that the Government had provided a guarantee to 
<br/>the tune of $1.2 billion.  I am not sure where they actually got that particular amount from. Before I 
<br/>finish,  I  would  like  to  respond  to  some  claims  made  by  honourable  Gavoka  that  the  FijiFirst

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  is  not  doing  enough  for  cassava  farmers.    Well,  maybe  just  a  phone  call  away, 
<br/>honourable Gavoka you should have asked me. I would have told you.  I met them already, we are 
<br/>way ahead of you. Very simple, instead of coming here and crying about it.  It was very easy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I met the Tavioka Growers Association (TGA) last week, honourable Gavoka, and we will 
<br/>be working with the FDB by the way and ministries, the Ministry of Agriculture to work up whatever 
<br/>we can do to assist them. So, it is work that is already being done. So please, it would be good that 
<br/>you asked honourable Gavoka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the reasons that I have just mentioned, I 
<br/>wish to reiterate my support for the motion and request that the entire House take note and support 
<br/>the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion on the floor. As 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture,  I  feel  saddened  to  note  how  they  are  running  down  FDB  -  the  only 
<br/>development bank and how they are refusing to support Government’s support to the FDB which 
<br/>will eventually support the growth and development of the Fijian economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the growth and development of the agriculture sector is synonymous with 
<br/>the FDB.  Just yesterday, I think, we talked about how commercial banks have shy away from lending 
<br/></span><span>to the agriculture sector.  If you look at the overall loan portfolio of commercial banks going to the 
<br/></span><span>agriculture sector, it is 1 per cent.  Why?  Because it is a commercial bank, whose only motive is to 
<br/>maximise profit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  see  the  agriculture  sector  as  too  risky,  and  Fiji’s  agriculture  sector  is  very 
<br/>complicated/complex because of various aspects of the agriculture sector, in particular the land tenure 
<br/>system, the natural disasters that are happening in the country, the smallholder system that we have, 
<br/>the subsistence farmers that we have who are transiting into small and medium commercial farm, so 
<br/>because of these, we need to have a bank which tailor makes its product to address and assist us in 
<br/>transiting and migrating this subsistence smallholder farmers into medium and large farms.  To do 
<br/>that, financial support is critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now  if  you  look  at  any  production  function,  one  of  the  factor  of  production  is  finance.  
<br/>Traditionally the production function was defined as a function of output as a function of land, labour 
<br/>but then financial capital is very critical now.  Who will provide the financial capital if FDB does 
<br/>not, commercial banks, they do not want to then they will come to Government and treat the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture like a bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture is not a bank, we have continuously said to them that we are here 
<br/></span><span>to  provide  technical  support,  to  provide  our  technical  staff,  provide  all  the  advice  that  is  needed, 
<br/>secure assistance in securing the market, we want them to do farming, that is not our core business, 
<br/>we cannot finance them but we can have a development bank which raises funds on their own by 
<br/>lending to the high interest sector and using that to lend to farmers on a very low interest rate.  That 
<br/>is exactly what they have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the FDB loans portfolio, majority is to the agriculture sector and what all they 
<br/>need is a guarantee so that they can borrow and then provide that pool of money to the smallholder 
<br/>farmers  who  we  were  wanting  to  migrate  into  small  and  large.    Just  this  week  I  showed  that 
<br/>agriculture now is transforming, the sector is transforming and is now becoming one of the top export 
<br/>earners  amongst  the  others.    And  we  also  demonstrated  that  over  the  last  18  months  during  the 
<br/>pandemic, it is the agriculture Sector that has held the fort.  People started to move back to agriculture.  
<br/>They realised that this is one sector that is in our control.

<div><span>Yesterday  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Gavoka  stood  up  and  said  FDB  should  support 
<br/>cassava farmers.  </span><span>Areh!</span><span> Last  week FDB  approved a loan of $254,000 to  a processor who collects 
<br/>cassava from farmers, processes it into cassava flour and exports.  There you go!  Why only Cassava 
<br/>Growers Association?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  are  the  kind  of  people  who  we  need  to  support  because  they  are 
<br/>creating a market and also opening up new export markets and bringing in foreign currency into the 
<br/>country.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not understand.  We need foreign currency. How do we pay for 
<br/>the cotton and medicines we import?  Come on, look, let us get to the basic, if you want a lecture on 
<br/>the basics, we are happy to do that. I mean some Cassava Growers Association or Dalo Growers 
<br/>Association, if they want a loan, they should come to FDB.  FDB cannot go and look for them where 
<br/>they are and this processor who collects the cassava from various farmers, provides a market to them.  
<br/>They came to us, we said look let us go to FDB and part of a Commercial Farmers Equity Programme, 
<br/>they have secured a loan of $250,000 and they are now exporting.  They are now exporting flour. 
<br/>They are processing flour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, cassava is one of the easiest crop to grow, least cost, grows in any kind of 
<br/>soil type and it is something that is also widely consumed in Fiji.  We want to promote cassava, we 
<br/></span><span>spoke to one of the two major flour companies in Fiji, we have done research at Koronivia Research 
<br/></span><span>Station,  we  noted  that  we  can  mix  30  per  cent  cassava  maximum  and  we  can  have  a  good  flour 
<br/>product which we can then market, so that our people can buy that and create a new market for these 
<br/>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Members on the other side to leave party politics aside 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and support this motion on the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief in my contribution 
<br/>to the motion.  Let me start by saying that I was indeed shocked and even appalled by the contribution 
<br/>from  the  other  side  of  the  House,  given  the  very  robust  debate  that  we  had  on  Monday  on  the 
<br/>2019Annual Report for FDB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every honourable Member of this august House and even in the debate on 
<br/>Monday  acknowledged  the  importance  of  FDB  and  the  role  that  it  plays  and  particularly  to  the 
<br/>ordinary Fijians that we want to support.  No one denied that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But come today there 
<br/>is  a  change  in  position  again  which  confirms  one  thing  to  me;  they  are  not  good  for  national 
<br/>leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  I  say  that  again,  they  are  not  good  for  national 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to Nelson Mandela when you keep changing your principles and 
<br/>your change  your positions based on the audience and the political  climate,  you are not  good for 
<br/>national leadership and that exactly is what the Opposition is portraying to us today.  Sad to say! 
<br/>They could have done better, support the guarantee but these are the things that needs to be done. We 
<br/>acknowledged the contributions that were made on Monday. As I have stated, to me it is shocking 
<br/>and appalling.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Monday, this is what the honourable Professor Prasad stated, but imagine 
<br/>if FDB had focused where their priority should have been. If the Government had focussed on the 
<br/>agriculture sector, if it had not destroyed the sugar industry, if we were still producing three million

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tonnes of cane, if were still having the dairy industry that we used to have and he continues, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes, he did say that, but that is why the existence of 
<br/>FDB is so important and that is why this guarantee as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is so important.  They 
<br/>keep changing positions.  But this is exactly why I stated that they are not good for national leadership 
<br/>because they are just focusing on elections, elections and elections.  This Government is about the 
<br/>long-term benefit that it will bring to the country.  If we win again in the next elections, so be it.  But 
<br/>this is important for the country and this is important for the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely, absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Any politician with the right mind should support this, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we need FDB to function. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say this, this is not the first guarantee for FDB by any Government.  
<br/>We have been providing the guarantee for FDB since it existence and 2022 is not an exception year, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because that is the responsibility of Government. There are people employed in 
<br/>FDB, there are clients of FDB and we have the very people that we want to assist the ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We talked about the primary industries and there was a lot of focus the other day on the non-
<br/>focus sector and the focus sectors. But how can we provide this assistance when we do not want to 
<br/>provide the guarantee. What will happen tomorrow?  This is the short sightedness on the other side 
<br/>of the House.   Let us be strategic and take our responsibilities seriously because this is an institution 
<br/>that we badly need to function and function well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me go to the sugar industry.  According to honourable Professor Prasad, 
<br/>if it had not destroyed the sugar industry.  A few weeks back, I was listening to an interview by Mr. 
<br/>Satish Rai, I think this gentleman lives in Australia, and he was interviewing the late Professor Brij 
<br/>Lal.  The topic was “Internal Displacement in Fiji”.  When did this internal displacement start, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir?  The late 1990s.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  1997,  the  30  years  ALTA  leases  were  expiring.  The  late  Professor  Brij  Lal  was  being 
<br/></span><span>interviewed by Mr. Satish Rai under the </span><span>Spice of Life</span><span> programme by Michelle Schuelke.  The topic 
<br/>was, Internal Displacement in Fiji.  As I have stated, Mr. Speaker, it started in the late 1990s - 1997.  
<br/>This is the comment by the late Professor Brij Lal, “The sugar industry is in the doldrums.”  For few 
<br/>reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The uncertainty of renewal of leases is one problem; 
<br/>The imminent expiry of preferential access to the EU; and  
<br/>The collapsing infrastructure of mills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So those problems were there in the late 1990s.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, he keeps on blaming this Government for all the problems in the sugar industry.  This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is what the late Professor Brij Lal stated, and I quote:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The industry with which our people were associated over a century was on the 
<br/>decline.    Unfortunately,  our  leaders  did  not  have  the  foresight  to  encourage 
<br/>diversification to face this eventuality.  What were they doing?”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- What have you done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We have done  a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at the state of the mills, look at the efficiency of the mills now, look at CBUL.  They 
<br/>were busy with the Constitution from 1995 to 1997.  This was one of the priorities that should have 
<br/>been sorted out then, because it affects ordinary Fijians, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It hurts, eh?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FDB is doing a wonderful job and we should thank the new CEO, Mr. Saud 
<br/>Minam, and of course, those who have served in FDB and have brought it to its current state, and 
<br/>most importantly under the new CEO.  We see hope in the way forward.  It is promising, although 
<br/>we know that we are in this challenging economic environment, but it is not only Fiji, the whole 
<br/>world is affected.  But the directions give us hope and that is why we support this guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last Saturday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he just released an article about one of the major programmes 
<br/></span><span>that they have launched already.  In fact they have started with the first project in December last year, 
<br/>it is called the “Agriculture Value Chain Financing” method.  I think the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture did mention it yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard it so many times in this august House. Agriculture in Fiji for so long  have 
<br/>merely focussed on production and we neglected the whole value chain, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is 
<br/>exactly where Mr. Saud Minam and his team are taking agriculture and of course the country in terms 
<br/>of its economic development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, they have started in December last year with the rice mobility package and 
<br/>they also have intentions to target ginger, dairy and of course maybe into cassava as well.  That is 
<br/>why we need this guarantee, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is so important and most importantly, let me remind 
<br/>the other side of the House. If we deny this guarantee to Fijians, we are denying the right to access 
<br/>the finance and therefore have sustained and improved livelihoods. That is what will happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us get out of this election thing.  We have a responsibility and I hope 
<br/>that we will live up to that expectation and support this guarantee. As I have stated again, it is not 
<br/></span><span>new. We have been doing this every year but not only because its election year, let us not support 
<br/></span><span>this guarantee. So, I urge the other side of the House it is not too late to support this motion that we 
<br/>have before this august House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  this  side  of  the  House  has  been  able  to 
<br/>elucidate quite well why we need to support this particular motion.  I share the honourable Minister’s 
<br/>feeling that some of the comments that I have heard from the other side are quite appalling.  I think 
<br/>it does not reflect on the fact that we in this House need to think about what is best for our country. 
<br/>We have seen a lot of pontificating. We have seen a lot focus on the elections.  We must remember 
<br/>that we are here to do what is best for this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  the  comments  from  honourable  Minister  Koya,  honourable  Minister  Reddy  and 
<br/>honourable Minister Seruiratu have pointed to the fact that this is a critical organisation.  Some of 
<br/>the things that we are talking about guarantees and all of these things, remember this is a guarantee. 
<br/>Also remember that Fiji Development Bank is not like any other bank.  People do not deposit money 
<br/>into Fiji Development Bank and it works in an environment which is far more risky.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So to have this Government guarantee allows them to source money 
<br/>through promissory notes and whatever that they issue, that people are willing to give them money 
<br/>because  they  know  Fiji  Development  Bank  works  in  a  risky  business.  If  Fiji  Development  Bank 
<br/>cannot  deliver  it  then  Government  will  pay  for  it.    Remember  that!    But  why  is  this  absolutely 
<br/>important because this is the only bank that is delving into that sector because it is risky.  It is a risky 
<br/>business and as leaders we need banks to give money into that sector. If the commercial banks are 
<br/>not going to do it, who is going to do it?  For the betterment of this country, who?  Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank is the only one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, as national leaders must support Fiji Development Bank.  We have been talking about 
<br/>diversification.  We  have  been  talking  about  the  need  to  bring  the  small  person  up  from  a  micro 
<br/>entrepreneur to a small entrepreneur to become a medium entrepreneurship.  We are talking about 
<br/>subsistence  farmers  becoming  semi-commercial  and  commercial  -  they  need  money.  They  need 
<br/>capital and this is the only place that they can go too. If you do not support this guarantee, you do not 
<br/>support those farmers.  If you do not support this, you are not supporting the micro entrepreneur who 
<br/>needs  money  to  become  a  small  entrepreneur  and  then  needs  more  money  to  become  a  medium 
<br/></span><span>entrepreneur.  You are not supporting those people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Be a leader.  Forget the elections; elections will come.  Some of us 
<br/>will be here, some of us will not be here but after those elections, you want to be able to say on that 
<br/>day, “I supported the farmers and the small businessmen of this country and if I am elected or not, I 
<br/>did the right thing for my country.”  Be a man, be a woman, do the right thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to make 
<br/>a contribution to the motion before the House. I must say at the outset that I fully support the motion 
<br/>and I thank the Chairman and the honourable Members on both sides of the House who were part of 
<br/>this Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I stand as a Minister for Health today to say that we should support the Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank  (FDB).    It  needs  ennobling  functions  in  supporting  the  social  determinants  of  health.    On 
<br/>Monday, we had our two new colleagues to this honourable House.  Honourable Ratu Jone Seniloli 
<br/>talked  about  his  interest  which  is  in  the  rural  dwellers.    We  want  the  rural  dwellers  to  be  strong 
<br/></span><span>financially and this is an institution that will support them by enabling them, by us guaranteeing by 
<br/></span><span>the State by this Parliament agreeing to it that the Government agreeing to guarantee, and allow us - 
<br/>the small shareholders, the farmers to be able to upgrade themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that many of us here would know of stories where FDB has been the financier in their 
<br/>development.  I know for sure that at some stage in our growth as a family, my parents used the FDB 
<br/>and I am probably here because of that support through the FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FDB has allowed many young people to become doctors and nurses.  Many people have 
<br/>come from rural areas and become engineers and lawyers and many of us sitting inside this august 
<br/>House on both sides have actually achieved what we have achieved through the support of the FDB.  
<br/>That is the first and primary reason why I support it because it has ennobled many, many people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  for  my  province  in  Lau,  many  have  come  into  Viti  Levu,  they  go  up  to  Waibau, 
<br/>Lomaivuna, where they have been farming.  Honourable Jale knows specifically this issue, that FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>533 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is  an ennobling institution for many migrant  communities  into Viti Levu  and Vanua  Levu.  Why 
<br/>should we not support it now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has allowed us to be here today, it has allowed many to be able to go to the university.  It 
<br/>is a means by which we can improve the social determinants of health, both in the rural areas and in 
<br/>the peri-urban areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 1</span><span>st</span><span> July 1967 when FDB was established, the board of directors then and I believe that 
<br/>most of them are not here today, made strategic decisions based on the ambitions of the FDB then.  
<br/>The Board of Directors now and the CEO will make their decisions based on what the pertaining 
<br/>environment is and their ambition remains the same, to support the development of the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want the rural dwellers to have cars, we want the rural dwellers to be able to take their 
<br/>children to better schools, we want the rural dwellers to be able to send their children overseas and 
<br/>this is an institution that can support them.  Why are we not supporting it now?  That is my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is very hypocritical of all of us in this august House, who have benefited in some 
<br/>way from the FDB to now turn our back on FDB.  It is very hypocritical.  Why?  Because Elections 
<br/></span><span>is around the corner.  Why?  Because it sounds good to our voters.  We should not, and as I have said 
<br/></span><span>before, as the Minister for Health, I want to see mechanisms by  which the social determinants of 
<br/>health are improved and this is an ennobling institution to support the social determinants of health.  
<br/>That is why I fully support the FDB and the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the honourable 
<br/>Members who have spoken, in particular those who have spoken in favour of this motion.    Sir, there 
<br/>is quite a lot to respond to, but I think a lot of it, in fact, has already been done so by the honourable 
<br/>Ministers and the speakers from this side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would appear if you were to analyse what the Opposition were saying, firstly, they seem to 
<br/>be driven by election imperatives, that is one issue.  The second argument they had, was because we 
<br/>have  been  giving  guarantees  to  FDB  year-in-year-out,  therefore  we  should  stop  giving  them 
<br/>guarantees.  The third argument is that, because the overall debt in the country is high (according to 
<br/>them), therefore, we should not give any more guarantees because it builds up contingent liability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, there is a lot of inconsistency in what they have been saying, 
<br/>comparing Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday.  If I could just address to all them really quickly Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Nawaikula said that we could have had a mature discussion if we give you all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information. He is the last person who should be talking about mature discussion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I informed the Business Committee when we had the meeting last week that 
<br/>there will be an FDB Guarantee and the Members of the Opposition were there.  It is on them if they 
<br/>did not go back and tell their Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I would like to make, the form in which we have presented 
<br/>this motion, we have adhered to the Standing Orders as we have done in the past.  We gave our 48 
<br/>hours notification of this particular motion on Monday, that is why it is being presented today, so it 
<br/>is not any ‘Quick Draw McGraw’ sort of situation here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I could just address FDB’s internal operational matters, this FDB saga 
<br/>recently  started  off  with  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro  when  Saud  Minam,  who  is  an  international 
<br/>banker, ANZ Manager was appointed.  He condemned his ethnicity, religion and usual of that.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thought it was an extremely shameful approach and this is, unfortunately, underlying premise and 
<br/>arguments of SODELPA and some of the other people outside this Parliament.  They do not look at 
<br/>the  credentials  of  the  person  and  what  he  or  she  can  bring  to  the  organisation  and  how  well  the 
<br/>organisation can do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I also like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they highlighted about the person who 
<br/>has bought Pullman.  They said he is an honorary counsel.  Honourable Professor Prasad as usual, he 
<br/>watches too many ‘C’ grade Bollywood and Hollywood movies, conspiratorial theories.  Of course, 
<br/>tenders were called and the Board then chose on the basis of the tender and the best price they can 
<br/>get.  Every single impairment, bad debt, et cetera, is presented in the FDB reports, in the audited 
<br/>accounts, and you can get access to the information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point  I would like to make regarding the issue that was raised 
<br/>about Marriott, the outstanding monies that honourable Professor Prasad talks about.  This is the deal 
<br/>that was done under the previous Government with Vuksich &amp; Borich.  That agreement was not done 
<br/>properly.  It is a legal issue and as far as Government is concerned, someone did the deal.  I will tell 
<br/>you why there was a deal, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  deal  was,  honourable  Gavoka  talked  about  syndicated  loans.    There  was  actually  a 
<br/></span><span>syndicated loan.  The main finances of the Marriott were FNPF and FDB.  Here was a much touted 
<br/>foreign investor bringing in money but the bulk of the money was actually provided by the Fijian 
<br/>people through FNPF and through FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  was  even  more  amazing  was  that,  the  syndicated  loan,  the  line  share  was  actually 
<br/>provided by FNPF and not FDB.  I think FDB exposure from memory was about $60 million to $70 
<br/>million.  A few hundred million was FNPF, or if not more.  But the manager of the syndicated loan 
<br/>was the former CEO of FDB.  And as it was revealed subsequently, the former Manager of FDB, in 
<br/>fact,  had business  interest  in  the development  of Marriott.    In that environment was that contract 
<br/>done.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this information is actually available and available publicly 
<br/>also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the particular Act and the rationale that was given as to why we actually had to 
<br/>do the Act, similarly with Natadola where FNPF participated with an undischarged bankrupt from 
<br/>Europe.  Yet, he was hailed as some great tourism developer.  If, in fact, if that law was not put in 
<br/>place in Natadola (honourable Jale was involved in that Board then), FNFP would have lost over 
<br/>billion dollars just in Natadola.  Those laws had to be put in place to rescue FNPF and FDB at that 
<br/></span><span>point in time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is history, they do not tell that. This is what we call obscurantism.  They are trying to 
<br/>basically duck and weave in the process trying to come up with all these narratives that actually do 
<br/>not make sense, nor were they half -baked truths.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would also like to make is the issue about FDB and 
<br/>what  is  the  focus  of  FDB.  This  law  was  put  in  place  in  the  1960s.  The  Fijian  economy  had 
<br/>substantially  changed since then.  We had a nascent  tourism industry, honourable Gavoka knows 
<br/>this.  In  the  1960s,  we  only  had  about  two  or  three  major  hotels  and  that  was  it.    The  Fijian  and 
<br/>Korolevu, may be they were the two major ones, and then it grew.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, some of them benefit from it.  Organisations like Foods Pacific, George Patel and 
<br/>them, they got money to actually set up their factory, starting in the manufacturing industry.  None 
<br/>from the Opposition have spoken about this.  I spoke about the BPO outsourcing, 3,000 jobs in two 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022

<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>535 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years, 100,000 jobs in 10 years, but none of them have spoken about it.  Should FDB not participate 
<br/>in that the space, if the need arises without necessarily neglecting agriculture?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Seruiratu actually highlighted a major point and also honourable Koya about the 
<br/>agriculture sector itself.  We have been saying in this space that agriculture leases were only given 
<br/>for 30 years. So that is why it is high risk, you cannot really use the land as collateral. That is why 
<br/>commercial banks do not lend in that space, so FDB steps in. That is what it has been happening and 
<br/>these  are  systematic  issues.    They  do  not  want  to  address  it.    Honourable  Nawaikula  also  knows 
<br/>exactly what Honourable Seruiratu is talking about the non-renewal of leases in the 1990s when he 
<br/>was part of iTLTB, together with Mr. Qarikau.  These are the historical factual basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the figures here.  Today, in the sugarcane industry, 43 per cent of 
<br/>sugarcane farmers produce less than 100 tonnes. Sir, 75 per cent produced below 150 tonnes, that is 
<br/>it.  You multiply that by $85 a tonne, take out the expenses and that is how much money they make 
<br/>in a year.  That is with the guaranteed price, imagine if they had the world market prices, they will 
<br/>be getting $60 a tonne.  That is the state of affairs of the sugarcane industry.  And we have an aging 
<br/>population, et cetera.  We are trying to get mechanical harvestation being done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why most cane farmers still are cane farmers because if they have the sugarcane 
<br/></span><span>lease, if they stop planting sugarcane, the lease will be taken away.  Where will they go?  They are 
<br/>going to live in some squatter area between Nausori and Suva?  That is precisely what happened 
<br/>when 50 per cent of the leases were not renewed in Vanua Levu.  That is why they are still hanging 
<br/>on. So, they become a lot more vulnerable to politicians who want to use them as political fodder.  “I 
<br/>will do this, I will do that”, and they are extremely vulnerable.  We are trying to get them to diversify.  
<br/>This is the hard core reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I also want to make was that and I will get to the debt issue.  
<br/>Even if you look at FDB in the past, Sir, as honourable Seruiratu said, since its inception, FDB has 
<br/>always got Government guarantee.  Honourable Kuridrani is absolutely on the wrong path.  He thinks 
<br/>when there is a loan default by an individual customer, as honourable Usamate pointed out, does not 
<br/>mean the guarantee will be called upon, because FDB does make some profit too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they lend, say to George Patel, they may charge him 12.5 per cent interest but when 
<br/>they lend to a farmer in Wainunu Bay to plant his dalo, he may be charged 3.5 per cent.  That is what 
<br/>you call cross subsidisation.  If the Wainunu Bay farmer goes belly- up, in other words, he cannot 
<br/>pay his loan, it does not mean they come running to the Government and say we want the guarantee.  
<br/></span><span>Even when Ampol went belly-up, this is the great supermarket chain that is going to be set up; even 
<br/></span><span>when  FDB  facilitated  $20  million  to  help  the  elites  by  Class  A  shares  in  Fijian  Holdings,  the 
<br/>guarantee was not called upon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Gavoka should know this because we have had discussions on 
<br/>this. It was only the elites who actually got the loan.  Maybe for everyone but who got the loan, he 
<br/>did not get the loan.  That is the reality and what really is quite mindboggling is that they do not want 
<br/>to discuss these issues and they tried only to go back to a particular period in time not wanting to 
<br/>address the legacy issues because you cannot address a fundamental economic sector or position in 
<br/>the  economy  without  going  back  in  time  and  why  we  are  where  we  are  today  because  of  what.  
<br/>Honourable  Biman  Prasad  like  a  petulant  imbecile  actually  just  stops  as  long  as  it  suits  his  new 
<br/>master, the narrative must start from there.  That is what happens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I would like to make, there has been a lot of talk about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cassava farmers and other people.

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Your excessive interventions goes to show you are on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>weak ground.  The ginger farmers, in the last eight months has received nearly $1 million in loans.   
<br/>Honourable Radrodro note this, a lot of them are from Naitasiri.  There is a new package being put 
<br/>in place for ginger farmers in the next season.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to 
<br/>make was in respect of the debt situation.  It is critically important because they harped on about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to by way of contextualisation because the global pandemic has affected the 
<br/>entire globe, the debt to GDP ratio of a country like Fiji.  Maldives, which is tourism based sector, 
<br/>debt to GDP ratio in 2019 was 78.3 per cent.  In 2021, it was 137.2 per cent. Bahamas, the debt to 
<br/>GDP ratio was 59.7 per cent in 2019 and 102.5 per cent in 2021. Saint Lucia - the debt to GDP ratio 
<br/>was 61.4 per cent, 95.6 per cent. Mauritius - 84.6 per cent in 2019 and 101 per cent in 2021.  Just to 
<br/>give an example of a large country Japan - 235.4 per cent in 2019, now 256.9 per cent. Closer to 
<br/>home, New Zealand, - 32 per cent debt to GDP ratio in 2019, now it is 52 per cent. Seychelles - 57.7 
<br/>per cent in 2019, now it is 81.9 per cent. Australia – 46.6 per cent debt to GDP ratio in 2019, now 
<br/>62.1 per cent.  There is a whole list of other countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My point being by way of contextualising it is that Fiji is not the only country and if you look 
<br/></span><span>at the debt situation in Fiji, prior to COVID-19 we were on a downward trajectory.  They do not 
<br/>mention that at all.  This is what you call intellectual dishonestly.  We have been on a downward 
<br/>trajectory and we were sitting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at 46 per cent and 49 per cent when </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>
<br/>came along and then as a result of COVID-19 we shot through the roof.  Obviously not of our making 
<br/>but the point that I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir is this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of 2006, the debt to GDP ratio was 53.3 per cent. It rose to 56.2 per cent in 2010.  
<br/>Following this, Mr. Speaker, Sir the debt to GDP ratio was on a steady downward path, declining to 
<br/>43.5 per cent in 2016-2017. This was a decline of close to 13 per centage points in just six years then 
<br/>of course with </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and many other natural disasters and with additional borrowing our debt 
<br/>to GDP ratio rose to 48.4 per cent in 2018-2019, still below 50 per cent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, so pre-
<br/>COVID-19 even though the nominal value of our debt had increased from $2.8 billion in 2016 to 
<br/>$5.7 billion at the end of 2018-2019, the debt to GDP ratio declined from 53.3 per cent to 48 per cent 
<br/>under the Bainimarama Government and the FijiFirst Government, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, why did the debt to GDP decline?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very simple because our nominal 
<br/>GDP grew much faster, so if the value of a GDP goes up then obviously the debt to GDP will come 
<br/></span><span>down.  This is the result of the nine years of consecutive growth.  They go on about  the three per 
<br/></span><span>cent.  They go on oh only three per cent. No, but it is the fact.  They go on about the fact that oh it is 
<br/>only three per cent but that is a direct result of it.  Our GDP, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nominal value 
<br/>grew from $5.3 billion to $11.8 billion in the same period. That is a phenomenal rate of growth, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, then of course we had COVID-19. Tax revenue fell by 50 per centage on 
<br/>average every month.  We lost almost $1.4 billion in 12 months in tax revenues.  So, in two years we 
<br/>lost $2.8 billion in tax revenue.  That is a fact.  During the same period we had other new non-inflows 
<br/>like budget support grants and divestment receipts, however, to maintain public expenditure, Sir, at 
<br/>around $3.7 billion which includes $500 million provided in unemployment benefit and other support 
<br/>measures Government had to borrow $2 billion in the last two financial years.  Now this is where the 
<br/>Opposition is saying that we should not have borrowed.  They are saying you should not have not 
<br/>borrowed.  I think someone at the back said </span><span>dinau</span><span> and all this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, basically if we had not borrowed and our revenues had shot down and our GDP had gone 
<br/>down,  that  means  we  should  cut  expenditure  by  $2  billion,  that  is  what  they  are  saying.    Do  not

<div><span> Government Guarantee – Fiji Development Bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>537 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>borrow, cut expenditure by $2 billion, live within your means they say. Alright that would have been 
<br/>disastrous. Well if it is not a bad idea, alright let us see where will they have cut?  Would they have 
<br/>cut civil servants pay?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prasad had prompted that, the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> article 10 per cent.  I think Narube said 
<br/>cut it by 30 per cent.  We decided not to cut it and guess what the civil service pay bill is, we pay the 
<br/>civil servants over a billion dollars in salary every year.  That is the cost of running a civil service 
<br/>wages alone. Social Welfare for Poverty Alleviation - $145 million, Free Education – directly $60 
<br/>million, TELS and Toppers - $150 million, Unemployment Support - $500 million, Police Budget - 
<br/>$184 million, Ministry of Health - $403 million, Education - $442 million, Sugar - $ 72 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Would  they  cut  the  elections  budget,  we  do  not  have  elections?  Electricity  subsidy,  food 
<br/>rations, access to GPs, market vendors fees. Is that what they are saying that we should cut?  We 
<br/>would like the ordinary Fijian people to understand what the Opposition is saying.  The logic this 
<br/>afternoon they have said to us is that we will not guarantee the FDB loan because you should have 
<br/>cut back on the expenditure and cutting back on expenditure, Sir, we would like the Fijian people to 
<br/>know that this is what we would have cut on to save $2 billion. It is precisely what they are saying 
<br/>because they have not at any stage, at any time given any alternative.  No visible alternative.  None 
<br/></span><span>whatsoever, Mr. Speaker, Sir and they talk about continuity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that this portrays, in fact yesterday or today when some of 
<br/>the Members of the Opposition were speaking someone text me.  They said thank God they were not 
<br/>in Government, can you imagine how they would run Government in the COVID-19 times because 
<br/>of  the  indecisive  leadership.  We  heard  someone  saying  no  vaccination,  someone  is  saying 
<br/>vaccination, someone is saying lockdown, someone is saying do not lock down.  This is the kind of 
<br/>inconsistency and indecisiveness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SODELPA  is  shattered  in  itself  internally.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  what  would  have 
<br/>happened, we like the ordinary people to understand what the Opposition is saying.  We would like 
<br/>all  those  people  who  have  now  received  loans  for  micro,  small,  medium  enterprises  and  large 
<br/>enterprises that the loans they have got, we are giving them financing for their working capital to pay 
<br/>wages, electricity rates et cetera to continue with their business, these people do not want you to have 
<br/>that.  That is what they are saying, it is precisely what they are saying.  They do not want that cassava 
<br/>processor, the ginger farmers to get their loans that is precisely what they are saying, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have talked about ministers should get the pay-cut, they have already 
<br/></span><span>got a pay-cut, you all have got a 20 per cent, even if you cut your pay even more, you still get about 
<br/></span><span>a million dollars.  You are not going to make a dent in the $2 billion that you are proposing to cut.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is this, if we had not injected those funds, with tourism in the 
<br/>decline, firstly we would not have been able to provide those services.  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>our foreign reserves would have been shattered by borrowing more from offshore, we are allowing 
<br/>more foreign exchange to actually come into the country, so our foreign exchange is buoyed.  As a 
<br/>result of that also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our liquidity is buoyed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we are not scrambling around for money when the economies is now is going to grow.  
<br/>They are saying, “Oh, how can you have this projected growth rates?”  Any imbecile, any person of 
<br/>fundamental knowledge of economy would say yes, we are starting off with a lower base. Yes our 
<br/>GDP value has gone down, we have already said that. So, when you are going to grow from that it 
<br/>will be much higher rate of grown, anyone knows that.  So, tourism if you are shut down for two 
<br/>years and suddenly you get 30,000 tourist average every month, that is growth, that is opening up the 
<br/>economy, more people are getting employed, more boat from Denarau will go out, more will sell 
<br/>their vegetables, that is what the growth  is about and they are questioning it.  ANZ is saying 20 to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25 per cent growth. Westpac is saying 11 per cent of growth.  ADB is saying they are about the same, 
<br/>our macro-economic committee is saying 10 per cent.  Why are there so many variants? It is because 
<br/>people do not know because this is a one in a hundred-year event and nobody had been able to predict 
<br/>that and so we, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have been prudent in the way about not just managing the finances 
<br/>but also in terms of our planning and in terms of ensuring that the economy still keeps on turning 
<br/>over.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the $360, it not only provided people with some form of relief but it put money into the 
<br/>system. That is what you call managing the economy is about, not about some short-term political 
<br/>gaffe.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we had not done what we had also done, it would have meant the Fijian 
<br/>dollar  would  have  had  to  be  devalued.    As  it  is,  the  commodity  prices  in  the  world  is  rising,  I 
<br/>highlighted that yesterday.  The world fuel price is going up, wheat price is going up, freight cost is 
<br/>going up, if our dollar was devaluated Sir, the cost of things would have been even through the roof 
<br/>by now even more so. So, again Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to understand that this is the situation that 
<br/>we were in, this is the situation that we are in and we need to be able to deal with it and we have got 
<br/>a plan regarding it and to now say because of this, therefore we are not going to give our support to 
<br/>the FDB guarantee is completely short-sightedness.  It is in fact quite irresponsible, almost negligible, 
<br/>it is actually negligent to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already highlighted, one other point that I would like to make which 
<br/>seems to be also lost on the Opposition, the recent loans that we have acquired Sir, the interest rates, 
<br/>JICA - 0.01 per cent, IDA - 0.75 per cent loans, Sir.  So, when you have a long- term loan of 40 years, 
<br/>10-year grace period with interest rate at 0.01 per cent and 0.75 per cent and inflation is much higher 
<br/>than that, you actually end up having nearly 60 per cent of the loan as a grant. That is what happens.  
<br/>In fact they are telling you gently, we are giving you a grant.  They do not call it a grant, they call it 
<br/>a loan because they want you to still have some skin in the game.  So, we say we charge you 0.01 per 
<br/>cent, they do not understand that.  They say, “Oh, debt but what is the cost of the debt? What is the 
<br/>cost of the debt?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the cost of the debt, this is why we like the re-classification in the World Bank and 
<br/>ADB so that we can get cheaper loans. So the loans that we acquire now to build infrastructure and 
<br/>make sure our economy progresses in the future, they do not have to pay much at all. That is the 
<br/>reality.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  now  thank  all  the  members  in  fact  who  supported  this 
<br/>particular motion. We like to also wish FDB all the best and the team and management for putting 
<br/>this together for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
