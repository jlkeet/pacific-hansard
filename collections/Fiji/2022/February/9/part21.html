<div><span>Financial Relief – </span><span>TC Cody 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 21/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development</span><span> </span><span>inform  Parliament  of  any 
<br/>financial relief to be provided to businesses that suffered losses as a result of flooding 
<br/>caused by </span><span>TC Cody?</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  this 
<br/>question.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  no  specific  relief  package  that  has  been  set  aside  for  those 
<br/></span><span>businesses that have been affected by the flooding caused by </span><span>TC Cody.</span><span>  There are, of course, various 
<br/></span><span>facilities that are currently available for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises that those businesses 
<br/>could apply for under the scheme that was announced last year in the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  however,  for  those  people  who  are  in  the  business  of  agriculture  have 
<br/>provided assistance. Of course, we got the Fast Deploying Cash for Farmers Programme where the 
<br/>Government will provide $250 cash or cyclone affected farming households for land preparation, 
<br/>cultivation. About 20,000 households will be assisted.  Also those who are in bilateral quarantine 
<br/>arrangement in other words those farms that are actually exporting, they have also given been given 
<br/>packages valued of $176. So those are the businesses that actually have been provided with some 
<br/>form of assistance following </span><span>TC Cody</span><span>.  .  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I have a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We 
<br/>received some information that the people who were in the evacuation centres from Saturday night, 
<br/>three parts of the West and Sigatoka have yet to receive rations from Government despite being there 
<br/>72 hours to 96 hours. This is simply a humanitarian request, we just want to know what Government 
<br/>is doing about it at this stage? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this is obviously a completely unrelated question. It is 
<br/></span><span>about the distribution of ration for those in the evacuation centres.  Ration is provided to those in the 
<br/>evacuation centres after 48 hours or so.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure of the specifics of which 
<br/>evacuation centres people were not given rations.  That will be more appropriately directed to the 
<br/>Ministry of Natural Disaster Management.

<div><span>Recovery Strategies – Inshore Fisheries Sector 
<br/>(Question No. 22/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. LAL asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries inform Parliament on the commercial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recovery strategies for the inshore fisheries sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  in  the  midst  of  global 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic which has caused drastic effects on the growth of our national economy.  An 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>estimated 120,000 Fijians or one-third of the Fijian workforce lost their jobs or had their working 
<br/>hours cut as a result of this COVID-19.  In such scenarios, it is natural to assume that these people 
<br/>will resort to and depend on our natural resources as means of food security and livelihood.  The Fiji 
<br/>Inshore Fisheries are of significant to economic value, to our 850 coastal communities in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries aims to grow Fiji’s fishery sector during and after 
<br/>this COVID-19 pandemic period, which is in line with our national target of building a more resilient 
<br/>blue economy for Fiji post-COVID-19.  Our Ministry officials have been providing technical advice 
<br/>and  assistance  to  fishers  in  our  coastal  and  maritime  communities  in  terms  of  food  security  and 
<br/>economic  development.    This  is  to  alleviate  their  fishing  standard  from  subsistence  to  semi-
<br/>commercial level.   We  also  provide sustainable and effective fishing techniques and  post-harvest 
<br/>training to add more value to fishery products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of its economic recovery plan, the Ministry of Fisheries will assist 
<br/>our coastal and maritime communities through the provision of a more reliable inshore licence system 
<br/>through enhancing and fast tracking of its applications  procedure as stipulated under Fisheries Act 
<br/>Cap. 158.  This will assist our local fishers to obtain their fishing licence faster with an ultimate aim 
<br/>of sustaining their families and where possible, alleviating their fishing standard from subsistence to 
<br/></span><span>commercial  level.    This  will  also  assist  them  to  do  their  fishing  business  legally  and  reduce  the 
<br/></span><span>economic loss through illegal and unreported unregulated fishing within our fisheries water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  and  we  will  continue  to  assist  our  inshore  communities 
<br/>through the deployment of FADs around the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>or customary fishing areas.  These FADs are 
<br/>technically designed and strategically placed in oceans where water columns to attract pelagic fish.  
<br/>This pelagic species are commonly tuna and tuna-like species of, which are very high market value.  
<br/>This will assist our fishermen through the reduction of their fishing operating cost and increasing 
<br/>their economic yields.  We are also engaging the Agriculture Marketing Authority, another enterprise 
<br/>that trades fish to visit our maritime islands purchasing fish and other fishery products from their 
<br/>doorsteps.  This will help generate the needed income to communities and boost livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to assist our fishers and coastal communities 
<br/>to  sustainably  manage  their  fishery  resources  for  their  food  security,  livelihood  and  economic 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Fisheries.  Can you update us in regard to inshore fisheries with the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners?  How true 
<br/></span><span>is it that they are going to issue the </span><span>Qoliqoli </span><span>licence?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable  Member  for  the  question.  Although  this  is  a  different  question  altogether,  there  is  an 
<br/>exercise going on at the moment where fisheries will bring in a paper on tier components of fisheries 
<br/>permit  and  conclusively  where  licence  would  be  issued  and  this  document  will  be  brought  to 
<br/>Parliament for endorsement.

<div><span>CT Scan Facility &amp; Special Asthma Station </span><span>
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 23/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the status of the Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Facility and the special asthma station at 
<br/>the Lautoka Hospital? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>583 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker  and  I  thank  the    honourable 
<br/>Member for that question.  Sir, as we speak the CT Scanner in Lautoka does not work. It is actually 
<br/>10 years old and it is due for replacement. It was bought in 2011 at $1.5 million and just before the 
<br/>onset of the first wave it had malfunctioned and unfortunately it could not be repaired.  We have 
<br/>since then done our due diligence in working with our partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are procuring a CT scanner through Japan Aid and a grant through Japan which is in total 
<br/>$10 million, there is a $1.5 million investment. It weighs about 2.5 tonnes, it is a 128 helical slicer, 
<br/>the  one  that  we  have  had  in  Lautoka  before  is  one,  so  it  is  much,  much  faster.    It  can  do  three 
<br/>dimensional  figures,  including  looking  at  the  visual  organ  in  the  three  dimension.    As  we  speak 
<br/>throughout the last few weeks and months the biomedical technicians have been liaising with the 
<br/>manufacturers or the company in which we are going to procure it in terms of the base and what 
<br/>needs to be done in the room. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second question is, yes, the asthma station is working which brings me to something that 
<br/>I think it is important for all of us to know that in December, 2017 there was a fire at the hospital in 
<br/>the  operating  theatre  recovery  and  downstairs  is  the  x-ray  department  and  so,  this  then  had  gone 
<br/>through  its  repairs  and  as  I  speak  that  has  been  completed,  the  new  operating  theatre,  new  post 
<br/></span><span>anaesthetic recovery unit, up at the top and also the big renovations that have happened at the x-ray 
<br/></span><span>department below including adjacent to where the new CT scanner will sit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently  there  has  been  installed  a  large  general  x-ray  machine  which  is  ceiling-mounted 
<br/>both in Lautoka and Suva before the beginning of this year and the asthma station had to be moved 
<br/>out as part of our fever screening during the midst of the COVID-19, so it was moved out and the 
<br/>emergency department was being used as the COVID-19 intensive care unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now that all the repairs have been completed and also the surge by the Omicron has reduced, 
<br/>we  have  been  able  to  move  the  fever  stations  back  into  the  emergency  department  at  Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital.  The COVID-19 intensive care unit has gone into the newly used post-anaesthetic recovery 
<br/>unit  and  the  asthma  stations  remain  but  in  terms  of  the  management  of  patients  with  asthma,  we 
<br/>encourage them to use spacers and the puffers for those with mild asthma and nebulisation for those 
<br/>with severe disease.  </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>

<div><span> Newest Trends – Domestic Violence Helpline</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 24/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation update 
<br/>Parliament on some of the newest trends in terms of the calls received on the Domestic 
<br/>Violence Helpline? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the National Domestic Violence 24-hour toll free helpline is a project established by 
<br/>the Fijian Government  through the Ministry  of  Women, Children and Poverty  Alleviation and of 
<br/>course together with that we have our Child Helpline as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you recall domestic violence not only affects women and families but the greatest impact 
<br/>with the children as well.  So, either of the lines could be used by those seeking assistance in terms 
<br/>of children and women.  This is a project in partnership with the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre, the 
<br/>telecom companies mainly Telecom Fiji Limited, Vodafone and Digicel.  It started in 2017 where 
<br/>we got the initial funding of $200,000 per year for the operation and this has continued since then.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Helpline Mr. Speaker, Sir, provides services for all women and girls and like I said children and 
<br/>anyone  with  concerns  about  domestic  violence  in  Fiji.  This  is  in  line  with  our  motto  “Making 
<br/>domestic violence everyone’s business”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You do not have to be a victim, you could be a bystander and you can report cases on these 
<br/>lines.  To contact  the  Helpline Centre based in  Suva, we have helpline  workers who will answer 
<br/>phone calls from women and anybody else who is going to report domestic violence and this could 
<br/>be victims, survivors and bystanders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You call the Helpline with no cost incurred, access accurate domestic violence information, 
<br/>access  essential  services  which  includes  counselling,  post-rape  care  support,  safety  and  security 
<br/>access to justice and other services. The Helpline, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also reaches out to every women 
<br/>in need of help and protection whereby their calls are responded to.   It is a platform for networking 
<br/>amongst organisations and to provide linkages to support systems and facilitate provision of timely, 
<br/>appropriate and quality services for survivors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Helpline also ensures that there are counsellors and referrals are made for anyone who 
<br/>seeks the assistance of the Government and we will make sure anyone who is accessing or addressing 
<br/></span><span>issues is trained to best practice standards.  In addition to that Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to 
<br/></span><span>inform the House that we are in the process of opening a safe-house and this year’s budget has been 
<br/>allocated where we will assist any survivor or a victim who needs overnight shelter or shelter for a 
<br/>couple of days while their cases are addressed and this safe-house is located in Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  the  National  Domestic  Violence  Helpline,  that  is  1,560  until  November, 
<br/>2021 has answered 9,452 cumulative genuine calls since the Helpline was launched on 8</span><span>th</span><span> March, 
<br/>2017.  From 2017, the Helpline noted a continuous increase in calls received at the Helpline with 57 
<br/>per cent of calls related to domestic violence.  In the 2020-2021 fiscal year, the Helpline recorded a 
<br/>total of 3,612 calls, the highest since the establishment of the helpline, of these calls 51 per cent were 
<br/>domestic violence related.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  beginning  of  the  first  wave  of  COVID-19  pandemic  and 
<br/>lockdown in March, 2020, the Helpline noted the following trends for April compared to March of 
<br/>the same year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was an increase of 334 per cent calls to the Helpline,  
<br/>Increase of 190 per cent domestic violence related calls both survivors and bystanders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>An increase of 213 per cent calls from survivors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second wave of COVID-19 and lockdown in April, 2021 shows the following trend for 
<br/>May compared to April, 2021. There was an increase of 233 per cent of calls. There was an increase 
<br/>in 267 per cent domestic violence related calls and an increase of 292 calls from survivors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of us may see these increases as shocking but I would say that these 
<br/>increases in domestic violence calls and cases is a confidence in our system, that women are now 
<br/>more willing to come forward knowing that they will access justice and help. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government will ensure that we continue to monitor our Government initiative, 
<br/>unafraid of whatever challenges that will inevitably present themselves.  We are in this for a long 
<br/>hold and piece by piece we will pull back the balance that will see women, girls and children in Fiji 
<br/>no longer living lives of terror and fear and no longer subject to control and retribution.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>585 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government will be there to support the survivors, the vulnerable, the battered women 
<br/>and abused children. We will be there to hold perpetrators to account and speak out against anyone 
<br/>who has any inkling that any violence against women and children is either acceptable or justifiable 
<br/>in  any  circumstances.    No  violence  at  any  one  time  against  our  women,  girls  and  children  is 
<br/>acceptable and we will hold perpetrators to account.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administration of Gazetted Villages </span><span>
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 25/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Sugar 
<br/>Industry, Foreign Affairs and Forestry update Parliament on the arrangements in place 
<br/>for the administration of gazetted villages under the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I looked at this question, I did ask 
<br/>honourable Leawere yesterday, “what specifically do you want?”, because if you look at the question 
<br/>itself, Sir, it talks about what  are the arrangements in place for the administration of gazetted villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  arrangements  in  place,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course  are  under  the  Itaukei  Affairs  Act.  
<br/>Under the Act, there are numerous pieces of regulations. So they start off with the iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>Provincial Council Regulation, the iTaukei Affairs Tikina and Village Council Regulations, iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs Board Regulations, iTaukei Affairs Declaration of iTaukei Settlements as iTaukei Villages 
<br/>(Bylaws of 2010), and, of course, iTaukei Affairs Boundaries Regulation that go back to 1966.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then you have the different Provincial Councils and difference Provinces that have their own 
<br/>Public Health By-laws that were put in place, most of them in 1969.  So all of those are there and 
<br/>that is what actually administers it.  He said to me that we have not updated them and it is time for 
<br/>review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The latest one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which obviously has been an issue which I like to highlight, 
<br/>specifically  to  go  to  the  villages  themselves,  the  village  confirmation  gazetting,  of  course,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, has been going on since 1894.  Currently, they have 1,171 registered villages and out 
<br/>of those villages, 1,151 have been demarcated with 657 villages gazetted.  Mr. Speaker, 494 villages 
<br/>were approved by the  Board for  gazetting at  its  last meeting on 31</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2021, just a few 
<br/>months back, with the remaining 20 awaiting the consents of the Land Owning Units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, Honourable Member was concerned about the number of informal 
<br/>settlements  and  how  they  actually  become  villages.    If  I  could  just  read  out  to  him  and  this  is  a 
<br/>regulation put in place in 2010.  As we know a lot of these settlements are now becoming quite large, 
<br/>and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Board shall have the power to register iTaukei settlements to be a village. 
<br/>When  assessing  an  i  Taukei  settlement’s  suitability  for  registration  as  a  village,  the 
<br/>Board must ensure that the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proposed site must be on i Taukei land within the land boundary of its parent Yavusa; 
<br/>Proposed village must be sited on i Taukei land and where majority of the members 
<br/>of  the  Land  Owning  Unit  of  the  land  concerned  has  agreed  to  surrender  in  the 
<br/>traditional manner, ownership rights to such land which would, after the registration 
<br/>be owned communally by the new village;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inhabitants of the village are from the </span><span>yavusa </span><span>and have recognised and accepted a 
<br/>leader of the new village; 
<br/>new village when registered will be the new village of the inhabitants and will be 
<br/>accepted for such purpose for all official transactions including the </span><span>Vola ni Kawabula 
<br/></span><span>(VKB) which shall go through the processes as required by written law.  The new 
<br/>village will also be registered as such by the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Lands Commission; 
<br/>site has been certified by the health authorities to be posing no threat to the health of 
<br/>the inhabitants and that it has a reliable source of fresh water; 
<br/>site has been certified by the Director of Disaster Management Office as safe from 
<br/>natural hazards such as flooding, landslide or erosions; 
<br/>request for registration must be made in writing with the endorsement and support of 
<br/>the relevant </span><span>tikina </span><span>and provincial councils; 
<br/>the boundaries on the proposed village has been demarcated by the iTaukei Lands 
<br/>Commission.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is obviously a growing issue as we have seen many villages that become 
<br/>large.    What  is  also  critically  important,  Sir,  is  that  a  lot  of  these,  as  we  know  that  the  law  was 
<br/>amended under the Bainimarama Government that those people who live in villages and are under 
<br/></span><span>the VKB and have the right to have access to the land, can now withdraw their FNPF funds.  So they 
<br/></span><span>can withdraw up to 50 per cent to build their home in the village.  Before it was not allowed for them 
<br/>to be able to access those funds, so now they can take out that money to build their homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is critically important that those settlements that want to be classified as villages go through 
<br/>this process so they can also take out the money from FNPF and build their own homes because the 
<br/>theory behind it, of course, and it is obviously in practise that if you are a member of the VKB in that 
<br/>particular </span><span>yavusa, </span><span>no one can take away the land from you because you communally have ownership 
<br/>of the land.  That is one of the recent regulations put in place in 2010 to be able to facilitate that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know how many Members in the Opposition have actually read this 
<br/>particular set of regulations.  It is very extensive, of course, some of it goes back to 1960s, but if you 
<br/>look at it, you have for example, each province has its own village by-laws; all of them go back to 
<br/>1969.  The Namosi Province Public Health Village ByLaws 1969, Nadroga-Navosa everywhere else 
<br/>has it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are certain  provisions now Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  these regulations  that perhaps is  no 
<br/>longer applicable to those villages that already have access to water and sanitation.  They did not 
<br/></span><span>have access to previously, they talked about latrines, if you go to a lot of villages, I am not saying no 
<br/></span><span>village has latrines anymore.  There are obviously some villages with latrines but a number of villages 
<br/>do not have latrines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, that is not applicable to that, there are various issues, for example, cleaning of 
<br/>villages.  It says that each occupier of a house shall be responsible for cleaning an area within a radius 
<br/>of 1.9 metres around his or her dwelling house, kitchen, dining house, if any and latrine for keeping 
<br/>such area free from refuse, rubbish and offensive matter and receptacles wherein mosquitoes may 
<br/>breed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provincial Councils shall take such responsible services and maybe necessary to ensure that 
<br/>taking  of  similar  of  measure  in  the  remaining  area  of  each  village  provided  that  if  the  area  of

<div><span>Ease of Doing Business Report</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 26/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport inform 
<br/>Parliament  why  the  World  Bank  has  discontinued  the  annual  Ease  of  Doing  Business 
<br/>Report and what impact will it have on our business-related reforms? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S.KOYA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A very 
<br/>pertinent  question  especially  when  this  is  something  that  the  Opposition  and  I  am  referring  to 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad who like to actually flaunt this report in our faces quite frequently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  September,  2021  the  World  Bank  Group  issued  a  statement  on  the 
<br/>discontinuation of Doing Business Report.  The World Bank noted in their statement that trust in the 
<br/></span><span>research is actually vital.  If I could just read the line with respect of the statement and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“After data the irregularities on Doing Business in 2018 and 2020 were reported 
<br/>internally in June 2020 World Bank Management pause the next Doing Business Report 
<br/>and  undertook  a  serious  of  reviews  and  audits  in  its  methodology.  In  addition  because 
<br/>internal reports raised ethical matters including the conduct or former board officials as 
<br/>well as current and or former bank staff, management reported the allegations to the banks 
<br/>appropriate internal accountability mechanisms.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After reviewing all the information available to date on Doing Business including the findings 
<br/>of  past  reviews,  audits  and  reports,  the  bank  released  today  on  behalf  of  the  Board  of  Executive 
<br/>Directors that had it taken the decision to discontinue the Doing Business Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir this particular issue and on how it was flawed was raised time and time again 
<br/>in  this  House,  we  (the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade, 
<br/>Tourism) are continuously raised this with World Bank just to tell them how the process was flawed.  
<br/>And today it does not exist anymore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji as one of the 192 country surveys raised this matter of data irregularities.  
<br/></span><span>The data biasness which was significantly affecting the results of the survey with the World Bank 
<br/>Group.  It was pointed out with respect to Fiji that the survey respondents were people who benefitted 
<br/>from  providing  incorrect  information.  They  benefitted  from  providing  false  information  on  the 
<br/>reforms that were evident and were made public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  respondents  to  their  survey  chosen  by  the  World  Bank  was  narrow  and  excluded  the 
<br/>relevant  agencies  that  were  being  evaluated.  So  if  it  was  matter  of  relating  to  the  registering  of 
<br/>companies, the Registrar General was excluded, Mr. Speaker, Sir, even for the provision of neutral 
<br/>statistics.  The World Bank Survey Team actually gravitated towards critics of Government who had 
<br/>a vested interest in labelling Fiji a hard place to do business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Doing Business Survey was a disservice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to Small Island Developing 
<br/>States (SIDS).   Countries that were committed to reforms (just like us) and once the SIDS, like Fiji 
<br/>started identifying gaps in the data and the report to ensure that reforms reported were adequately 
<br/>captured,  the  World  Bank  Doing  Business  Team  no  longer  could  hide  behind  their  so-called 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objectivity. We had started discussions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, directly with the World Bank Group and 
<br/>we are working also with the reform team at the World Bank, more specifically with indicator-based 
<br/>technical teams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the Doing Business Report became so important, it became evident 
<br/>that the reforms that were done were not actually being reflected adequately.  Cabinet gave a mandate 
<br/>to the Ministry to ensure that the 2025 Doing Business Report, Fiji be ranked in the top 50.  Cabinet 
<br/>remained adamant, Sir, that the reforms must not only be done for mere ranking, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>Reforms are there to make things happen easier and faster and they are there to modernise the way 
<br/>Government  works  and  they  are  to  ensure  that  we  remain  competitive  in  the  global  arena  for 
<br/>investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019 major reforms were implemented in terms of starting a business 
<br/>and the ease of starting a business process.  Relevant agencies that were led by MCTTT provided 
<br/>data and all the relevant information and evidence to the World Bank to support the objective of the 
<br/>reform in a survey.  Then the survey was filled by the selected private sector mainly the so-called 
<br/>agents of investors.  There were people who benefited from delays, and guess what, the reforms did 
<br/>not get acknowledged at all.  It is indeed sad that one of the policies of the survey was that it gave 
<br/></span><span>precedence to information submitted by agents over the submissions made by the relevant agencies, 
<br/></span><span>even when the data and evidence was provided by these agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of these reforms included the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<div><span>launch of bizFiji portal for doing business in Fiji;  
<br/>elimination of business licences;  
<br/>streamlining of starting a business process and risk based approach with respect to low risk 
<br/>businesses having to have six months to obtain the necessary licences;  
<br/>reduction in time taken for processing by approval agencies, such as NFA and FNPF; 
<br/>digitalisation  of  application  processes  for  registrar  of  companies  and  Fiji  Revenue  and 
<br/>Customs Service;  
<br/>fast-track  process  for  construction  permit  for  industrial,  commercial  projects  through 
<br/>Building Permits Evaluation Committee;  
<br/>elimination  of  stamp  duty  requirement  while  registering  properties;  getting  electricity 
<br/>reduction and done by EFL;  
<br/>refund of capital contribution for commercial and industrial customers; 
<br/>the establishment of personal property security’s registry;  
<br/>taxpayer online portal; and  
<br/>investment facilitation taskforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry with the support of the investment related agencies continued 
<br/>reforms in 2020-2021.  Memorandums were submitted for the survey inclusive of both reforms and 
<br/>data correction.  The Ministry had also insisted on meetings with three critical indicator assessment 
<br/>teams and provided them direct submission, whilst also filling out these particular surveys.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In February 2021, we received a reform memo from the World Bank Group Doing Business 
<br/>Team informing Fiji’s reforms in three indicators namely: starting a business; getting construction 
<br/>permits; and getting credit, will be acknowledged in the 2021 Doing Business Report.  Something no 
<br/>other government has ever achieved.  So the Opposition wants to verify this, you can go over the 
<br/>Doing  Business  Reports.    This  would  have  meant  at  least  a  10-ranking  improvement  for  Fiji.    It 
<br/>definitely would have shut down the arguments that were presented earlier by honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad specifically.  Unfortunately, the World Bank Group decided to discontinue the Report, instead

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>589 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to sort out these issues.  So, for the first time, accedes would have been recognised amongst the top 
<br/>10 or 20 reformers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  want  to  tell  the  House  that  our  reform  journey  quite  categorically  state  this,  our  reform 
<br/>journey continues with extra vigour and strength.  We are working with some of the best technical 
<br/>advisors from Singapore and again also from the World Bank and IFC.  The Fijian Government will 
<br/>continue to roll out reforms that will benefit our people.  In a matter of months, we will roll out the 
<br/>launching of online starting a business platform on the bizFiji portal and for MSMEs we are working 
<br/>on the registration platform that is simple and easy, and we are working with the Ministry of Justice 
<br/>and World Bank on the insolvency legal framework for MSMEs, construction permit processes will 
<br/>also be brought online by the end of 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Complementary  to  these  reforms,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  also  spearheading 
<br/>investment related legislative and regulatory reforms where we have seen the establishment of a new 
<br/>Investment Act and review of the Investment Fiji Act.  This will also contribute towards modernising 
<br/>the Fijian business climate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  it  comes  to  providing  the  best  for  Fijian  business,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/></span><span>Government will do so.  No Doing Business Report will undermine the vision of the Government and 
<br/></span><span>we are paving the way for Fiji’s economic recovery and we will achieve what we are actually setting 
<br/>out to do.

<div><span>Livestock Farmers – Fencing Kits 
<br/>(Question No. 27/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment update 
<br/>Parliament on how many livestock farmers have received the fencing kits as announced 
<br/>in December 2021? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Member for asking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to earlier on a number of times what we want to do also earlier 
<br/>this week. What we want to do is, we want to expand livestock production, one to serve the demand 
<br/>from within.  For example, as highlighted earlier on, 99 per cent of lamb meat is imported.  So, we 
<br/></span><span>are promoting sheep raising as well as goat which we see as to some degree a perfect substitute.  We 
<br/></span><span>got the land, weather condition and the skill-sets that are required by famers to raise this livestock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also beef cattle, there is substantial amount of demand, also demand from the region. We are 
<br/>looking at expanding this but to expand this, Mr. Speaker, we need to migrate farmers (the small 
<br/>holder subsistence farmers) by providing them with fencing material. It is not possible to tether these 
<br/>animals when they are larger in umber than five or six.  So we have decided that we will establish 
<br/>these small holder farmers, subsistence farmers and assist them so that we can have large commercial 
<br/>farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that in mind, this year we are assisting one of the largest number of farmers with fencing 
<br/>material.  This  year we are targeting 567 farmers to  be receiving  fencing  material. With regard to 
<br/>livestock type: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Beef farmers – 259;  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Sheep farmers – 139; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="100">Page 100</a></div>
<div><span>590 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Goat farmers – 196.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to Divisions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Northern – 229; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Western – 256; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Central – 72; and 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Eastern – 10. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will go a long way in establishing more commercially-oriented farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  you  know,  not  only  we  will  be  saving  a  lot  of  money  and  also  we  will  be  expanding 
<br/>farmers and there is a lot of implication on household welfare, livelihood, national income growth 
<br/>and reduction in the money that goes out of the country in terms of import substitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These livestock that are held by farmers are also treated as cash reserve.  So, any particular 
<br/>point in time they need some cash, they are able to pull out one or two livestock and liquidate it.  It 
<br/>is very important. Of course, there is the cultural aspect as well which also plays a very important 
<br/>role in livestock rearing by farmers in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for beef cattle farmers, our officers now are getting these farmers to sign an 
<br/>agreement. We do not want to just keep the fencing material and get away from there and then later 
<br/>we find that these farms did not survive.  So, there are certain conditions they need adhere to so that 
<br/>these farms do survive and are commercial in nature.  We are in the process of getting this delivered, 
<br/>probably in the next four weeks’ time, it will be delivered in the Western and Central Divisions as 
<br/>well.

<div><span>Fiji’s Financial System 
<br/>(Question No. 28/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>soundness of Fiji’s financial system? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not going to labour this particular 
<br/></span><span>question in terms of my answer but I think, given the type of misunderstanding and ignorance shown 
<br/>by the other side, I think I will have to give the full detail on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Parliament should be aware that the financial system is made up of a number of sectors 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Banking sector or banking industry consisting of licenced banks, credit institutions and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Development Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Superannuation industry which in Fiji is the Fiji National Provident Fund as the lone player 
<br/>but considered the largest single financial institution in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Insurance  industry  consisting  of  licensed  insurance  companies,  intermediaries  which 
<br/>includes agents and brokers. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>591 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Capital  markets  industry  consisting  of  the  South  Pacific  Stock  Exchange,  manage 
<br/>investment  scheme,  Unit  Trust,  stock  brokers  and  licensed  investment  advising  their 
<br/>representatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreign  exchange  industry  consisting  of  licensed  foreign  exchange  dealers  or  money 
<br/>transfer operators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Credit information reporting industry consisting of the licenced credit information reporting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agency PT Limited and all its registered members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Payments systems industry of western legislation which was recently passed by Parliament 
<br/>and ongoing work is being undertaken to implement the relevant regulatory framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of the sectors we have just mentioned are supervised by the Reserve 
<br/>Bank of Fiji under the various laws that the Central Bank administers.  In terms of size as at December 
<br/>2021, the Fijian Financial System continues to be dominated by the banking industry making up 48.2 
<br/>per  cent  of  the  total  assets  of  the  financial  system  of  $25.4  billion  followed  by  the  Fiji  National 
<br/>Provident Fund at 33.4 per cent.  The insurance industry at 8.7 per cent with other sectors combined 
<br/>except for the payment system industry consisting of less than 10 per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is therefore important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the soundness of the Fijian Financial System 
<br/>relies significantly on the safety and sustainability of the three sectors that make up more than 90 per 
<br/>cent  of  the  financial  system,  that  is  the  banking  industry,  the  superannuation  industry  and  the 
<br/>insurance  industry  with  the  banking  superannuation  industries  consisting  of  entities  that  are 
<br/>considered systematically important financial institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I delve into some key assessments supporting the soundness of the 
<br/>Fijian  financial  system,  we  wish  to  highlight  that  the  maintenance  of  a  safe  and  sound  financial 
<br/>system is directly linked to the RBF’s objectives under section 4(c) of the Reserve Bank of Fiji which 
<br/>is to promote a sound financial structure.  One of the two core mandates of the Central Bank which 
<br/>is to maintain financial stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is financial stability?  The RBF defines it as the “the ability of the financial system to 
<br/>adequately fulfil its key economic functions of efficient allocation of financial resources and effective 
<br/>mitigation of risks through the provision of a well-functioning structure at all times.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the big picture, our economy has been through what we can only describe 
<br/>as roughest patch in our history, subsequently given the direct relationship it has with the real sector.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our financial system has faced its fair share of shocks which we expect will continue 
<br/>to be managed in the years to come.  In however seeking to effectively mitigate the impact of COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic and ensuring continued prudent operations with relevant strategies for a sustained way 
<br/>forward,  we  can  confirm  that  the  Fijian  financial  system  remains  safe  and  sound  and  financial 
<br/>stability continues to be enjoyed in Fiji at this point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The regulatory framework they provide for the supervision of the financial system continues 
<br/>to ensure that public trust and confidence in the financial system is well placed so that all licensed 
<br/>entities,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  continue  to  deliver  the  service  effectively  meeting  stakeholder 
<br/>expectations.  Licensed institutions are all able to meet regulatory requirements even during trying 
<br/>times such as now, riding on the strength of the balance sheets and risk management practises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="102">Page 102</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that we are in the third year of the pandemic, we see that this level of 
<br/>resilience and preparedness has served the financial institutions and consequently general public as 
<br/>well, further strengthening the overall stability of the financial system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is critical at this time as the nation looks to regain lost economic ground, efforts of which 
<br/>the financial system will be a key player.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we had stated earlier, the different 
<br/>sectors of the financial system particularly the systematically important ones have performed well 
<br/>before during and now in the later stage of the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We expect them to continue to do so going forward.  Licensed banks and credit institutions 
<br/>remain  well  capitalised  and  have  continued  to  adequately  perform  their  core  functions  of  funds 
<br/>intermediation.  As at 31st December, 2021, capital adequacy as a key soundness indicator for the 
<br/>banking industry stood at 20.9 per cent against the minimum requirement of 12 per cent for banks, 
<br/>and 29.1 per cent for credit institutions against the minimum requirement of 15 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Credit  risk,  however,  has  been  on  an  increasing  trend  as  expected  due  to  the  impact  of 
<br/>COVID-19  with  the  ratio  on  non-performing  loans  to  total  loans  increasing  from  3  per  cent  in 
<br/>December, 2019 (before the pandemic) to 7 per cent in December 2021 for banks and respectively 
<br/></span><span>for credit institutions from 14.5 per cent to 13.2 per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are talking about people defaulting on their loans and not being able to pay at all.  The 
<br/>elevated level of credit risk continues to be mitigated by provisions that has been set aside as well as 
<br/>capital adequacy buffers to ensure that any materialising of credit risk is minimised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, relief has also been provided on a case by case basis to those who  were 
<br/>either  directly  or  indirectly  impacted  by  COVID-19  pandemic  through  loan  repayment  holidays 
<br/>which as at the end of December 2021 stood at 13.8 per cent of the industry’s total loan book value 
<br/>of $997.800 million.  For comparison at its peak, loans on repayment holidays stood at $2.8 billion.  
<br/>With the downward trend, a reflection of the initiation economic recovery as loan customers are able 
<br/>to again secure income sources to pay for their loans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should be noted that repayment holiday assistance is expected 
<br/>to conclude by the end of March 2022.  The banking system continues to be fully liquid with interest 
<br/>rates now at relatively low levels.  As the economy recovers, the current low interest rate environment 
<br/>is expected to spur demand for credit and subsequently the effective allocation of financial resources 
<br/>with appropriate controls, thus underscoring financial stability in the medium to long term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FNPF remains solvent and continues to meet its legislated objectives, with the Fund able 
<br/>to  announce  a  similar  level  of  actuarial  assessed  return  to  its  members  even  in  the  midst  of  the 
<br/>pandemic. Liquidity is at a level that supports the Fund’s ability to continue to meet its obligations 
<br/>to members and indeed pensioners, while investment returns are positive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  FNPF  sustainability  has  continued  to  be  confirmed  with  its  meeting  of  the  legislated 
<br/>solvency requirement, even during the institution’s extensive efforts to provide relief assistance to 
<br/>members in the aftermath of natural disasters and during the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  insurance  industry  has  remained  operationally  resilient  even  during  the  pandemic 
<br/>reporting more than adequate levels of solvency surplus.  Solvency requirements under the Insurance 
<br/>Act 1998 were met more than 17.9 times by the life insurance sector and more than 4.8 times by the 
<br/>general insurance sector as at September 2021.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gross premiums earned by the industry has  continued to  grow indicative of the continued 
<br/>business  placed  with  licensee  insurance.    All  licensed  insurance  companies  were  in  profitable, 
<br/>supporting the capacity to pay claims as they fall due.  All other sectors in the financial system have 
<br/>effectively remained operational, rising to the call to serve Fijians especially during the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the process, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a significant trend was observed in all financial institutions 
<br/>taking serious efforts to move to technological platforms as a means of business continuity during 
<br/>COVID-19.  By strategically implementing digital solutions such as automation, mobile solution and 
<br/>remote network security systems, licensed financial institutions have tried to be better positioned to 
<br/>handle a wide array of working conditions whether the office, in the field or indeed working from 
<br/>home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The credit reporting industries making progress to fill the gap and ensuring fair reporting of 
<br/>credit supports the effort by lending institutions to ensure quality credit is provided, which in turn 
<br/>support the soundness of the financial system.  A number of entities have registered with their licence, 
<br/>Credit Information Reporting Agency PTE. Limited and we expect more credit information to be 
<br/>reported and shared in the next 12 months.  Ongoing work is being undertaken by relevant agencies 
<br/>of  Government,  and  the  private  sector  to  finalise  the  legislative  framework  for  the  regulation  of 
<br/></span><span>payment systems in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  another  significant  development  for  financial  stability  as  a  rapid 
<br/>involvement of FINTEC and e-Commerce has overhaul the structure of our financial system.  We 
<br/>therefore expect the widening of the RBF supervisory ambit to capture mobile network and payment 
<br/>system operators to ensure a safe environment for Fijians to undertake financial transactions online 
<br/>and through mobile phones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  wish  to  reiterate  that  the  Fijian  financial  system  remains  sound  and 
<br/>stable.  In the face of the most significant economic shock that Fiji has encountered, our licensed 
<br/>financial institutions have proven to be resilient and have continued to operate in a prudent manner.  
<br/>Our  financial  system  has  remained  relevant,  operationally  strong  and  innovative  as  appropriate. 
<br/>Going forward we expect the financial system to play a key role in our economic recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notwithstanding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I have just said, risk to financial stability remains.  
<br/>This can be initiated by the failure of one institution or a group of licensed entities. Supervision in an 
<br/>institutional level and surveillance at the system level is on-going by the RBF. Closer monitoring of 
<br/>these risks will continue and corrective measures will be implemented as deemed suitable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, lastly monetary policy and financial stability are very much interlinked.  By 
<br/>ensuring that monetary policy objectives of foreign reserves and inflation are intact, the RBF was 
<br/>able to implement a commendation monetary policy which has resulted in a reduction in interest rates 
<br/>in the markets.  As we all know, Sir, interest rate is a fixed cost and any chances of any businesses 
<br/>surviving is higher when the interest rates are low.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the first major crisis where interest rate has not risen to double digit 
<br/>but as actually but has actually fallen, thereby assisting private businesses to survive which in turn 
<br/>has helped in ensuring that financial institutions remains sound.  I would like to acknowledge the 
<br/>work done by the Governor of the RBF and his team, the Permanent Secretary for Economy and also 
<br/>our  Head  of  Treasury  and  all  the  other  team  members  that  have  actually  ensured  that  behind  the 
<br/>scene, a lot of work has been done to ensure that our financial system remains very sound.
