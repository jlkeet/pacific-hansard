<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, firstly I would like to wish our honourable Prime Minister a quick recovery so 
<br/>he can return healthier and stronger to continue to lead our beloved country.  Let us continue to pray 
<br/>to our Lord to bestow His healing on our Prime Minister and restore him to full health.  Mr. Speaker,

<br/>Matakibau Emosi Molo, Matakibau Manasa and Matakibau Sekove.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, furthermore I would like to thank all the members of the Tailevu South branches 
<br/>and all their respective committee members.  I would also like to thank the party agents, observers, 
<br/>poll  agents  and  all  those  that  volunteered  to  assist  the  team  during  the  day  of  voting.    To  all  the 
<br/>families and relatives who stood and backed me all the way in 2018, I appreciate and thank you all.  
<br/>My maternal family, the Kaloumaira from Uluibau, I thank them for always being there for me.  To 
<br/>my Seniloli family of Naua, Bau, thank you for the unwavering support and encouragement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have always been fascinated by this august House and all that it entails.  The 
<br/>fascination began when I was an undergraduate student in the early 90s.  At that time my late father 
<br/>was Fiji’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations.  I, at times listened to the speeches of the 
<br/>representative at the UN.  My interest was further enhanced when my late father again was elected 
<br/>into Fiji’s Parliament after his stint in New York.  These lifted my aspirations to follow in my late 
<br/>father’s footsteps - to serve the people, to work hard, to believe in myself, to be financially prudent 
<br/>and not to be wasteful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my parents were hardworking and committed secondary school teachers and 
<br/>taught in a number of secondary schools in Fiji, and contributed to the building of human capital in 
<br/>Fiji.  Building human capital is very important for our country today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our education system needs to respond to the challenges of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century, especially now 
<br/>with COVID. We need to improve online learning at all levels of education.  Teachers and students 
<br/>need training this year in this area and online learning must have the supporting infrastructure.  Today 
<br/>and  with  COVID  work  is  rapidly  moving  to  online  services,  automation  and  digitisation.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this is the new normal we must keep up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  addition  we  must  continue  to  empower  people  with  continuing  education 
<br/>such  as  that  provided  by  the  universities  and  Australia  Pacific  Training  Coalition  (APTC).    This 
<br/>system of education of giving people a second opportunity must be supported.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, today I have put up my hand as part of SODELPA Party and the Opposition. I 
<br/>put my hand up to do what we are here for and that is to ask questions and to hold the Government 
<br/>accountable.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, honourable Lynda Tabuya, 
<br/>a  respected  lawyer  and  an  advocate  for  youth  issues  and  labour  rights.    This  august  House  will 
<br/>remember her oratory skills as she defends the rule of law, scrutinising of new Bills and most

<div><span>Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>291 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importantly as a representative of the people by asking the pertinent questions. I do sincerely wish 
<br/>Ms. Lynda Tabuya my </span><span>marama naita</span><span> all the best in her new endeavour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in 2018, my inspiration to stand in the election was an opportunity to serve the 
<br/>communities and villagers whereby I can make a difference in trying to breach the disparity between 
<br/>urban and rural development. Urban bias exist. Urban bias as the development of urban areas at the 
<br/>expense of rural areas thus the rural communities are at times deprived for much needed development 
<br/>as it is being in the urban centres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  urban  bias  has  now  contributed  to  a  deeper  and  disturbing  economic  divide 
<br/>where people in the rural areas are getting poorer compared to people in the urban areas.  The urban 
<br/>rural economic gap is real.  It is real and it is growing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2019-2020 Household Income and Expenditure Survey is a testament to this whereby 
<br/>reported that 42 per cent of the rural communities are poor and with 62 per cent of the total poor 
<br/>population.  Therefore there is a real need to invest in our rural communities to ensure an equitable 
<br/>provisioning of resources so that all the people of Fiji can have equal access to much needed human 
<br/>basic rights services regardless of where they might live. This includes clean water for all, quality 
<br/></span><span>education for all, regular supply of electricity to all, quality health services for all, reliable transport 
<br/></span><span>and  communication  services  for  all.  These  can  be  achieved  when  we  have  a  strong  broad  based 
<br/>economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak on COVID which is still around and here.  Firstly may I 
<br/>express my heartfelt condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones during the COVID and 
<br/>the Omicron variant pandemic. To all the families of Fiji please do know that we feel and grieve with 
<br/>you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I would also like to recognise and acknowledge the enormous work and sacrifice of our 
<br/>first responders in protecting our borders, attending to the sick, resolving contact tracing, conducting 
<br/>screening and vaccination and securing our border containment areas.  I praise and am grateful to the 
<br/>members  of  the  medical  profession,  Fiji  Police  Force,  Republic  of  Fiji  Military  Forces,  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service, civil servants with the volunteers and NGOs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  acknowledged  the  enormous  effort  by  our  frontliners.    Let  us 
<br/>lighten their work by being vaccinated.  I salute the many people who are being fully vaccinated and 
<br/>I encourage those who have not had their booster shots to have it, for their own safety.  To those who 
<br/></span><span>have not been inoculated at all, to do this for yourselves, for your loved ones and for your country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this point, I would like to thank the people of Tailevu South, again, for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>putting me here, and I will strive to serve you and all the people of Fiji to the best of my ability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is at this juncture, I wish to highlight the importance of having an electoral system with 
<br/>multiple constituencies instead of the one which we have.  Constituencies connect us, the elected 
<br/>representatives,  directly  to  members  of  the  constituency.    We  know  their  needs,  we  know  their 
<br/>strength, their struggles, and it allows us to be accountable to the people who have elected us.  In 
<br/>addition, the election battle would be easier to manage and more relatable to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This current system is unfair as it allows the candidates with small number of votes to be 
<br/>elected  to  Parliament,  riding  on  very  few  popular  candidates  and  making  the  decisions  for  our 
<br/>country.  This needs to change.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for his maiden speech.  I now invite the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Howard Politini to deliver his maiden speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H.R.T. POLITINI.-  Mr. Speaker, the honourable Acting Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and 
<br/>members of the public who are watching this live telecast; good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is,  indeed,  a  great  honour and privilege to  take my place in  this august Parliament as a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member.  First and foremost, I thank our Sovereign God for this favour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With these few months ahead before the National Election, I am still in a position to serve 
<br/>my fellow Fijians and to be able to assist and to lead them to more fruitful and satisfying lives in 
<br/>carrying out what the Government has done for the past seven years of leadership.  As a philosopher 
<br/>Richard J. Daley said, and I quote, “Good government is good politics.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  this  note,  I  wish  to  convey  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Voreqe  Bainimarama 
<br/>strength  and  positive  thoughts  on  his  recovery,  and  wishing  his  wife  Mary,  children  and 
<br/>grandchildren our thoughts and prayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the island Kingdom of Tonga, to my families, friends and loved ones, our thoughts and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prayers are with you during this trying time on the recent tragedy of the volcanic eruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  congratulations  to  the  </span><span>Turaga  i  Taukei  Bolatagane,  na  Tui  Macuata</span><span>,  Ratu  Wiliame 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Katonivere as he ascends the high office as the youngest President of our beloved island of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to also thank my family; my wife, Unaisi, and her family; my 
<br/>sister; Lani, and her family; my parents, especially my dad, Kamoe, watching this live telecast in 
<br/>Rotuma; to my good friends,  Lawrence, Alrick and Shalini; and to Googan, Max, Myron, Manav 
<br/>and Monica in Auckland, New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Namata, Nadroga; Malamala, Yako, Namulomulo, Tovatova, Pakistan in the 
<br/>high reaches of the Nausori Highlands and Bangladesh in Navakai; </span><span>vinaka</span><span>.  In the Yasawa, na </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>na Tui Drola</span><span> of Nacula Village, </span><span>vinaka saka vakalevu na veiciqomi</span><span>; the village of Vuaki, Naisisili, 
<br/>Matacawalevu, and the Doughty family of Tavewa Island and Navotua.  In Tavua, villages of Nadelei 
<br/>and Nasomo; the settlement of Lomalagi in Vatukoula, Nabuna and Korovou.  </span><span>Ena yasana of Ra, na 
<br/>koro o</span><span> (In the Province of Ra, the village of) Naseyani, Nananu, Togovere and Barotu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on COP26, I thank the honourable Prime Minister, Voreqe Bainimarama, 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General and Minister  responsible for climate change, honourable Aiyaz-
<br/>Sayed Khaiyum, and the team of our Fijian delegation for their successful negotiation in voicing our 
<br/>concern to the world on climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On COVID-19, the people of Fiji suffered in this pandemic in every way, from families, our 
<br/>children’s education, business and, yes, all over the world. With the good leadership of the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government to vaccinate, it has now come up to over 90 per cent of the adult population from 18 
<br/>years and above, who are fully vaccinated, whilst ages 12 years to 18 years’ vaccination campaign is 
<br/>underway by our Ministry of Health Team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji stands united by patriotism.  A journey of struggles and of</span><span> </span><span>triumphs has emerged us as a 
<br/>powerful Pacific Island Nation. Together, we have done great things.  It has been a challenging two 
<br/>years for many of us but we will persevere through challenges - our journey to embrace the new norm

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and to take heed of necessary COVID-19 precautionary measures. We continue to spread kindness 
<br/>and look after each other.  Our voters deserve better, a continuation of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On education, Mr. Speaker, during my boarding school days in Tailevu in the early 1990s 
<br/>under the leadership of the Rabuka Government, there was no such thing as ‘free education’, as we 
<br/>hear  Rabuka  ranting  in  the  media  today  that  he  started  free  education.    I  remember  back  then, 
<br/>busloads of mostly my fellow students who were sadly sent home because they could not afford their 
<br/>school fees. This could have been Rabuka’s interpretation of so-called ‘free school fees’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on infrastructure, I would like to highlight my involvement for the past three 
<br/>years  in  civil  construction  works  on  bridges,  roads,  low  level  crossings,  footpaths  and  industrial 
<br/>subdivisions. On behalf of all civil contractors, crews on the ground from our labourers, surveyors, 
<br/>site engineers and project managers, I would like to convey a big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to the honourable 
<br/>Minister for the Economy and Acting Prime Minister, and the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, 
<br/>Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources, that despite capital projects slowing down 
<br/>by the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), maintenance projects were ongoing, even during the onset of 
<br/>COVID-19 from 2020 till to date.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  commercial  front,  we  have  noted  the  Australian  Giant 
<br/></span><span>communication network – Telstra, buying Digicel Pacific. This only shows a positive indicator of 
<br/>foreign investor’s confidence in our local economy, as the Australian High Commissioner quoted as 
<br/>saying, “Telstra will be here in a big way”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji as a regional hub  in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), a website 
<br/>has been launched for many global companies as Fiji is reliable and has low-cost communications 
<br/>services, along with its geographic proximity to two major cities in Australia.  All this has only been 
<br/>possible because of the vision of the FijiFirst Government in putting in place the building blocks of 
<br/>a sophisticated and attractive ITC sector.  This has meant economic diversification and 100,000 jobs 
<br/>in  the  next  decade.  Our  young  Fijians  will  benefit  from  the  FijiFirst  Government’s  sound  and 
<br/>consistent policy making.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to conclude, I wish to, again, thank all those who have supported and trusted 
<br/>me to enter this august Parliament.  I must make special mention of our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy for giving me the opportunity to be 
<br/>part of the 2014 and 2018 General Elections under FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May our Sovereign God continue to journey with the FijiFirst Government for the remainder 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of this parliamentary term and beyond. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>.
