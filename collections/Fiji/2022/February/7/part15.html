<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK 2019 ANNUAL REPORT   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its 
<br/>Review  of  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  2019  Annual  Report  in  August  2021  and  commended  the 
<br/>overall performance of the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), as well as acknowledged their contribution 
<br/>towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FDB plays a pivotal role towards Fiji’s economic development.  This was evident in its 
<br/>2019 Report as the bank’s lending portfolio grew from $539.75 million at the end of the financial 
<br/></span><span>year  with  the  loan  portfolio  representing  a  customer  base  of  5,149  accounts.  The  Committee 
<br/></span><span>welcomed and commended recent initiatives and services, namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yaubula Term Deposit Facility; 
<br/>FDB Agriculture Loan Facility; 
<br/>Strategic Partnership in FDB; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Agriculture and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); and 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Matching  Grant  Support  Scheme  for  SMEs,  to  promote  market-oriented  agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>production for farmers in remote and rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee extended its appreciation to the team at FDB for successfully executing its 
<br/>accreditation with the Green Climate Fund.  This milestone brings potential for the bank to increase 
<br/>foreign investment in local climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee was very pleased to note that the FDB dedicated a section of its 
<br/>report to include its progress towards achieving the SDG relevant to them.  Such initiatives strongly 
<br/>reaffirms the bank’s commitment towards fulfilling its goal.  The Bnk also plays an important role 
<br/>towards  increasing  financial  knowledge  through  the  financial  literacy  initiatives  as  well  as  its 
<br/></span><span>community-based expositions and roadshows.  This was evident through the outreach programme 
<br/></span><span>conducted during the period under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee had concluded its  report by stating the bank must continue to  enhance its 
<br/>service delivery and must vigorously invest in research and development initiatives to maintain the 
<br/>competitive edge in the banking sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope you can see me from there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Very clearly, I can hear you as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I was kind of surprised when I walked in this morning to find 
<br/>that we were relegated from the front seat to the back seat.  I was kind of wondering, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>that probably you and the Government want to hide us away from the front but I can tell you Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker,  you will still  be able to hear me and the Government will still be able to hear me.

<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>325 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- The Leader of the Opposition decides who sits where.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Leader of the Opposition did not make the decision.  Get 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your facts right! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the only thing they have, to discuss that. Let me, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, also say that this morning there was this despicable, shameful attack by honourable Koya 
<br/>and honourable Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum on the Auditor-General. Let me tell them, let me tell them … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No amount, no amount of attack on the Auditor-General … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my motion for debate was that the Parliament debates 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Review of Fiji Development Bank 2019 Annual Report.  Please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Member should not waste Parliament’s time, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I was saying that no amount of attack by both the honourable Members on the 
<br/>Auditor-General  is  going  to  hide  the  fact  about  their  poor  and  disastrous  economic  and  financial 
<br/>management in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Coming  back  on  the  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  see  that 
<br/>honourable Vijay Nath talked about the Bank’s lending portfolio growing to $539.75 million at the 
<br/>end of the financial year with the loan portfolio representing a customer base of 5,149 accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On page 6 of the 2019 Annual Report, Mr. Speaker, it shows a breakdown of this portfolio 
<br/>figure which talks about the non-focus sector and the value is listed as $305.75 million and the focus 
<br/>sector is $234 million.  So, Mr. Speaker, the increase from 2018 to 2019 for the non-focus sector was 
<br/>$39.68 million whereas the difference for the focus sector was only $13.02 million.  So, indeed the 
<br/>Bank’s portfolio grew but not for the sectors that FDB should be focusing on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  does  not  highlight  that  because  when  you  turn  to  page  39,  the  report 
<br/>highlights that there is 2008 realignment classified sectors into focus and non-focus sectors meant 
<br/>that most closely aligned with the bank’s mission and vision is the focus sector.  The sector that FBD 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>326 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be focusing on but is only doing so by a number of loans not the actual value.  The non-focus 
<br/>sector comprises investment opportunities that are essentially commercial, corporate and essential 
<br/>for the long-term sustainability of the bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, it is important to look at that particular information and relate that to the 
<br/>overall Government policy in terms of growing the economy. And what we have seen is a complete 
<br/>opposite of what has been happening in terms of the economic management in this country.  And I 
<br/>want to highlight this, Mr. Speaker and this recent report which came out in November 2021, Fiji 
<br/>country  classification  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  should  be  a  sober  reading  for  all  the 
<br/>honourable Members on the Government side because what this Report shows, Mr. Speaker, that 
<br/>well before COVID-19 we had forgotten about the real direction of the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We did not focus on the real sectors of the economy and FDB’s statistics shows that the Bank 
<br/>did not concentrate on the focus sector.  So, we had poor economic management, poor economic 
<br/>policies, poor debt management, modest foreign direct investments and narrow base of the economy.  
<br/>The Report talks about the narrow base of the economy and this is what we have been saying, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in this Parliament for the last seven years.  Here is a Government which spent seven 
<br/>years borrowing and spending on sectors which did not allow us to grow as the real economy.  Look 
<br/></span><span>at the sugar industry, look at the dairy industry, look at the forestry industry and look at the overall 
<br/></span><span>agriculture sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Agriculture is trying very hard these days, and I would like to 
<br/>commend him, at least he has brought back the focus.  But imagine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the FDB had 
<br/>focused where their priority should have been, if Government had focused on the agriculture sector, 
<br/>if it had not destroyed the sugar industry, if we were still producing three million tonnes of cane, if 
<br/>we were still having the dairy industry that we used to have, Mr. Speaker, today, after the onslaught 
<br/>of COVID-19 pandemic on this country, we would not be in this kind of economic rummage that we 
<br/>have seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just read one or two paragraphs in this Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   In fact, the FDB 
<br/>figures show that the growth rate between 2010 and 2020 average only 3.5 per cent.  We used to hear 
<br/>this big song and dance about unprecedented growth and then we had this Bainimarama boom.  Look 
<br/>at 2015, let me give you another statistics.  From 2015 to 2019, the average growth rate was only 3.1 
<br/>per cent, the so called Bainimarama boom that they were talking about.  So, it is a modest growth 
<br/>based on unrelented borrowing and …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Well,  that  is  the  only  word  he  knows,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>“hogwash”, and  I remember in the last session, while hogwashing, he meandered to Rwanda and 
<br/>Solomon Islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, the fact is a bitter truth for them.  The fact of the matter is 
<br/>that between 2015 and 2019, we had a modest growth of 3.1 per cent, a modest foreign investment, 
<br/>poverty  rate  increased  slightly  before  COVID-19  and  the  Bank  says  it  very  clearly.    Now,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir we have been downgraded from C to B.  It is not like an economic grade where from C 
<br/>to B is an improvement.  This shows that we are now a blended country classification, and in fact the 
<br/>Bank points  out  in this Report, they should all read this, that we were at  the risk of debt distress 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>327 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before the COVID-19 pandemic onslaught on this country.  The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why we 
<br/>are in this situation today is the type of example that you see coming from the FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me talk about this $200 million FDB COVID-19 Recovery Credit Guarantee Scheme, 
<br/>and I want to raise some questions here.  I hope that honourable Koya, I am sure he will speak on 
<br/>this, should be able to answer.  This $200 million COVID-19 Recovery Guarantee Scheme, in my 
<br/>view, given FDB’s mandate should have been on the focus sector.  The question I want to ask because 
<br/>there are so many people who have come to us and sent us the letters from the FDB which gives them 
<br/>no reason why their loans were declined, and people are also telling me that those who applied in the 
<br/>first instance, they have all got whatever they applied for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also told, Mr. Speaker, and I stand to be corrected and I want the honourable Minister to 
<br/>answer  this  question,  that  many  of  those  who  applied  for  that  loan  in  the  first  instance  were 
<br/>companies, businesses which had arrears with the bank even before the COVID pandemic.  Now 
<br/>what does that mean? My question is, did the bank use this opportunity in dishing out these loans to 
<br/>those who had arrears before the COVID pandemic to actually clear its book on arrears? I have had 
<br/>so many calls and letters like this have been sent to me about why the bank is not giving the reason. 
<br/>It is absolutely important, in fact, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the Government, have an immediate 
<br/></span><span>audit, ask for an immediate audit of what transpired.  What were the kind of businesses who got the 
<br/></span><span>support? Why did so many who were affected by the pandemic?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had this young businessman from Lautoka (I do not want to name him here), he has been 
<br/>writing. He wrote to the honourable Attorney-General, I do not know whether he wrote to honourable 
<br/>Koya because he has not been given any reason why his loan was declined and his business was only 
<br/>affected after COVID-19.  There were many other examples, Mr. Speaker, so maybe we should have 
<br/>an immediate audit because it is important for us to keep the bank focussed on the real sectors of the 
<br/>economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know recently the honourable Minister for Agriculture in the press conference the other day 
<br/>emphasised about another scheme with the FDB is going to implement but it is important that they 
<br/>remain on the focus sector.  It begs a bigger question, Mr. Speaker, and this is what I have said before 
<br/>that there are some good initiatives that Government comes up with. I can understand the objective 
<br/>and the idea but whether the implementation of those schemes are properly scrutinised and dealt with. 
<br/>This has been a problem with this Government that they have engaged in reckless borrowing and 
<br/>spending without making sure that we get the value for money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Old record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We must ask for value for money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, may I repeat this again in this Parliament, my estimate of the wastage under this 
<br/>Government from 2015-2020 which I have followed in terms of the budget and projects, many of 
<br/>them remain uncompleted like the FNU Campus, Lautoka Swimming Pool, et cetera.  My estimate 
<br/>is that on average about $500 million per year from 2015-2020 had been wastage through pilferage, 
<br/>mismanagement and lack of value for money that has been given to build infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you put that together, it amounts to about $3 billion in six years.  If this Government has 
<br/>any shame, any sense of accountability and transparency, let us have an audit, an independent inquiry 
<br/>into the expenditure from 2015 to 2020 because it is absolutely important. According to this Report, 
<br/>we are going to go through a very, very difficult time in this country even if we get back to normalcy 
<br/>in terms of tourism, it is going to take us years before we get back to pre-pandemic level, economic 
<br/>situation and economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we must make sure that the accountability that is required from the Government 
<br/>on everything possible is adhered to and made in a transparent and accountable manner.  This loud 
<br/>mouthing of hogwash from the other side is not going to take away the truth of the matter. This is a 
<br/>constant threat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  remember  the  same  Minister  who  is  talking  about  hogwash  was  trying  to 
<br/>threaten the people of this country with Rwanda and Solomon Islands.  He must get his facts right 
<br/>and there are people out there who are only talking about Rabuka.  These are people who do not talk 
<br/>about people who were sitting with them from 1987. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were sitting with them from 1987, they were part of the 
<br/>game.  So, instead of talking about the real issues which is where FDB should be going, where we 
<br/>should be going in terms of our policies for real economic sectors, these guys are trying to “hogwash” 
<br/>to use his term to frighten the people.  They are already going, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  One Minister in Ba, 
<br/>I  am  told  went  to  a  temple  and  said,  “Do  not  leave  this  Government  because  if  you  leave  this 
<br/>government you will be in trouble.” They are threatening people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  They  are  threatening  people,  instead  of  talking  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  instead  of  getting  hold  of  a  copy  of  this 
<br/>Report  and  reading  about  their  Minister’s  economic  management,  their  Government’s  economic 
<br/>management and all the cheer leaders from the other side must read this Report.  They must read this 
<br/>Report because then, they will find what the state of the economic mismanagement in this country 
<br/>is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by saying that we need an immediate audit of the $200 
<br/>million  COVID-19  Recovery  Credit  Grant  Scheme  to  ensure  that  our  future  schemes  by  the  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Development  Bank  remains  focused  on  those  priority  sectors.    The  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span><span>Agriculture is correct that the commercial banks are not willing to give loans to the farmers easily, 
<br/>those in the agriculture sector.  Let us refocus FDB back to the real sector of the agriculture sector 
<br/>and put our money where our mouth is instead of bragging about how good our economic policies 
<br/>have been.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in contrast to honourable Prof. Biman Prasad, I 
<br/>join  the  Committee  members  -  honourable  Vijay  Nath,  honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar,  honourable 
<br/>George Vegnathan, honourable Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau in commending 
<br/>the overall performance of the Fiji Development Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was the FDB which dealt with the issue in a 
<br/>financial market of what we call “Loan Pushing”.  Loan Pushing is a phenomenon which refers to 
<br/>when a small group of financial institutions with substantial market power use their lending to raise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interest rates in a particular sector.  Had it not been for the FDB, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would have 
<br/>had great problem in financially resourcing investors, commercial entrepreneurs in the agriculture 
<br/>sector.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, numbers testify to that.  Of the overall lending to the agriculture sector in 
<br/>2019, $7 billion, one per cent went to agriculture sector from the commercial banks; only one per 
<br/>cent.  It is the FDB which has been the hope for investors in the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of all  the formal institutions and informal institutions which we can list 
<br/>down which has contributed to the growth and development of the agriculture sector, FDB stands 
<br/>tall.  Majority of FDB’s lending is to the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  time,  FDB  has  looked  at  the  agriculture  sector  and  re-tweaked  its 
<br/>products to meet the requirements of the agriculture investors.  When one talks about the volume of 
<br/>lending  in  the  Agriculture  Sector  and  uses  that  to  say  that  lending  should  have  been  more,  my 
<br/>question is, what should be the benchmark? First of all, it is easy to say that lending by FDB of $107 
<br/>million in 2019 was not sufficient, there should have been more lending.  My first question is, what 
<br/>should be the amount then that they should have lent?  My second question is do they have an estimate 
<br/>of the demand for financial resources?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  go  and  read  any  financial  lending  literature,  they  talk  about  a 
<br/></span><span>borrowings  ladder  where  in  small  developing  countries  in  agrarian  societies,  when  people  need 
<br/>finance, first of all, they will use their finance. Then they will move to their close family members.  
<br/>Then they will move to relatives.  So, getting loan from a financial institution (bank) is the last resort 
<br/>they tend to go.  They generally tend to shy away from borrowing from the financial sector.  In any 
<br/>developing country, any agrarian society, you will see that farmers and small and medium enterprises, 
<br/>generally tend to shy away from borrowing from a financial institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a problem of farmers moving towards borrowing for their 
<br/>financial requirement from commercial banks or lending financial institutions.  For that, Sir, this year 
<br/>the Ministry of Economy has allocated $0.5 million for a first time ever special programme called, 
<br/>Commercial  Farmers  Equity  where  any  farmer  who  would  want  to  borrow  from  the  FDB, 
<br/>Government through the Ministry of Agriculture will provide them 20 per cent equity contribution 
<br/>as grant.  I must commend the leadership of the new CEO, Mr. Saud Minam, who is working very 
<br/>closely with them and a lot of activities are now happening.  Wherever the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>is organising meetings and consultations with farmers, we have now and FDB Official also presenting 
<br/>their products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we now have over time, looking at the needs of the farmers.  
<br/></span><span>The FDB has come up with new products to meet the status of the farmer.  There are farmers in this 
<br/>country who do not have a formal title, but they are undertaking agriculture and no commercial bank 
<br/>would want to lend to them, but FDB is lending to them.  New products have come up over time, and 
<br/>one of them is the Agriculture Family Loan Facility Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are farmers who would want to borrow but they do not have any equity contribution.  
<br/>The FDB is loaning to them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So under the Agriculture Family Loan facility, FDB 
<br/>is supporting family farms.  There is agriculture value chain financing from the farm to the market 
<br/>in the component of the agriculture value chain.  They could get finance for them from FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  got  the  FDB  Development  Loan  Programme  that  supports  farmers  who  have 
<br/>demonstrated experience in farming.  There is a package that they offer only for land purchase, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  Sometimes, commercial banks will say, “Look, if you purchase a land, we want to see 
<br/>immediately your returns”, but it takes time for returns, particularly when you are into livestock or 
<br/>tree crop farming. So, there is a special loan package for that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are packages designed for specific commodities, for example, rice farming and bee 
<br/>farming, because these are different kinds of enterprises.  Their financial in-flow would be different 
<br/>and, therefore, normal commercial banks would not want to lend to them because they would not 
<br/>want their repayment to get stuck.  So, for development banks which is totally focussed on really 
<br/>partnering and developing the agriculture sector, these are the kind of products that we would want 
<br/>to see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, I joined the Committee in saying that we must motivate the 
<br/>FDB for the enormous amount of work that they are doing.  It is this partnership that have resulted 
<br/>in agriculture, for the first time ever in 2020, surpassing sugar exports by $5 million.  In 2020, sugar 
<br/>export earnings was $100 million, non-sugar agricultural exports was $106 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture was seen only in terms of feeding the entire country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have dual focus of the agriculture sector where: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we feed the entire country, service the requirements of demand from the tourism sector 
<br/>and other hospitality component; and 
<br/>equally, we are putting emphasis on investing on those areas which are totally marketed 
<br/></span><span>towards export markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  in  the  Ministry,  we  are  establishing  these  key  high-value  export  commodities, 
<br/>appointing team leaders of this and totally targeting how we could assist them, ring-fence them and 
<br/>also get them to work with FDB so that we can develop and take advantage of this export market and 
<br/>have a good brand imagine of our products, for example, kava, ginger, turmeric,  </span><span>duruka</span><span>, assorted 
<br/>vegetables in Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we still are not able to fulfil the demand for most of these commodities.  We 
<br/>need  to  be  positive  and  optimistic  and  we  need  to  support  the  institutions  that  are  supporting 
<br/>agriculture rather than running them down without any factual evidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I want to commend the Committee for their Report and I want to 
<br/>commend the work that FDB is doing, particularly now, and the Ministry looks forward to work with 
<br/>them. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  allowing  me  to  make  a  short 
<br/>contribution on the motion before the House.  First, I want to thank the Committee for tabling its 
<br/></span><span>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have just heard the honourable Minister for Agriculture mention that we were satisfied 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the overall performance of the FDB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- The Report says. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes, that is right.  We were satisfied with the overall performance 
<br/>of    FDB,  but  that  does  not  mean  that  FDB  did  very  well  -  exceptionally  well  in  their  role  as  an 
<br/>autonomous institution to provide finance in the agriculture sector, commercial sector and industrial 
<br/>sector.  It does not mean that they did well.  No, there are areas that need to be rectified by FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for too long, we have taken for granted that FDB was doing well on its role 
<br/>as clarified in  the  Fiji  Development  Bank Act.   I just want  to read the information  that  confirms 
<br/>FDB’s role and its position in the development of our economy, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Fiji Development  Bank works with the mission, in accordance with FDB 
<br/>Act,  to  provide  finance,  financial  and  advisory  services  to  assist  in  the  economic 
<br/>development of Fiji, and in particular in the development of Agriculture, Commerce and 
<br/>Industry. It is an autonomous statutory body, the operations of which are controlled by 
<br/>the Board of Directors appointed by the Minister of Economy.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the position of FDB. Its role is to provide financial assistance for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agriculture development, industry and commercial development.  That is fine.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to draw your attention to Recommendation No. 2 of the Report, and it says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Committee acknowledges that the focussed sector portfolio is more closely 
<br/>aligned to the Bank’s Mission and Vision. The focused sector accounts comprise 79.55% 
<br/>of the FDB portfolio worth $234m which represents an increase of $13.02m whilst the 
<br/>non-focussed  sector  comprised  20.45%  of  the  FDB  portfolio  worth  $305.75m.    The 
<br/>Committee  recommends  that  the  Bank  continues  to  enhance  improvements  to  the 
<br/>focussed sectors contribution in value to the Bank’s total portfolio.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  the  Committee  recommends  to  enhance  and  to  do  more,  meaning  that  the  Bank  was  not 
<br/></span><span>performing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will share with you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how I measure the performance of FDB.  Let us look 
<br/>at the market share of agriculture.  In 2015, agriculture represented 47 per cent of the market share; 
<br/>in 2017, it still remained at 47 per cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The portfolio, not a market share. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Market share of 47 per cent, you check your facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who lend the other 53 per cent?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- It is here, which is the market share in the Annual Report.  It is here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- But, who lend the other 53 per cent?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Well, that is my question.  That is what I am trying to drive at.  A 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bank that gets the support of the Government … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out the conversation between you two.  Address the Chair.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- He is interrupting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The agriculture market share remains stagnant over the years.  Look at 2018, it is 58 per cent, 
<br/>although it has a slight increase.  Back in 2019, look at the agriculture market share.  It reduced to 53 
<br/>per cent, he has not even read that report.  So, what is he doing?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This also applies to all the resource-based Ministries, like the Ministry of Trade, Ministry of 
<br/>Fisheries and the Ministry of Forestry.  They all are the same.  There is not enough growth to impact 
<br/>our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport just mentioned that 
<br/>they managed to improve the standard of living.  Look at this ADB Report, Fiji country classification.  
<br/>In 2017, the trend started to  go down until  2019.  So what  are they talking about?  Where is  the 
<br/>growth?  Where is that economic boom they are talking about?  How can we improve the standard 
<br/>of living when the economy is going down?  They cannot even increase the $2.68 an hour minimum 
<br/>wage rate, which they promised to do in 2018, and that is the measure that we need to see to confirm 
<br/>whether we are having an economic growth or economic boom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at our hospitals, it is right beside the honourable Minister for Health.  He knows very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well that our hospitals and health centres are in a mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Talk about FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- This is the impact of FDB, the development of economic sectors, 
<br/></span><span>because there is no development and no improvement in the performance of providing finance to the 
<br/></span><span>relevant Ministry, and that is why we are all having these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at the road conditions, it is the worst since Independence.  You go down the Queen’s 
<br/>Highway, you pass Korolevu, go down to Sigatoka, potholes are everywhere.  You go to Nadi, you 
<br/>go past Namotomoto Village, Navoci Village, Nakavu Village and Saunaka Village, and that is the 
<br/>impact of FDB that it is supposed to be doing.  That is what I am saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  even  though  the  FDB  was  doing  well,  it  was  not  enough.    All  those 
<br/>honourable Ministers are not doing their jobs.  I do not believe any of them has analysed this to know 
<br/>that  they  are  not  doing  their  jobs.    If  I  was  the  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  I  would  have  sacked  the 
<br/>Honourable Minister for Economy for appointing Boards that are not doing their jobs, I would sack 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Agriculture, I would sack the honourable Minister for Trade, and sorry, 
<br/>my senior old boy, I will have to sack you too for non-performance, Sir.  They have been sleeping 
<br/>on the job with a high salary and doing nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to say something and I think you might 
<br/>appreciate this. What comes across from the other side of the House, especially from the last two 
<br/></span><span>speakers from the Opposition and I am saying firstly the honourable Professor Prasad and honourable 
<br/></span><span>Kuridrani, I think they have this philosophy in their head which is called the scattergun philosophy.  
<br/>They have a whole load of bullets and you shoot anywhere you want and maybe, just maybe, Sir, just 
<br/>maybe it might stick but for them what happens is, it does not stick, Sir, and that philosophy does not 
<br/>work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Just for a moment, Sir, I am not even sure if honourable Professor Prasad actually read the 
<br/>2019 Annual Report. I am sure he did not because there is so much good stuff in here that it was not 
<br/>just this side of the House that signed off and then said it was a good thing, it was the other side of 
<br/>the House and then suddenly he has done a turncoat and decided to say something else.  It is always 
<br/>the case, Sir, as I have said, scattergun philosophy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am actually flabbergasted at the comments made by honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad.  He spoke a little while ago and he said there is no growth, there is no stability in our economy, 
<br/>there is no literally everything.  And I want to point something out to him, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I 
<br/>am sure the honourable Minister for Economy …..

<div><span>333 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You see this is what happens.  When you start talking, it hurts him. I 
<br/>have not even said anything yet.  It already hurts him.  Sir, all they do is they have this doom and 
<br/>gloom prediction.  Let me ask him a very pertinent question, Sir.  Seven-and-a-half years, I have been 
<br/>in this House, Mr. Speaker, not one budget did this man ever come up with an alternative budget. 
<br/>Not once! Not once!  Somebody outside of this House who has not even been in this House, he has 
<br/>… well kudos to him but this gentleman who has been here eight years, Sir, has never come up with 
<br/>one iota of document to say this is an alternative budget.   Never! Never and he still comes here, 
<br/>prophesises about all of these things and all he ever says is doom and gloom but what he fails to 
<br/>forget and these are simple things that the people of Fiji will realise, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  He talks about 
<br/>economic problems that we are facing.  He says, where is the growth?  There is no growth.  Let me 
<br/>remind him and I am not going to say this in the way the Minister for Economy will because that is 
<br/>his portfolio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  we  all  see  in  Fiji  is  we  have  actually  had  growth.    We  have  had 
<br/></span><span>unprecedented growth which is actually nine years and because of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a 
<br/></span><span>small country that lives in the Pacific Ocean, we have become one of the most respected countries in 
<br/>the Pacific Ocean because of our sound economic policies and because of that we have had people 
<br/>falling  at  the  economy  door  wanting  to  lend  money  to  us.  I  am  sure  they  would  not  do  it  if  our 
<br/>economic policies were bad, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is the whole reality of it, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had direct budget funding which we have never had, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  All of this 
<br/>is because we have got sound economic policies.  We have had growth right up to the pandemic and 
<br/>even during the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not run the economy into the ground.  We have 
<br/>actually managed it really well.  We have continued to pay our civil servants in full.  Nobody in Fiji 
<br/>is suffering the way they make it out to suffer.  It is not the truth.  That is definitely not the truth and 
<br/>he knows that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to say one small thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he said, “Oh we have forgotten about 
<br/>the sugar industry, FDB has done nothing.”  The FDB gave the sugar industry an uplift in the tune of 
<br/>$20 million in 2019.  Go and read this and read it carefully.  Do not ever come back and say that I 
<br/>should and go and question something because I read this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the  Committee on Economic Affairs for its assessment on 
<br/></span><span>the  2019  Report  and  I  want  to  thank  the  Opposition  Members  who  have  actually  supported  it.  
<br/>Basically  and  I  want  to  also  congratulate  the  FDB  board  and  management  for  producing  an 
<br/>unqualified audit report for 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, in a nutshell, what he fails to realise again is that, this means that FDB’s financial 
<br/>statements  were  prepared  in  a  true  and  fair  manner  according  to  the  accounting  principles  and 
<br/>standards and from my perspective, Sir, from the Ministry’s perspective, being the bank for micro, 
<br/>small and medium enterprises and grassroots community, it actually gives me great pride and joy to 
<br/>know that a Fijian institution, our bank is financially sound Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wanted  to  comment  also,  specifically  on 
<br/>recommendation five on the Standing Committee’s Report and that recommendation five states that 
<br/>the Committee is aware of the important role played by SMEs towards Fiji’s economic growth and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommends the FDB to work with stakeholders such as MCTTT to develop lucrative packages to 
<br/>attract more youth to invest in modern agriculture through initiatives and YES.   And I just wanted 
<br/>to also point out something else too honourable Professor Prasad and this is with respect to MSMEs 
<br/>and he says, ‘oh, what are we doing, somebody called him and said I have not received my loan,’ 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, and he is talking about somebody from Lautoka.  Maybe, maybe, just maybe he should 
<br/>actually check.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of people, their loans were rejected just like any other loan in any 
<br/>other bank was rejected because they had bad loans in other institutions, so not everybody was going 
<br/>to get it.  I think everybody understands that. That is a simple banking principle.  The one that he is 
<br/>talking about, the one that he quotes from Lautoka, my home city, that applicant had loan in arrears 
<br/>in another institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Is he saying? What is he saying? Is he saying that we should 
<br/>lend it to bad applicants?  Banks do not do that, Sir.  It is actually quite simple.  Is he trying to say 
<br/>that we should turn the FDB into National Bank of Fiji (NBF) and turn it into a national disaster? 
<br/>That is what he is trying to say, is not it?  And let me remind the people of Fiji, do not be fooled, do 
<br/>not be fooled, absolutely do not be fooled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They know better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  from  the  Ministry’s  perspective,  I  can  confirm  that  the 
<br/>Ministry has and will continue to partner with the FDB on the various programmes with respect to 
<br/>MSMEs and one another important part of our economy is the co-operatives and FDB in partnership 
<br/>with the Department of Co-operatives has actually provided support to sugarcane farmers unlike what 
<br/>he just said, who have actually formed co-operatives and financing to mechanise and modernise their 
<br/>farms.  So, I do not where, he says get your facts correct. Your facts are incorrect.  This is the correct 
<br/>facts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The co-operatives have used the funding and purchased cane harvesters and other machinery 
<br/>for these farms and this actual model has worked well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  These farmers are able to 
<br/>harvest their sugarcane and also give it on hire to other farmers.  There is additional income for these 
<br/>particular  co-operatives  and  our  co-operatives,  they  are  doing  extremely  well.    We  have  also 
<br/>partnered them with the FDB in terms of our micro and small grants for disbursements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After that particular disbursement Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FDB now has 40,000 Micro and Small 
<br/></span><span>Business Grant (MSBG) people on the FDB database.  That is a phenomenal database and what has 
<br/></span><span>happened since is some of those or  quite a few of those MSBG recipients have been able to access 
<br/>further  finance  through  the  FDB  after  becoming  part  of  the  database  and  this  is  an  indication  of 
<br/>MSMEs graduating their business and thinking of a long-term sustainable future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  also  partnered  on  our  Northern  Development  Programme  and  FDB  provides  the 
<br/>equity funding to successful applicants who were then able to obtain loans through FDB and there 
<br/>have been major beneficiaries in this particular programme.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019 we 
<br/>supported close to  120 recipients  in  paying out  more than  $0.5 million and this has been another 
<br/>successful programme for MSMEs in the North.  We have included FDB through the CEO in all our 
<br/>activities.  They form a part of our Board and our grant programmes, the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Young Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES) Programme,  
<br/>National Export Strategy (NES) Programme,  
<br/>Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRB),  and 
<br/>Northern Development Programme (NDP) programmes.

<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>335 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you can see, Mr. Speaker, the FDB has and is an integral part of our continual work including the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture particularly in providing access to finance for MSMEs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want this august House to realise that many of these recipients, who were 
<br/>part of the Recovery Credit Guarantee Scheme, who were adversely affected by a natural disaster 
<br/>and the COVID-19 pandemic and the FijiFirst Government was not oblivious to this and this is why 
<br/>the Ministry through several other programmes is working closely with FDB to find avenues to assist 
<br/>Fijians to get back on their feet.  We are going to FDB also, as we all know, Sir, is  going through a 
<br/>transformational  stage  where  they  are  redefining  their  strategies  and  it  is  focused  on  two  main 
<br/>segments, that is agriculture and MSMEs which are the core to FDB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been said time and time again, Sir, by the Opposition that by moving Government, we 
<br/>are actually moving Government services to a digital platform, we are leaving those in the regional 
<br/>maritime areas and MSMEs behind. We are not, Sir.  It is interesting to know that FDB only provides 
<br/>their  services  through  digital  channels  and  their  customers  being  the  MSMEs  mainly  from  the 
<br/>regional and maritime areas.  So, they have embraced it well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The FDB like the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government continues to challenge the status quo and remain ahead of its time.   I thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the time to contribute.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the FDB.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  we  would  like  to  clarify  that  yes  we  are  Members  of  the  Committee  and  we  do  have  an 
<br/>understanding of how the Committee works. We work together within.  But at the same time, there 
<br/>is nothing in the Standing Committee which prevents us from also contributing at this stage when the 
<br/>report comes to the House.  We do contribute in various ways and raise issues as we see from our 
<br/>perspective as Opposition Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report itself, Sir, I would like to reiterate the issue raised by the honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad regarding the focal and non-focal sectors that is clearly pointed out on page 39.  And let me 
<br/>read out  the  FDB Act, section 5  – ‘The  functions of the Bank shall be to facilitate and stimulate 
<br/>development,  promotion  of  natural  resources,  et  cetera,  transportation.  In  the  discharge  of  its 
<br/>functions, the Bank shall give special consideration and priority to the economic development of the 
<br/>rural and agricultural sectors of the economy of Fiji’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  why  if  you  look  at  the  recommendations,  that  is  what  we  are  pointing  out  in 
<br/>recommendation  two  -  the  focal  and  non-focal  sectors  and  the  need  for  the  focus  sectors  to  be 
<br/>improved or enhanced and if you look at page 39 there, as mentioned by one of the previous speakers, 
<br/></span><span>let me just read it out - ‘The focus sector accounts comprise 79.55 per cent of the FDB portfolio and 
<br/></span><span>43.35 per cent by value of the 4,096 accounts worth $234.00 million as compared to the non-focus 
<br/>sector which is on the same page, 20.45 per cent of portfolio but 56.65 per cent of the value’, so that 
<br/>is the fundamental crux of the matter which we are raising and which is also pointed out there in 
<br/>recommendation two and in line with FDB Act, section 5 which is why the recommendation is there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the concerns, as you note there, notable contributions in the non-focus sector are in 
<br/>wholesale, retail and hotels.  And I raise at this point, Sir, the Pullman Resort, one of the reports from 
<br/>August, 2020 regarding the collapse of the Pullman Nadi Bay Resort.  It states that it was a bold 
<br/>venture  from  the  developers,  Travel  World  Resorts  Limited,  a  subsidiary  of  Gokal  Group  of 
<br/>Companies in support of Government’s drive for tourism. Gokals started with good intentions, the 
<br/>Pullman  brand  belongs  to  Accor  Hotels  and  they  manage  the  resort  for  Gokals,  but  inside  are 
<br/>suggesting three contributing factors to the current situations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Location  –  Pullman  Nadi  Bay  Resort  and  Spa,  five  star  hotel  was  built  in  the  budget 
<br/>accommodation hub, Wailoaloa Beach area.  There are a number of well-established such

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operations as Aquarius, Smugglers Cove, Blue Water Lodge, Beachside Resort, et cetera 
<br/>which are also operating there and Pullman Nadi Bay guests were able to stroll there to eat 
<br/>and  drink  at  budget  established  prices.    It  is  good  for  tourists  but  bad  for  investors  in 
<br/>expensive facilities in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Cost overruns regarding this Resort – they had a lot of complications in the construction 
<br/>which led to cost overruns.  It was a big development with quite a significant budget of 
<br/>initial $80 million but had cost overruns in the construction that caused financial pain.  Of 
<br/>course, the downturn in the economy - COVID-19.  The primary financers were FDB and 
<br/>HFC Bank and FDB advertised the mortgage and sale on this and I suppose the good news 
<br/>on this was that there is a report from November 2021 which indicates that there is a buyer 
<br/>or a buyer has been identified and bought already.  That is the good thing about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  whether  FDB  lost  out,  that  is  something  which  is  not  available  but  some 
<br/>questions which we can raise regarding this is, was the assessment done properly in terms 
<br/>of net cash flow, net operating income and revenue per available room.  I mentioned the 
<br/>location,  capitalisation  rate,  debt  yield,  total  cost  basis,  business  plan  including  various 
<br/>projections and of course risk analysis and mitigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, that is related to the issue raised on the focus and non-focal.  I am pleased to say that 
<br/>the CEO has indicated that they might not be funding big projects like this currently or in the near 
<br/>future.  There is also a major development which occurred during the period of this Report that is 
<br/>highlighted in page 70 titled “Green Banking” and this was regarding the approval of FDB, not only 
<br/>as an accredited Green Climate Fund (GCF) institution, but they also approve the US $5million Fiji 
<br/>Agrophotovoltaic Project in Ovalau.  Again this is a major development and unfortunately, maybe it 
<br/>has been affected by COVID-19 and it would be interesting to determine the status of this project to 
<br/>date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  issues  I  would  like  to  raise  from  here  Sir,  is  one  of  the  key  offices  in  the 
<br/>accreditation of FDB has accredited institution of the Green Climate Fund was one of the key offices 
<br/>in that development in the compliance processes and development was Mr. Cakacaka.  Unfortunately, 
<br/>he is not with the Bank now, he has been Acting CEO for quite a number of years, a senior officer 
<br/>there  and  I  was  wondering  what  the  succession  planning  is  within  the  Bank.    That  is  an  area  of 
<br/>concern which we had raised not questioning the abilities or the experience of the current CEO, but 
<br/>the succession planning within where they could identify and  nurture our local staff to reach the 
<br/>CEO level.  Maybe that is another are which we need to focus on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  issue  which  had  been  raised  during  this  period  was  the  management  of  Micro 
<br/>Enterprises Grant by FDB.  I think this a one-off but the feedback from the Bank was it took up a bit 
<br/>of their time in terms of space, et cetera.  It is indicated there in page 114 as at 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2019, $1.538 
<br/>million were yet to be disbursed and thus payable to Government.  These funds are payable at call as 
<br/>it is only provided by the Government to be distributed by way of grant to Small Micro Enterprises 
<br/>meeting certain criteria.  I understand that this has been fully distributed, some of the questions we 
<br/>could raise, the monitoring and evaluation in place, who is monitoring these SMEs, how effective 
<br/>was this, how many successes or failures and what is the status of these projects from 2020 to 2022?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue just to raise again today is from the Audit Report on Government Commercial 
<br/>Companies, again mentioning FDB. One of this relates to conflict of interest, so, if you look at Page 
<br/>122, loans amounting to $2.7 million, it states and I quote, “… were advanced to a company where 
<br/>a  Director  had  a  related  party  interest  and  are  included  in  loans  and  advances.    The  loans  were 
<br/>provided under normal terms and conditions.”  So there is a case of conflict of interest mentioned 
<br/>there.  This again is mentioned in the Audit Report 2019 but under FDB Nominees Limited, it states 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I quote: “The Directors of the Nominees who were employees of FDB agreed to invest $279,000 
<br/>in term deposits offered by FDB.  We note that the Directors did not abstain from participating in the 
<br/>decision making to invest in FDB.  In addition, conflict of interest was not declared and documented.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendation there was to strengthen good governance.  Directors must declare any 
<br/>conflict  of  interest  that  arise  in  the  course  of  business  operations  and  exclude  themselves  from 
<br/>decisions relating to the conflict of interest.  It also raises the issue of independent Board Member, 
<br/>stating that for good governance, it is imperative that Board composition should be balanced with at 
<br/>least  30  per  cent  to  be  independent  and  non-executive  Directors;  the  company  agreed  with  the 
<br/>recommendation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, on governance and oversight function, the Bank is governed by a Board appointed 
<br/>by  the  Minister  under  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  Act.      It  is  not  required  to  comply  with  the 
<br/>provisions  of  the  Public Enterprise  Act  2019  and  Companies  Act  2015.  In  addition  there  are  no 
<br/>formal arrangements for the banks to  be supervised by the Reserve  Bank of Fiji.   So, there is  an 
<br/>agreement to work towards aligning the bank operations with the requirements of RBF, probably that 
<br/>has been progressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the issues I thought I would raise today, Sir, and again I reiterate regarding the role 
<br/></span><span>of FDB. We do understand the importance of FDB to the economy and the role it plays and I would 
<br/>like to raise some of the issues which had been raised by this side of the House regarding the ADB 
<br/>Report.  There has been a long debate about the economy and the honourable Attorney-General has 
<br/>mentioned that this side of the House has been spreading </span><span>lasulasu</span><span> and </span><span>jhooth. </span><span> It is interesting because 
<br/>we also think that you are </span><span>lasulasu</span><span> and </span><span>jhooth.  </span><span> But  I think when we are arguing that way, it would 
<br/>be  good  to  look  at  independent  reports  as  mentioned  by  honourable  Professor  Prasad  which  has 
<br/>clearly stated some of the issues on public debt, the national income, the poverty rate and it is clearly 
<br/>stated there the status we are in.  I am not sure what the honourable Minister for Economy is basing 
<br/>his assessment on including that this year we will have about 11 per cent growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just on the debt, if you look at the average debt to GDP under Rabuka from 1992 to 1998 it 
<br/>was  24  per  cent,  Qarase  was  29  per  cent,  Bainimarama  from  2006  to  2019  was  44  per  cent  and 
<br/>Bainimarama, again, from 2020 to 2021 was 78 per cent, and it is going onto 90 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- So again, Sir, what I would like to reiterate is, sure you can call 
<br/></span><span>us </span><span>jhooth </span><span>and </span><span>lasulasu</span><span> and we will call you that, but the only ratification for that are international 
<br/></span><span>reports and this is provided by ADB for the population to make their conclusion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.K.  BHATNAGAR.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  make  a  short  contribution  to  the 
<br/>motion  on  the  floor.    First  of  all,  I  wish  to  commend  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB)  as  they 
<br/>continue to introduce innovative products to empower Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2019, farmers who had previously lacked access to finance due to the 
<br/>absence  of  a  formal  land  title  to  put  forth  as  collateral  to  obtain  loans  from  banks  can  now  take 
<br/>advantage of the one of its kind FDB - agriculture family loan facility.  The facility is an innovative 
<br/>and tailor made financial solution that provides access to finance to those farming for 10 years or 
<br/>more and who do not have a formal land title.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In breaking the barrier to accessing finance, this facility focuses on the growth of farming 
<br/>families  by  providing  finance  for  land  development  on  the  farm,  construction  of  farm  house  and 
<br/>infrastructure such as farming roads, water supply and irrigation or renewable energy to support the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farm.  This product has benefitted many farming families, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and FDB is commended 
<br/>for their great work in empowering our farmers.  I urge farmers to take opportunities created for them 
<br/>and progress in their ventures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture’s genuine contribution and assistance towards our farmers.  The honourable Minister and 
<br/>his  Ministry  have  been  at  the  forefront  of  empowering  our  farmers,  their  valuable  support  and 
<br/>successful partnerships with industry stakeholders, such as FDB, indeed is commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a statement made last month by the honourable Acting Prime Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we learnt that, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Despite  everything  the  pandemic  threw  at  our  farmers,  we  exported  more  in 
<br/>agriculture produce in 2020 than any year of Fijian history, crossing the hundred million 
<br/>mark in fresh and cheap produce for the first time in history.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a remarkable testimony of not only the resilience of our farmers, but 
<br/>this  also  speaks  volumes  about  the  successful  mechanisms  put  in  place  by  the  Government  and 
<br/></span><span>relevant stakeholders in providing a strong and stable support system for our farmers, of which the 
<br/></span><span>FDB  is  a  major  partner.    I  congratulate  all  farmers  and  industry  stakeholders  for  this  splendid 
<br/>achievement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  it  was  also  pleasing  to  note  that  the  Bank  significantly 
<br/>expanded  its  portfolio through  extensive  outreach  programmes  to  its  customers  and  by  providing 
<br/>innovative business solutions and products.  Financial literacy is such an important tool and the fact 
<br/>that  it  remained  a  key  strategic  focus  for  the  Bank  is  very  encouraging,  especially  through 
<br/>programmes such as </span><span>Money Smart</span><span> series introduced by the Bank to inculcate a savingS culture in 
<br/>children.  I would like to take this time to congratulate the Bank for executing its accreditation with 
<br/>the  Green  Climate  Fund  in  2018  as  this  major  milestone  will  allow  the  Bank  to  increase  foreign 
<br/>investment in local climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.  Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I urge farmers to take opportunities created for them to progress in their ventures and I wish FDB 
<br/>well.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a few points to clarify, I would like to 
<br/>thank the Committee for the Report.  A number of issues have been raised on the floor of Parliament 
<br/>regarding the FDB Report, but of course, as usual, there has been a digression into other areas of the 
<br/></span><span>economy.  Let me put to rest that the figures that had been quoted by honourable Professor Prasad, I 
<br/></span><span>did not have the pleasure of listening to his entire speech, but some may perhaps, it was a good thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  heard  honourable  Tuisawau.  The  reality  of  the  matter  is  that  the  debt 
<br/>figures, he quoted the ADB Report - ADB did not question the economic projections that we have 
<br/>said  it publicly;  the ADB Report did  not  question the nine  years of  growth  and the ADB did  not 
<br/>question the debt figures.  None of that is the Report.  In fact, as we did similarly with the World 
<br/>Bank,  we  have  highlighted  to  the  ADB  for  a  number  of  years  that  Fiji  should  be  entitled  to 
<br/>concessional  loans  because  of  our  vulnerability  to  climate  change.    We  knocked  on  the  doors  of 
<br/>World Bank for about three to four years and they finally gave us concessional loan.  We have seen 
<br/>that this weather is wroughting upon us at the moment. Last week, there was flood. The FRA is telling 
<br/>us that there have been landslides, roads have actually been washed away, approaches to bridges have 
<br/>gone, crossings have gone and this is primarily because of climatic change.  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> wiped off 
<br/>one-third of the value of our GDP in 36 hours.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>339 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have had 13 cyclones since 2016.  Coupled with  the fact that we are a developing 
<br/>country, we were classified as a middle-income country.  Our argument with them is that, you cannot 
<br/>say to us, “You are not entitled to concessional financing because you are a middle-income country”, 
<br/>because we are the coalface of climate change, and climate change is not our doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our carbon footprint is almost negligible. It is the highly industrialised countries that have 
<br/>caused the rise in carbon. They are the ones that have caused climate change and, therefore, we at a 
<br/>very least should be entitled to concessional financing. That is what the Report is about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad,  Mr.  Wadan  Narsey,  Mr.  Richard  Naidu  and  Mr.  Savenaca 
<br/>Narube  have  all  jumped  on  this  bandwagon  and  are  essentially  trying  to  say,  “Well,  all  of  these 
<br/>figures show that the economy is not doing well.”  But none of the reports, ADB has not questioned 
<br/>the debt levels that we have stated.  They have not questioned that. Despite the fact that we provide 
<br/>clarification three or four days ago, we still have the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> giving prominence to these people 
<br/>printing  lies,  and  they  are  the  </span><span>lasulasu</span><span>.  We  can  back  what  we  say  with  facts  and  figures  - 
<br/>independently verified and published on the website, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, this is the type of shenanigan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is  taking place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  as  we  have  said  in  the  past,  for  political  ascendency,  they  will  try  and 
<br/>undermine our economy just so Government can look bad but in the process, they are undermining 
<br/>the economy. They are seeking to undermine confidence in investors, and a result of it, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I wish to say to the ordinary Fijians, that they are also trying to stop you from getting jobs, from 
<br/>increasing your livelihoods, from getting people out of unemployment, from making sure that young 
<br/>people - graduates who are looking for jobs, do not actually get jobs. That is what they are doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite incredulous. Honourable Kuridrani, as usual, went on his diatribe.  
<br/>But the fact of the matter is, they are equating and saying, “FDB is fantastic before.”  I can talk about 
<br/>EMCOL. What happened to EMCOL? What happened to all the other loans that were given? What 
<br/>happened to all the write-offs by FDB? They did not talk about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad is talking about someone in Lautoka, and as 
<br/>rightly pointed out earlier on, you cannot give loan just because you have this $200 million facility - 
<br/></span><span>a  question  which  I  will  answer  later  on  asked  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Just 
<br/></span><span>because you have a $200 million loan facility, it does not mean you give out loans willy-nilly. You 
<br/>do not give out loans willy-nilly, you need to be able to give it to people who you know they can pay 
<br/>or  they  need  a  helping  hand.    He  used  some  incident  from  Lautoka  to  justify  that.    Completely 
<br/>irresponsible, Mr. Speaker, Sir!   I think what he wants to do is for us to go down the NBF road.  So 
<br/>that was what happened in the NBF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- His piped piper who is following Rabuka, that is what he is 
<br/>doing.  Under Rabuka’s Prime Ministership, the National Bank of Fiji lost over $200 million.  He 
<br/>had what we called the good bank and the bad bank. The NBF was then sold off to Colonial.  I worked 
<br/>for Colonial, Mr. Speaker Sir, and I know what used to happen in the NBF.  Crop liens were given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>340 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by NBF, then Colonial stopped giving crop liens because they want to phase it out. So, where does 
<br/>the burden fall on?  Fiji Development Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have said in Parliament previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the fundamental reasons 
<br/>why agriculture has not reached large commercial proportions in this country is because of the laws 
<br/>we had previously where you can get lease terms for 99 years  - tourism, commercial, residential, 
<br/>industrial,  but  not  for  agriculture  which  is  30-year  lease,  for  political  reasons.  This  is  why  no 
<br/>commercial bank would lend and would use the land as collateral. Honourable Kuridrani, listen, you 
<br/>will learn!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is why no commercial bank would lend and use agriculture land as collateral.  This is 
<br/>why you do not have large scale mechanisation.  We have now sugarcane harvesters coming in, which 
<br/>the Government contributes and they get a loan from FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am personally involved with this landowning unit in Nadi where 
<br/>there is enormous collaboration, as the honourable Minister for Agriculture had highlighted, where 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Co-operatives,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade, 
<br/>Tourism and Transport and FDB are working together so that they can buy things like tractors, et 
<br/></span><span>cetera.  That is what is happening at the grassroots level, and they  are using their lease monies as 
<br/></span><span>their repayment, which is being used as collateral.  So, these are a lot of things that are taking place.  
<br/>However, that is one of the fundamental reasons why we do not have investment in the agriculture 
<br/>sector, and FDB is left to pick up the pieces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In here, they have the audacity to come and run-down FDB. Every year, since we have been 
<br/>presenting the Government Guarantee on FDB, they voted against it, and then they ask, why is FDB 
<br/>not doing anything good about it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This is the level of hypocrisy!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing that was quite interesting and, in fact, quite astonishing is 
<br/>that, they are comparing the growth in FDB’s agriculture portfolio with the overall economic growth, 
<br/>as if agriculture is the only sector that contributes to the economy.  Of course, there are other sectors 
<br/>- there is sugar, there is manufacturing, there is now ITC services, there is financial services, there is 
<br/>garment industry and there is tourism.  We have people in the Opposition saying, “Well, because this 
<br/></span><span>is the portfolio of agriculture, therefore, the economy must be doing favourably.”  That is such a 
<br/></span><span>fundamental illogical statement.  Any basic person who understands economics in high school will 
<br/>tell you that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to make is that, 
<br/>they  talked  about  the  non-focused  sectors.  Again,  a  lack  of  fundamental  understanding.    Non-
<br/>focussed sectors actually provide what we call, cross-subsidisation of interest rates.  So, when private 
<br/>companies borrow, they pay much higher interest rates - some of them pay 12 per cent, some 11 per 
<br/>cent.    What  do  the  farmers  pay?    Some  pay  3  per  cent,  4  per  cent,  some  even  lower  because 
<br/>Government subsidises it.  That is how FDB funds itself with the Government Guarantee.  They go 
<br/>out into the market and they raise funds.  It is not a commercial bank, they do not accept deposits to 
<br/>which they can then lend on to other people.  It  is a fundamental basic understanding of how the 
<br/>banking system works, and they do not mention that at all. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FDB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just very quickly, one other point that was highlighted was that the Bank’s 
<br/>total operating revenue recorded a growth of 5 per cent, while its main income stream interest income 
<br/>increased from $32 million in 2018 to $36 million in 2019.  That is a growth of 10 per cent, which is 
<br/>largely due to the growth in the Bank’s overall loan portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as at 30th June, 2021, the Bank’s total operating revenue recorded a growth 
<br/>of 24 per cent, when compared to the 2019 financial year and its main income stream interest income 
<br/>increased by 26 per cent in 2021 when compared to the 2019 financial year, which also attributed to 
<br/>the growth of the Bank’s overall loan portfolio.  The total asset base was recorded at $546 million, a 
<br/>17 per cent increase from 2018 financial year, while total liabilities also increased to $373 million, 
<br/>an increase of 21 per cent from the 2018 financial year.  Shareholders equity also increased slightly 
<br/>by 9 per cent to $172.3 million in 2019, from $158 million in the 2018 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FDB now, of course, has embarked on this huge digital platform.  We 
<br/>have people who borrow money of less than $5,000 and now the funds can actually be disbursed 
<br/>through MPAiSA and Money Wallet.  It is very easy for the farmers.  Most of the applications (not 
<br/>all of them), in fact, are done online.  A lot of the farmers can apply through that platform.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A number of initiatives have been put in place, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we would like to also 
<br/></span><span>acknowledge the work that has been done.  As the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways 
<br/>and Environment has said, we have seen a breath of fresh air, a commercial (sort of) nous that has 
<br/>now been injected into FDB through the new CEO, and we have seen that a lot more efficiency has 
<br/>been gained through this new type of management style. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FDB,  of  course,  plays  a  critical  role,  as  honourable  Bhatnagar  also 
<br/>highlighted.  For example, the Agrophotovoltaic Project in Bureta, Ovalau, will yield a lot for the 
<br/>people living in Bureta.  It will  not only provide electricity to the grid at Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) 
<br/>which has always struggled and they always use fossil fuels, but this would also provide renewable 
<br/>energy now, and at the same time provide agricultural opportunities for the people living in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  FDB  is  not  only  giving  directly  to  farmers  but  also  using  the  funding.    It  has  got 
<br/>accreditation now by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) of up to $10 million.  The FDB is now looking 
<br/>at accessing up to $50 million.  There are various loops you have to jump through to be able to qualify 
<br/>for that, so they have qualified for the first tranche of $10 million, and they are looking at $50 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge all honourable Members to, please, take a close read of 
<br/></span><span>the Report itself.  Of course, honourable Tuisawau highlighted some issues like Pullman, and I am 
<br/></span><span>happy to say that they have sold Pullman.  In fact, we were quite concerned because of COVID-19, 
<br/>you would think that they would get what we call a ‘firehouse sale’, but they have almost got what 
<br/>they wanted.  So, even in COVID times, they were able to get a good pricing for that and, of course, 
<br/>some of these things do go belly up sometimes.  This is normal part and parcel of the banks but, of 
<br/>course, if it becomes a routine thing, then it is problematic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we need to be able to ensure that there is a lot of prudence that is built into the system, 
<br/>and we can safely say that because we have got commercial experience now coming in, you will see 
<br/>a lot more robustness in the way that the Bank carries out its functions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Acting Prime Minister for his contribution to the debate.  I now 
<br/>give the floor to the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in Reply.

<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all those honourable Members who have put up
