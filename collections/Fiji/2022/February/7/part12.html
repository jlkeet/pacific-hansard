<h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3>
<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>NFP’s Recent Press Releases 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the honourable Speaker has not stifled debate on health or any other 
<br/></span><span>issues that political parties wish to bring to Parliament for debate.  The National Federation Party 
<br/>(NFP) should not be making such baseless claims which purport to bring disrepute to the Office of 
<br/>the Speaker and to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special Committee to Analyse, Assess and Report on the  
<br/>Effectiveness of the Ministry of Health’s Response to COVID-19 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua’s motion for Parliament to set up a special committee 
<br/>under  Standing  Order  129  to  analyse,  assess  and  report  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Health’s response to COVID-19, this is the response given to the NFP during the vetting of Questions 
<br/>and Motions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“These matters can be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs.  
<br/>There is  no need to  have a separate committee, given that there is  already  an existing 
<br/>mechanism in place.  There is no need for duplication. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the course of the Standing Committee’s inquiries, members of the Committee 
<br/></span><span>can ask questions and make inquiries of this nature.  This is very broad and is the same 
<br/></span><span>kind of tasks that Committees undertake when scrutinising these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, when the Business Committee rules out Questions and Motions, the 
<br/>Secretariat duly takes note and thereafter, implements these Rulings, in similar Questions 
<br/>and Motions  that are submitted, such as this motion.   Therefore, this motion  is  out  of 
<br/>order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members should take note that the Parliament Secretariat does not 
<br/>dictate what Members of Parliament can bring to the floor of Parliament.  The Parliament 
<br/>Secretariat’s role is to implement the provisions of the Standing Orders, as well as the 
<br/>decisions of the Business Committee.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Speaker has, on many occasions, ruled out of order such motions that propose 
<br/>to set up a special committee on particular issues because these issues can be dealt with by existing 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Speaker’s Ruling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing  Committees  of  Parliament  under  their  respective  areas  of  remit,  as  provided  for  under 
<br/>Standing Order 109.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this particular motion, the honourable Speaker had advised that the matters be scrutinised 
<br/>by the proposed Special Standing Committee can be covered by the existing Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs, whose mandate include matters related to health, education, social services, labour, 
<br/>culture  and  media  under  Standing  Order  109(2)(b).  The  Special  Committee  proposed  by  the 
<br/>honourable Qereqeretabua would be a duplication of this Committee’s remit and work.  Honourable 
<br/>Members are welcome to move motions proposing that these matters be looked into by a particular 
<br/>Standing Committee under whose remit these matters come under.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion on the Late Professor Brij Vilash Lal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On the matter of the motion of the late Professor Brij Vilash Lal, the Speaker’s Ruling is as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  honourable  Speaker  has  ruled  on  numerous  occasions  that  under  the 
<br/>doctrine of separation of powers, Parliament is supposed to make laws and Government 
<br/></span><span>is supposed to uphold the law to make it work.  As such Parliament cannot interfere with 
<br/></span><span>policy implementation by the Government and its statutory bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that basis, this motion is out of order as it will create rise to debate which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would purportedly interfere with the mandate of the Government.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To clarify, the matter is one for the Immigration Department and which Parliament cannot 
<br/>interfere  with.  It  is  for  the  late  Professor  Lal’s  family  to  pursue  the  matter  with  the  Department 
<br/>through  the  process  of  application  and  appeals  that  are  provided  like  other  such  cases  under  the 
<br/>Department’s jurisdiction.  If they feel that they have been unfairly treated, there are avenues for 
<br/>redress available which they should pursue.  It is not for Parliament to interfere in such matters at 
<br/>this level.  Honourable Members, I hope that, that is clear to all inside Parliament and those outside 
<br/>of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, at this juncture, we will now suspend proceedings for refreshments 
<br/>and we will resume in half an hour’s time.  We will proceed to the next item on the Agenda paper 
<br/>then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.28 a.m.
