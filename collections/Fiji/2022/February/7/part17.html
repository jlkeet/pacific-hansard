<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LANDS AND MINERAL 
<br/>RESOURCES AUGUST 2016–JULY 2017 &amp; AUGUST 2017-JULY 2018 REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. SIGARARA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament debates  the Review of the Consolidated Annual  Reports for  the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources August 2016-July 2017 and August 2017-July 
<br/>2018, which were tabled on 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SIGARARA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Acting Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I take this 
<br/>opportunity to speak on the motion with regards to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
<br/>Review Report of the Consolidated Annual Reports for the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>August 2016-July 2017 and August 2017-July 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources for the satisfactory performance shown during this period.  The Committee acknowledges 
<br/>the commitment of the former staff of the Ministry, the leadership provided during the years and their 
<br/>contribution  towards the completion of the Ministry’s achievements on the targeted output  areas.  
<br/>The Committee noted that the backlog of the Annual Reports of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources, yet, valued the consistent performance of the Ministry during the period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Members noted that the Ministry embarked on a journey that linked its 
<br/>activities  and  programmes  to  the  Peoples  Charter  for  Change,  Peace  and  Progress.    One  of  the 
<br/>highlights of the Ministry, it recorded a few sound achievements through the two departments on a 
<br/>range of activities.  One of the major achievements of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>was  the  alignment  to  the  2013  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  for  conducting  substantial 
<br/>consultations on progress to the determination of the fair share of mineral royalty.  Purposefully to 
<br/>the landowners of Nawailevu in the province of Bua, a certain percentage of royalty has been paid 
<br/>out to the rightful landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  right  of  landowners  to  fair  share  or  for  mineral  royalties  was 
<br/>distinguished under the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji Section 30, as the first of its kind, 
<br/>the fair share of the Mineral Royalties Bill was passed in Parliament on 16</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2018 and was 
<br/>gazetted on 18</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2021.  This allowed for an 80:20 fair share that is the respective landowners 
<br/>are  entitled  to  80  per  cent  of  royalty  payments  where  the  Government  retains  20  per  cent  for 
<br/>administration costs.   The beneficiaries to this will be the landowning units as well as landowners 
<br/>of freehold land where extraction of minerals take place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, a few other achievements of the Ministry for the same period was facilitated 
<br/>around 78 prospecting licenses, drilled a total of 31 boreholes for which 20 were successful, hence 
<br/>accomplished a 65 per cent success rate, 11 boreholes were reticulated and the relocation of

<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assessment of about 28 villages which were greatly affected by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and was prioritised by 
<br/>the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO).  Overall, the Department independently carried 
<br/>out their own responsibilities of the diverse communities they served.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also wishes to acknowledge the current leadership of the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  that  continues  to  strategize  and  align  its  key  output 
<br/>activities  and  programmes  towards  the  National  Development  Plan.    The  Committee  considers 
<br/>necessary  that  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  ensures  implementing  the  few 
<br/>recommendations put forth by the Committee for improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  commend  the  effort  of  the  Committee  Members  in  the  completion  of  the 
<br/>Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources July 2016-August 2017 
<br/>and August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports.  My appreciation to the Ministry’s executives for their 
<br/>timely contribution in the completion of this bipartisan Committee Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few words, as a Member moving the motion on this Report, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thank you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I also rise to make some contributions 
<br/>on  the  motion  before  Parliament.    At  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Acting  Chairperson, 
<br/>honourable Sigarara and his Committee for the Report that has been presented.  At the same time, I 
<br/>just want  to  quickly  focus on two particular areas of the recommendations, especially to do with 
<br/>recommendation one.  The recommendation from the Committee is that they are of the view that it 
<br/>is time to review the State Lands Act and instead of pegging the rent on the Unimproved Capital 
<br/>Value (UCV), they prefer to go straight to market rental.  I view that as a very bold recommendation, 
<br/>Sir, given that how rent has been assessed all these years based on UCV, now they want to go to full 
<br/>market rental.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> It is quite a challenge but I hope they now have the capacity to deal with this quite a hectic 
<br/>work of analysing sales and rental or like with like and be able to come up with enough data to guide 
<br/>them in the way they peg rental to reflect market rental.   At the same time, this is not only to do with 
<br/>the annual rent but I would like to remind the Government that there are other things such as the 
<br/>rating of municipalities.  That is also based on the UCV of the land.  How those would be considered 
<br/>together with the pegging of rental is certainly something that we on this side of the House would be 
<br/>looking forward to, especially when you have strata titles now and how the rent is going to be pegged 
<br/>on strata titles?  Those are the challenges that we on this side of House feel that recommendation no. 
<br/>1 is certainly a challenging one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation that we would like to bring to the attention of this august House, 
<br/>Sir, is the one on the reduction in rental arrears.  If I am to refer you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to copies of 
<br/>the  reports  especially  in  the  conclusion  or  to  go  back  to  recommendation  no.  4,  it  states  that  the 
<br/>Committee  would  like  to  recommend  stringent  measures  to  be  undertaken  so  as  to  reduce  rental 
<br/>arrears which now stands at $20 million.  It is quite a huge amount.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reporting period, as highlighted by the Deputy Chairperson, only covers 2016 to 2018.  
<br/>The annual rent, Sir, as indicated in the conclusion of their recommendations, the annual rent rose 
<br/>from  within  the  reporting  period  from  $4.8  million  to  $8.3  million  and  that  is  income  from 
<br/>about18,000 leases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, when one takes a snapshot at the $20 million in relation to the number of leases or the 
<br/>annual rent that is generated by the 18,000 leases, it does not reflect well, Sir, because here we only 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR August 2017-July 2017  
<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>345 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have $8.3 million as the annual rent yet the arrears are $20 million.  It needs a lot of explanation from 
<br/>the Government on this.  The reporting period should not generate that kind of arrears.  When we say 
<br/>arrears, Sir, I have already highlighted this in this august House as to how the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>calculate  the  arrears  because  as  we  understand  leases  are  contracts.    There  are  conditions  for  the 
<br/>lessor to observe and as well as the lessee.  For rental, the assessments, they are usually pegged on 
<br/>an annual basis, Sir, rental per annum.  That is in the contract.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, the mode of payment, Sir, is twice in a year, January and July. So, I feel that this $20 
<br/>million in arrears to me or for us on this side of the House is quite fictitious because it does not reflect 
<br/>well with the reporting period and the annual rental that the Ministry generates. It is only $8 million 
<br/>a year.  So, for $20 million we on this side of the House would like to advise the Government, maybe 
<br/>it is time that they relook at this arrears situation again because it is too much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two issues involved here, Sir, rental owing and rental arrears.  So, with the mode 
<br/>of payment from January to July every year, each tenant is supposed to pay their full rental at the end 
<br/>of the year.  When no rent is being received at the end of the year then that becomes arrears whereas 
<br/>when you missed your payment in January and then you have another payment in July, we on this 
<br/></span><span>side of the House term that as rental owing, so if we take away the amount owing between the two 
<br/></span><span>periods of the mode of payment, the rental arrears should be very low, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I find this quite interesting because when we were in Government, rental arrears in the lands 
<br/>used to run over $10 million only but now it is $20 million.  The only observation that we would like 
<br/>to offer here, Sir, maybe if it is possible for the Ministry to relook as how the rental arrears has been 
<br/>calculated and is now showing a $20 million amount.  This is rent that has already been earned under 
<br/>contract and it looks like to service this $20 million to recoup this $20 million, more money will need 
<br/>to be used to get back this money that has already been earned contract wise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the situation that the Ministry is in right now because they are trying to find ways to 
<br/>recover this $20 million, maybe as a suggestion from  this side of the House, they relook  at  what 
<br/>really is rent owing and what is rental areas.  Maybe that should help in the reduction of the $20 
<br/>million that they are trying to address here.  I thank you for the opportunity, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak specifically on the minerals.  
<br/>It is timely that we debate this Report as we emerged out of the pandemic, we need to charter our 
<br/>way forward especially in areas of the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report, in my view, is very timely as we look at the resource sector and what they can 
<br/>contribute to the economy. I would ask, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry look at the potential for 
<br/>minerals in Fiji and put a dollar value to it.  I say this because we know and it has been confirmed by 
<br/>the ADB that our economy is narrow based.  We have always relied on tourism and we know what 
<br/>happened during the pandemic, how tourism virtually dried up and impacting on the economy of the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had very little to fall back on, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is why it is incumbent upon us to 
<br/>start looking at other sectors of the economy and I would like to see that we look at the resources 
<br/>sector very very seriously.  Over the last couple of days I was speaking with a friend from Australia, 
<br/>and he had moved from Sydney to Armidale and I asked him what is happening?  He said, “oh, it is 
<br/>mining. I am working at a mine now in Armidale.  He said that in Australia, the mines or the minerals 
<br/>are driving the economy of Australia. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR August 2017-July 2017  
<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They contribute to 10 per cent of the GDP and the exports on minerals from Australia is about 
<br/>$150 billion a year.  I know we are not in the same scale but we also have minerals in this country 
<br/>which  properly  developed  can  contribute  to  our  GDP  in  a  bigger  way.    The  last  I  saw  was  that 
<br/>minerals contributing to our GDP is about 1.1 per cent.  We should do better than that, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir and I have always asked that we convene an economic summit.  As I said we are coming out of 
<br/>the pandemic.  We have this ADB policy paper which is very depressing reading, but I would behove 
<br/>us to look into developing other sectors of the economy. I was a little confused by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy, he appears to be suggesting that this Report should not be taken seriously by 
<br/>us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Never said that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- What it says is very clear and touching on some areas where in my 
<br/>view, we were misled by the Government. What it shows here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that between 2010 
<br/>and 2019, the growth rate for Fiji was averaging at 3.3 per cent. You ask the question, did we not 
<br/>have a Banimarama boom during that period?  Did we really have a boom?  We always said at that 
<br/>time that all this boom is not true; we have always said that.  And here is the ADB confirming just 
<br/></span><span>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ADB goes on to say that the economy was driven by borrowing and public spending. I 
<br/>cannot understand with all that huge borrowing and public spending, the average growth was only 
<br/>3.3 per cent each year; it should have been higher. So I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have been 
<br/>saying all along that the economy could have been managed better. We are seeing the results of that 
<br/>today and that is why I call again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, immediately to have an Economic Summit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our debt is now 91.6 per cent of GDP. That is being forecasted by the Government. We would 
<br/>like  to  see  a  sense  of  urgency  on  how  to  repay  this  debt.  We  grant  it  that  we  are  coming  out  of 
<br/>COVID-19 but there must be a sense of urgency on how to repay our debt. That is why, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I call for hands across the aisle and get everyone together, an Economic Summit and chart the 
<br/>way forward on how to grow the economy and also repay the debts. I do a lot of visitations to the 
<br/>settlements and villages and it is amazing how the ordinary Fijians are saying, what is happening 
<br/>with our debt, as in our dialect, “</span><span>E vakacava tiko na dinau?</span><span>”  They know about the </span><span>dinau, </span><span>they know 
<br/>about the debts.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you say </span><span>“lasulasu”</span><span>, you have been saying that you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have had all these unprecedented growth on 3.3 per cent… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- The way we were told, Mr. Speaker, it was  double digit growth all 
<br/>these years. Now we know, they were all false and we have been saying that all along. Someone there 
<br/>came up, he was the CEO for the Bureau of Statistics, he highlighted the poverty in this country and 
<br/>he got fired. He was trying to tell us the truth, the facts which did not correlate to a boom. He was 
<br/>saying, “Look, a huge segment of the people are living in poverty.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>347 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to get serious, we need to get down to 
<br/>this, map out the way forward on how to recover the economy and the resource sector is a huge sector 
<br/>to help with the economy.  I believe the time is right.  The Reserve Bank of Fiji says there is a $2 
<br/>billion liquidity in the banking system.  The foreign reserve is $3 billion, it is time to sit together and 
<br/>map out a way forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government should not bury its head in the sand as has been known to 
<br/>do and face up to the facts that things are not well in the economy.  That is the truth of the matter that 
<br/>we need to consider this as an important part of the economy and the resource sector to be an area of 
<br/>focus for everyone in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just from the Report, the Ministry needs to be properly resourced.  A lot of 
<br/>professionals are leaving, they have found better opportunities elsewhere and we understand that they 
<br/>are demotivated, there is lack of appreciation hence the departure from the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for instance, only six technical staff are monitoring 79 gravel extractors.  
<br/>This is where we have a lot of public debate of the wrong type because if the people monitoring these 
<br/></span><span>are doing their job, properly resourced, we would not have issues where it comes out to the village 
<br/></span><span>council, </span><span>tikina</span><span> council and creating tension between the landowners and the investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a  situation  that  needs  to  be  addressed  that  the  Ministry  has  to  be 
<br/>resourced and the right people are recruited and retained.  They are leaving because the system they 
<br/>work under is very biased and they are demotivated.  We need to get our act together, this is a very 
<br/>important sector for Fiji, it is contributing to the economy in a bigger way and let us move away from 
<br/>the narrow based economy that we have, that makes us vulnerable to all the types of shocks that we 
<br/>have experienced over the last couple of years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would ask the Government to take note of what is being suggested from 
<br/>this side of the House and put its effort into improving the yield, the output and the potential from 
<br/>the resource sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  the  
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; frst of all, I would like 
<br/>to thank the Members of the Committee that came up with this Report in looking at the Annual Report 
<br/>of  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources.    Before  going  into  the  recommendations  and 
<br/>addressing some of the issues that have been brought up, I would just like to start off with the last 
<br/>issue that was brought up by the honourable Gavoka where he makes this grand assertion that the 
<br/>level of people leaving the Ministry has become astronomical, that it is because people are unhappy 
<br/>with the way things are at the Ministry, that people are sad and unhappy with the way things are at 
<br/>the Ministry, and that people are sad about all these things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is not a glimmer of evidence, there is no data, these are things he is pulling out as a 
<br/>figment of his imagination, and I think that it is an absolute tragedy because it belittles the kind of 
<br/>work that is being done in the Ministry by the Permanent Secretary and her hardworking team.  It 
<br/>belittles the very hard work that has been put in over the past two years that I have been there.  Just 
<br/>to come here and to say people are living, without a glimmer of evidence, there is no data, not talking 
<br/>about who, have you been able to show the turnover data in terms of employment living?  Nothing!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in this House when we stand up to make a statement it must be based on objective 
<br/>fact. Do not come up with a figment of your imagination or what you hear beside the grog bowl or 
<br/>what people whispered to you on the streets, that is not necessarily true.  We are honourable Members

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of this august Parliament.  When we stand up to speak, we speak on the basis of fact and I say, shame 
<br/>on you for bringing that up.  If you have any evidence, bring it to me, I will then discuss it with the 
<br/>Management Team.  We have a very strong, hardworking team, and since I have been there I have 
<br/>seen the changes they have been bringing in to revolutionarise this particular Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Show us some results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There is a difference between showing results and standing up in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>House and making an assertion, when you do not have any facts to back it up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is a tragedy when we are honourable Members to say something 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Show us some results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We should not belittling the people that run our different Ministries - 
<br/>the Permanent Secretaries, the Deputy Secretaries, they all work hard.  I have seen the work that they 
<br/>put  in  -  work  on  the  costed  operational  plan,  the  strategic  plans  or  binding  the  teams  together, 
<br/>reviewing the strategic operating processes, et cetera.  I think that is the point that needs to be made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have hardworking civil servants in this country, a lot of very hardworking people.  They 
<br/>spend a lot of time and effort and I think we, the Members of this House, if we are going to belittle 
<br/>them, bring in some facts. If you have some evidence of that, give it to me and I will address it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- What percent? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We should not bring hogwash into this House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- More hogwash.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  refer  to  some  of  the  recommendations  and  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition for his comments on the first recommendation.  The recommendation there was to review 
<br/>the State Lands Act, to move to a fair market rental.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the notes that have been given by my Ministry.  The fair market 
<br/>rental represents rentals in competitive open market conditions and it is highly dependent on property 
<br/>market forces.  But the current formula based assessment on 6 per cent of the UCV represents rentals 
<br/>that are constant to land values and has a fair and transparent method of assessment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In normal economic situations, market rentals would be ideal, but now that we have COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic, market conditions are affected due to the economic downturn and challenges, and we 
<br/>will not be recommended to implement fair market rent now.  But I do take note of that suggestion, 
<br/>the suggestion of the Committee that may be in the future, we need to move towards this.  This is 
<br/>something that is always also recognised in the Ministry at the moment. At the moment, the way that 
<br/>we assess rentals is based on what is in the State Lands Act, which talks about 6 per cent UCV.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  all  Governments  as  a  matter  of  policy,  we  constantly  revise  what  we  have  in  our 
<br/>legislations.  I thank the Committee for making this suggestion, it is something that will be looked 
<br/>at,  it  is  not  currently  being  done  now  but  it  is  something  that  needs  to  be  considered.    Also,  as 
<br/>highlighted by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, we will need to make sure that we have the 
<br/>mechanisms and the people in place to do the kind of things that we need to do in order to be able to 
<br/>move from where we are now in terms of 6 per cent of UCV to move towards that fair market rental.  
<br/>For the time being, we will keep it like this while we revise and review what we are currently doing 
<br/>at the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the second recommendation, the Committee recommends for the renewal of leases to be 
<br/></span><span>conducted in a proactive manner and to regularise any informal housing before reviewing the head 
<br/></span><span>lease; yes, this is a very critical part of what the Ministry does.  It is something that I am sure all the 
<br/>Ministers that have come into this Ministry have constantly talked about - the need to make sure that 
<br/>we are more proactive in the way that we renew leases.  It has required digitising all of our systems 
<br/>which is in flow at the moment, and it also requires us to be able to  address this in our Standard 
<br/>Operating Procedures (SOPs), which have been reviewed a number of times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have processes where our Divisional Offices send out notification letters to lessees 
<br/>six months prior to the expiry date of leases.  So, six months before the leases expire, the notices are 
<br/>sent so that people know well in advance and they can start making their payments and arrangements 
<br/>that they need to do.  So, that gives lessees sufficient time to prepare all the documents that they need 
<br/>to provide, update their rental payments and to collate other requirements when applying for renewals 
<br/>accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  regards  to  regularising  all  informal  settlers  on  existing  State  land,  leases  will  be 
<br/>conducted on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of the existence on site, and arrangements 
<br/>are made with the lessee.  Approvals for this will be given by the Minister as stipulated under section 
<br/>10 of State Lands Act.  So this regularisation of people who are on State land, that exercise continues 
<br/>with the SOPs that we have in place, and we have a strong focus on trying to become more and more 
<br/>proactive in the way that we renew the leases that are already in place in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the third recommendation, that the Ministry must adhere to the Financial Management 
<br/>Act  and  the  Financial  Instructions;  this  is  something  that  the  Ministry,  in  the  presentation  of  our 
<br/>Financial Statements, makes sure that it aligns itself to all the guidelines and the guidance that is 
<br/>provided by the Ministry of Economy every now and then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the fourth recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Committee recommending 
<br/>the  stringent  measures  be  undertaken  to  reduce  the  rental  arrears  which  stands  at  more  than  $20 
<br/>million; the honourable Leader of the Opposition has talked about this.  Yes, part of the money that 
<br/>we are referring to here as the rental arrears of $20 million, is actually what he has talked about - the 
<br/>rental that is taking place for the first period but is still owing.  So, it is not totally $20 million that is 
<br/>outstanding from previous years.  There is about $7 million of that amount which will be the amount 
<br/>of money that is existing from the period that has just transpired, so there is a mixture of existing 
<br/>rental and the arrears from previous periods.

<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will also notice that the arrears has accumulated over the years and it is also a reflection 
<br/>of  the  fact  that  over  time,  when  there  is  revaluation  of  the  rents,  the  amounts  do  go  up.    So,  it 
<br/>accumulates, it is a sore thumb, and it is something that we are trying to address very strongly in the 
<br/>Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every year, the Ministry has to request Budget to assist us to have people in place - project 
<br/>officers, whose main job is to try to verify, gather data to do research and collect arrears and provide 
<br/>updates to our Senior Managers on a monthly basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are looking at strengthening and ensuring the execution of the re-entry process.  The re-
<br/>entry process is basically when someone does not pay their lease, we re-enter that land so that it can 
<br/>be given out to someone else, and in the mean time we try to collect the amount of money that is 
<br/>owed to the State.  That is something that the Ministry has been working on very strongly this year.  
<br/>We have identified a lot of the large defaulters and we are going through a process now of pursuing 
<br/>those large defaulters who still owe money to the State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are in a process of providing a lot of advice to lessees and customers.  There is a process 
<br/></span><span>of  calling  them  in  a  timely  manner  and  we  are  also  strengthening  our  media  releases,  reminding 
<br/></span><span>lessees on their rental duties and timelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also a process of undertaking arrangements with the defaulters, having a payment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plan so that they can pay off what they do over time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also enhanced the number of ways in which people can pay money to the Ministry.  
<br/>Now they can use their bank accounts, M-PAiSA and EFTPOS.  So these are further developments 
<br/>of making it easier for people to pay the money that they need to pay to the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  5  is  recommending  that  the  Ministry  should  regularise  its  established 
<br/>positions  -  Person  to  Post  positions,  and  consider  empowering  employees  through  appropriate 
<br/>training and resources.  Yes, the Ministry has made a lot of appointments.  We have exceeded a lot 
<br/>of our targets in terms of human resources.  The MQR of positions have been reviewed in accordance 
<br/>with the Ministry of Civil Service Job Evaluation Criteria, and over the past two years the Ministry 
<br/>has supported three of our staff to further their studies abroad in their specific field of work.  This 
<br/>includes  doing  programmes  -  Bachelor  Degrees,  Masters  Degrees  and  PhD  Programmes.  The 
<br/>Ministry has also worked with the Fiji National University (FNU) to implement a new Certificate 
<br/>Level coursework for mining.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  recommendation  No.  6,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  adopts  and 
<br/>implements the relevant SDGs in all fields of work. This is noted and the SDGs are now imbedded 
<br/>into our National Development Plans. So, when all Ministries develop their own Strategic Plan or 
<br/>their  Annual  Business  Plan,  it  is  already  directly  linked  to  the  SDGs  which  are  embedded  in  the 
<br/>National  Development  Plan  -  the  5-Year  National  Development  Plan  and  the  20-Year  National 
<br/>Development Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation No.7, the Committee highly proposes a 10 metre buffer zone parallel to 
<br/>the river bank and waterways for planting and development, and this will prevent soil erosion, and 
<br/>silting of river and seabeds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note this recommendation. Currently, the Rivers and Streams Act mandates that 20 feet or 
<br/>six metres is deemed as public easement or access to rivers. Any change to this will require a change 
<br/>in the legislation and this is something that will be reviewed by the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>351 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Recommendation  No.  8,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the 
<br/>Department of Lands and Surveys to be conveniently housed in one location to enhance its service 
<br/>delivery.  This  is  something  that  the  Ministry  totally  agrees  with  and  this  is  something  also  that 
<br/>Government as a whole is trying to do for all of its Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  our  Ministry  of  Lands,  we  have  people  in  different  parts  of  Suva.  So,  there  is  now  a 
<br/>Government push to look at individual Ministries and try to put them together in one place because 
<br/>that will enhance the ability to communicate and liaise with one another in the pursuit of the duties 
<br/>that they have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation No. 9, the illegal reclamation and burial of foreshore, causing depletion 
<br/>of mangrove growth should be totally prohibited to protect the marine ecosystem.  Illegal reclamation 
<br/>is prohibited and anyone found carrying out such illegal activities will be penalised by the Lands 
<br/>Department. This is carried out through a Stop Work Note and the charging of penal rent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For developments on foreshore, when an EIA report has not been approved, the Environment 
<br/>Management Act (EMA) includes a provision where upon conviction, the offender could be subject 
<br/></span><span>to  a  penalty  of  up  to  $750,000,  or  10  years  in  prison  under  Section  43  of  the  Environment 
<br/></span><span>Management Act 2005.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular issue is a cross-cutting issue which is been addressed by different Government 
<br/>Agencies, such as the Department of Lands, the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Fisheries.  
<br/>Also, we have civil society organisations, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
<br/>(IUCN),  World  Wide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF)  and  other  NGOs  and  they  get  involved  in  that 
<br/>particular area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 10 is about the Surveyors Registration Board which the Committee has 
<br/>recommended  that  the  Ministry  be  more  proactive  towards  encouraging  more  new  registered 
<br/>surveyors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now in Fiji, we have a total of 43 registered surveyors.  Six of these surveyors work in 
<br/>Government, one works in a statutory organisation and there are about 36 that we have in the private 
<br/>sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within the Ministry, we have a target to register two new surveyors in every financial year 
<br/>and the Surveyors Registration Board has registered 12 surveyors from 2016 to 2021  - three new 
<br/>surveyors were registered in 2017, one in 2018, four in 2019, one in 2020 and three until July 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  now  25  candidates  who  have  been  approved  by  the  Board  to  do  projects  for 
<br/>registration. From the 25 approved candidates, two are females and 23 are male.  So, we will continue 
<br/>to try to work with this process and try to make sure that we can have more registered surveyors 
<br/>available to do the kind of work that needs to be done to survey the land in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I conclude by thanking the Committee and its Members for the 
<br/>recommendations.  It has given a lot of food for thought to the Ministry, and we will be working on 
<br/>those recommendations as I have tried to explain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute some remarks on 
<br/>the  consolidated  but  we  can  say  now  a  historical  report  before  us  as  reviewed  by  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR August 2017-July 2017  
<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me commend the Committee for its bipartisan report especially the ten 
<br/>recommendations set out on pages 38 and 39 and I particularly hope that the honourable Minister has 
<br/>noted those recommendations as he had spoken about them just a while ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I also add that I hope that newer and emerging issues 
<br/>are being properly managed by the Ministry such as the ongoing tension around the Namosi Joint 
<br/>Venture  Mining  Exercise  and  other  extractive  projects  such  as  for  gravel,  sand  and  groundwater 
<br/>where  the  concerns  of  the  custodian  landowners  are  being  played  off  against  others,  stifled  or 
<br/>submerged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure that we can all agree that Fiji is in no need of another globally disastrous Malolo 
<br/>Resort saga and the rogue elements there as labelled by the honourable Prime Minister.  I note in the 
<br/>Report  appendix  that  the  submission  by  the  Ministry  of  Lands  in  response  to  questions  by  the 
<br/>Committee lists a total of 28 challenges to its efficiency and the solution to these challenges are also 
<br/>tabulated by the Ministry actually are quite startling, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many if not all of the inefficiencies identified in the appendix are those that are well within 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry and the civil service control.  So, the question is Mr. Speaker, what are the issues?  What 
<br/></span><span>is  the  issue?    Is  it  turf  wars,  empire-building,  dissatisfied  workforce  leading  to  high  turnover  of 
<br/>technical experts like surveyors and valuers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  unfortunately  for  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands,  in  the  Report  are  key 
<br/>performance indicators and failed grades from that period for him and his executive management 
<br/>team and when these inefficiencies are raised as they are in the Report and I am sure many of them 
<br/>still remain today, they steal from your Ministry’s effort to serve taxpayers and clients who pay the 
<br/>Minister and the Ministry to do their job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We only need to go back to the robust debates that the nation had on Bill 17 to realise that 
<br/>many complaints about slow lease application processing were not levelled at TLTB but state land 
<br/>lease applications.  Now, that is a valid indication that these issues are still there and are hastening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, before recommendation one on renewing state land annual rent can ever hope to 
<br/>take place, I would ask please show that for money, first in terms of efficiencies to taxpayers and 
<br/>clients and take heed of recommendation four first which is to recover millions in rental arrears. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of rental arrears I find it quite startling too that as listed in the 
<br/>Report, the 2016 list of arrears by lease type is the picture that it is. Of the $14.1 million in rental 
<br/>arrears, the largest arrears from 2016 are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industrial approximately $1.9 million; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Agricultural approximately $4.65 million; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Residential approximately $4.61 million; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Commercial approximately $1.6 million; 
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Special Rental approximately $740,000; 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Tourism approximately $111,000; and 
<br/>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Tenancy at will approximately $108,000. (Then there are others with smaller amounts that 
<br/>are also due). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while it may be unfair to raise these issues today especially if these issues had 
<br/>already been resolved already and the honourable Minister has pointed to that direction.  This further 
<br/>questions the efficiency of this House as well and the organisation of work before us, that we are

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>having to ask questions today of an outdated report.  This Parliament is hardly a shining example of 
<br/>efficiency  and  prudent  use  of  taxpayers’  funds  that  pay  us  to  scrutinise  in  debates  when  we  are 
<br/>debating historical records and in an election year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maybe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a Godsend that we are going back in time with late reports 
<br/>this week to  get  to  the truth of the matter and align the  </span><span>jhoot</span><span> and </span><span>lasulasu</span><span> against the facts  - the 
<br/>Government’s own facts. So, the taxpayers are reminded about the sheer disrespect and incompetence 
<br/>that they are paying for and thus they know and what to do on election day.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a short contribution to the motion and to 
<br/>thank our Standing Committee on Natural Resources for their findings and recommendations that 
<br/>could  greatly  enhance  the  Ministry’s  service  delivery.  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>response to the Committee’s report and the recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, the reports are quite outdated and should be a wake-up call 
<br/>to all ministries to ensure that annual reports are submitted on time to Parliament for scrutiny.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources is made up of two Departments namely; the Department 
<br/></span><span>of  Lands  and  Surveys  and  the  Department  of  Mineral  Resources.  The  Department  of  Lands  and 
<br/></span><span>Surveys is responsible for administration, development and management of all state land activities.  
<br/>The Department of Mineral Resources oversees and facilitates development of the country’s mineral 
<br/>and ground water resources.  The annual reports did not have any information on gender.  Sir, the 
<br/>Ministry recorded a few sound achievements through the two departments on a range of activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  major  achievement  was  the  alignment  to  the  2013  Republic  of  Fiji  Constitution  for 
<br/>conducting substantial consultation and progress to the determination of fair share of mineral royalty 
<br/>to the landowners.  There were two critical challenges faced by the Ministry. One was the resignation 
<br/>of fully-trained and experienced staff in the Ministry along the years and two, the high rental arrears 
<br/>which stands at more than $20 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out two recommendations from the Committee that really 
<br/>needs to be addressed and implemented with the recent flooding of the Western Division.  I feel that 
<br/>it is only proper that the Government should take heed of the Committee’s recommendations as well 
<br/>as the suggestions from this side of the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation seven, the Committee highly proposed a 10-metre buffer zone parallel to 
<br/>the river banks and waterways for planting and development. This will prevent soil erosion and silting 
<br/>of river and sea banks.  Recommendation 9 - the illegal reclamation and burial of foreshore causing 
<br/>depletion  of  mangrove  growth  should  be  totally  prohibited  to  protect  the  marine  ecosystem.    To 
<br/>complement every development that are being done on the mainland, it is only proper that routine 
<br/>dredging of our major rivers be closely monitored, Sir.  On that same token, I thank the Government, 
<br/>especially  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  for  the 
<br/>commissioning  of  the  desilting  works  in  the  Vitogo  River  last  week.    Sir,  the  completion  of  the 
<br/>desilting project will bring the much-needed relief to our farmers within the Drasa and Lovu sectors 
<br/>as well as the increasing number of settlements within the area which are currently affected by flood 
<br/>waters.  With those few words, Sir, I support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Thank you Sir. I also support the recommendations already there 
<br/>particularly the royalty distribution.  I think that the formula has been struck at 80 per cent and 20 
<br/>per cent but maybe to improve that is to let the landowners know when they can access that money 
<br/>and the process of doing it.  They should be properly informed on how to access it particularly for 
<br/>certain projects and development for their future generations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, on the relocation of 28 villages under </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, while I am not touching on that 
<br/>one, particularly on </span><span>TC Yasa, </span><span>the damage that has been done to Cogea Village in Wainunu, Bua and 
<br/>maybe if I could just request if you can expedite the relocation of that village in Wainunu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On commercial grazing in Nadala, Nadarivatu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the 5,000 acres, what is 
<br/>the status on the progress of the farm now?  How successful has it been?  This is important.  It is 
<br/>good  because  we  need  to  increase  the  supply  of  our  meat  for  import  substitutions.    On 
<br/>recommendation four, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on arrears more than $20 million and again I want to reiterate 
<br/>the fact that the arrears keep rising at a faster rate than the increase of annual rentals.  It is important 
<br/>that the Ministry should look at ways and means of reducing that faster rate of increase in arrears.  
<br/>Let me just give you the figures: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year 
<br/>2010 
<br/>2012 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2014 
<br/>2016 
<br/>2018 
<br/>2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Rent ($)  Annual Arrears ($) 
<br/>4.8 million 
<br/>5.8 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.2 million 
<br/>6.9 million  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ratio ($) 
<br/>108 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.4 million 
<br/>6.7 million 
<br/>8.2 million 
<br/>10 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.1 million 
<br/>9.1 million 
<br/>14.9 million 
<br/>23.3 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rate of increase of arrears is a lot faster than the rate of increase in annual 
<br/>rent  per  year  but  we  must  congratulate  the  Lands  Department  for  reduction  in  number  of  leases 
<br/>issued.  In 2012, it went down from 18,000 to 17,400 but the annual rent kept on increasing during 
<br/>those years (2012 – 2014). It increased. So, we must thank the Ministry for those reduction of leases 
<br/>particularly when Schedule A and B were transferred to TLTB, they managed to increase the annual 
<br/>rent  but  the  problem  is  there  in  trying  to  get  the  arrears  down  because  that  is  the  money  that  is 
<br/>supposed to be paid to Government of about $23 million in arrears as at 2020.  This rent should be 
<br/>in advance rather than paid in arrears, so we must find ways and means of motivating our tenants and 
<br/>lessees  to  pay  their  rent  in  advance  whether  twice  yearly  or  once  yearly,  as  long  as  they  pay  in 
<br/>advance.   It is important that the Ministry finds ways and means of motivating the tenants and lessees 
<br/>to pay their rent in advance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On surveys, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important that the titles are surveyed for registered 
<br/>leases  but  one  thing  that  the  public  is  finding  out,  it  is  a  very  expensive  and  slow  and  most 
<br/>uncompleted works are at hand.  It is a question on who monitors the surveyors’ performance, maybe 
<br/></span><span>the Surveyor’s Board?  It is a request to the Ministry to find out where the problems are in order to 
<br/></span><span>be more efficient in the services of the surveys and works are done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  already  mentioned,  the  need  for  education  and  training  of 
<br/>surveyors, valuers and geologists so that we can employ our own people here, also stopping brain 
<br/>drain going overseas.  Although we do not want to stop people from going overseas, our number one 
<br/>revenue now is remittances but as long as we continue educating and training and employing our 
<br/>local people for the future efficiency of our services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  reiterate  on  the  coastline.    There  needs  to  be  protection  of  our 
<br/></span><span>coastline, rivers, streams and tanks or buffer zones.  It is important because these are development 
<br/>conditions and the Ministry of Lands and iTLTB have these as conditions of leases.  We must not 
<br/>cut down trees to 20 feet or six metres on the other side of the riverbanks, streams and coastline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, developments going on now, they do not leave the 20 feet buffer 
<br/></span><span>zone, as we see in the Vatuwaqa industrial area.  Look at Nadonumai, it is all in the law, in the leases 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but the institutions concerned are not putting their foot down to make sure that what is in the lease 
<br/>conditions are actually applied in the development of these leases.  The best example is the Mai Suva 
<br/>Park. We must leave the coastline, mangroves are there and also on the river banks.  It is important 
<br/>that we save our rivers from litters, et cetera by cutting down all the trees on the riverbanks.  It is 
<br/>important that we have the laws, have the lease conditions and implement it on the ground.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On economic performance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would recommend that in future annual reports 
<br/>if  these  economic  institutions  give  in  their  economic  performance  right  in  front  -  two  pages  on 
<br/>production, contribution to GDP, on export and import, value adding, et cetera.  It is very important 
<br/>to capture the contribution of the economic performance of the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, on financial statements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the basis of qualified opinion, there are a lot 
<br/>of unreconciled reports in 2016 and 2017 where 673,811 was not reconciled and also over- stated 
<br/>expenditure of $157,000 in the Trust Account.  It is important that the internal control within the 
<br/>Ministry are intact.  If they do their job properly and stop these repetitive mistakes throughout the 
<br/>year as we have seen in the annual reports. It is important to have an internal control intact about 
<br/>money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a couple of points  I wish  to  make.  
<br/>Obviously,  through  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  we  are  always  tracking  on  monies  owed  to 
<br/>Government.  The Ministry of Lands, of course, has a mammoth task in trying to not only ensure that 
<br/>rent is collected but to be able to be cognisant of the socio economic impact of, for example, re-entry 
<br/>or terminating leases because we find that a number of people who are actually, whether it is tenancy 
<br/>at will, whether their leases, a lot of them are at the bottom in the socio economic scale. There are a 
<br/>lot of single mothers, there are disable persons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Few year ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may recall that Government had made an allocation, how 
<br/>to pay the rent on behalf of those people leasing land not just from the State but also from iTLTB 
<br/>where people who are particularly impoverished could not meet their requirements, we actually pay 
<br/>the lease payment on their behalf.  So, the Minister for Land obviously is very sensitive to those types 
<br/>of issues, in not creating another socio economic issue for those individual homes.  Out of the $20 
<br/>million  that  is  owed,  there  is  about  $30  million  in  arrears  which  also  includes  interest.  When 
<br/>payments are made, interests are obviously then increased substantially - $7 million is about rent that 
<br/>is owing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also seen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, quite a number of State land blocks or parcels of State 
<br/>land that are currently being subdivided.  When you subdivide the land, then the number of lessees 
<br/>obviously increase, therefore, the amount of rent owing does increase too, and that has had an impact 
<br/>obviously on that.  There has also been some reassessment of rent too.  In the same way, if we see 
<br/>provided in the Constitution now, </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land when it is leased, people must be paid the market rate.  
<br/>So this is why you will see a reassessment in terms of the premium for lands where leases that are 
<br/>now being, for example, renewed, and also leases that are being paid and reviewed every five years, 
<br/>so you will see an increase in that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, tried to make the lands lot more attractive in terms from 
<br/>a leasing perspective.  We had Bill No. 16 which is now called the Act No. 21 of 2021, and Bill 
<br/>No.17 which is Act No. 22 of 2021.  Both these amendments respectively to the State Lands Act and 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Act, essentially meant that leasing these lands has made being a lot more attractive.  In 
<br/>other words, you do not have to go and get consents if you want to connect utilities to these lands.  It 
<br/>has nothing to do with consents </span><span>per se</span><span>, of course.  This is the big </span><span>lasulasu</span><span>, now we are talking about 
<br/></span><span>lasulasu</span><span> that the Opposition did peddle.  In fact, I was with some land owning unit in Nakovacake, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR August 2017-July 2017  
<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadi on Saturday and we actually talked about now the infamous Bill No. 17 which no longer exists, 
<br/>but we have Act 22 of 2021, and they fully understood the implications of it and how actually the 
<br/>land is now a lot more attractive in terms of, for investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of those changes have been taking place.  One of the issues that 
<br/>we do find is that, the Opposition tends to think that the only contributing factor to the economy is 
<br/>what  they  call  the  primary  industry,  it  is  the  agriculture,  fisheries  and  forest.    Now  of  course, 
<br/>honourable Gavoka is talking about the mining sector, it is only 1 per cent, but actually he does not 
<br/>talk about what it used to be previously also.  We call recall in Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Land and Mineral Resources had given exploration license to a mining 
<br/>company in the Sigatoka River mouth for iron ore, the Opposition all rushed off in their little minibus 
<br/>with their plastic bottles to rescue the situation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Precisely  my  point.    When  it  suits  them,  they  are  anti-
<br/>mining.  Today they come here to this Parliament saying, “where is the mining sector, let us increase 
<br/></span><span>the extractive sector.”  They do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha.  They do not realise 
<br/></span><span>what they are saying.  When it suits them, they do not want mining, when it does not suit them, they 
<br/>want mining.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, similarly, I do not know, honourable Tikoduadua had mentioned something 
<br/>about leases. I think honourable Tikoduadua talked about it, but I had to leave the room for a minute.  
<br/>The fact of the matter is that, we now have very stringent rules around environmental compliance.  
<br/>There is exploration licence and there is actual mining licence itself.  No licence is given willy-nilly, 
<br/>there  has  to  be  greater  adherence  to  the  environmental  requirements  as  provided  for  in  the 
<br/>Environment Management Act and also the requirements placed by the Ministry of Land and Mineral 
<br/>Resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is obviously a world of difference in respect of the surface lease where 
<br/>the land owners agree whether they are </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners, State land owners or whether they are 
<br/>freehold land owners, they own the surface lease.  Anything below the ground, of course, belongs to 
<br/>the  State.    But  as  provided  for  in  the  Constitution  and  as  the  law  has  actually  been  passed  by 
<br/>Parliament, no royalty used to be paid to the landowners, 80 per cent of the royalty is now being paid 
<br/>to the landowners.  A number of strides have been made in that respect.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to also in terms of the Civil Service, I would 
<br/>like to re-echo the sentiments made by the honourable Minister for Land and Mineral Resources, is 
<br/>that again for political expediency sake, we find the Opposition time and time again whenever it suits 
<br/>them, they actually run down the civil servants.  This is really extremely poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  honourable  Minister  highlighted,  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  is  now  offering  in-
<br/>house scholarships for civil servants to even get PhDs, go and do Masters, upskill the existing civil 
<br/>servants,  getting people appointed based on merit and precisely what the  honourable Minister for 
<br/>Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  said,  “Please,  provide  a  shred  of  evidence  as  to  what  honourable 
<br/>Gavoka said.”  When he said provide evidence, he kept on saying increase the mining capacity. He 
<br/>completely obfuscated the issue.  So, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they will come to Parliament without 
<br/>any genuine facts, without any shred of evidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, Mr. Speaker, that I also would like to make is, they went on about all the 
<br/>Bainimarama boom, et cetera.  The Australian economy has grown, for example, for now 28 years at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – MLMR August 2017-July 2017  
<br/>&amp; August 2017-July 2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>357 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an average growth rate of three per cent. Some years grown one per cent, some years grown 1.5 per 
<br/>cent, some years 0.5 per cent, average rate of three per cent.  And here we have, when we have our 
<br/>three per cent, they said, “Oh, there is no boom” but they do not have a problem in so elevating what 
<br/>happens in Australia.  It is a colonial mentality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point about the boom that was being talked about was that 
<br/>when you have consecutive years of growth, it means that the pie is growing. Previously the economy 
<br/>would grow for say two years and then the third year, maybe it will go into negative growth then it 
<br/>may grow again then negative growth. You do not need that level of inconsistency.  What is critically 
<br/>important obviously is the consistency in growing because when the pie keeps on growing, it creates 
<br/>a lot more opportunities.  It is a very basic fundamental concept that has not been grasped by then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that  I also  would like to make was that, they also talked 
<br/>about the debt, repay our debt, everyone knows about </span><span>dinau</span><span>, et cetera. This is the misinformation 
<br/>that has been spread.  They do not actually talk about whenever we borrowed money, what have we 
<br/>used it for? We have not borrowed money to pay off an NBF scandal.  We have not borrowed money, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, to pay for operational cost. We have borrowed money for capital works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the breakdown, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the budgets that have been delivered under 
<br/>the  Bainimarama  Government  and  the  FijiFirst  Government,  if  you  look  at  the  percentage  of  the 
<br/>budget that has actually been spent on capital expenditure as opposed to operating expenditure and 
<br/>then compare that to prior to 2007, you will see that with the previous governments that out of the 
<br/>budget, 87 per cent was actually operating expenditure; 13 per cent, 14 per cent and 12 per cent was 
<br/>capital  expenditure.  We  have  been  spending  up  to  35  per  cent  in  capital  expenditure.    And,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, honourable Kuridrani said that no road is being built, too many potholes. He obviously 
<br/>has not been to the west bank of Sigatoka River which is now tarsealed road.  He has not been to 
<br/>Vanua Levu, Nabouwalu to Dreketi connection all tarsealed road. He has not been to Moto, Ba. He 
<br/>has not been to Sawani, Serea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  connecting  people  with  roads,  the  amount  of  rural 
<br/>electrification that has taken place has been phenomenal but what it has done, it has increased the 
<br/>productive capacity of those people who previously were not connected.  That is what good economic 
<br/>fundamentals about in terms of growing the economy. That is where the money has been spent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say again if we are borrowing money to increase the productive capacity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of our country then we should do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We should do it because we are actually  investing in  the 
<br/>future. We heard honourable Professor Prasad’s piped piper who he follows now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>recently  said  that  there  is  no  point  building  fancy  roads  in  Nadi,  a  four-lane  road  in  Nadi  with 
<br/>underground electrical cables that is what you call building capacity.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 
<br/>please urge the Opposition Members, those of them who are sensible enough and who are not prone 
<br/>to winning political points every minute and look at the long term views, this is precisely what we 
<br/>are talking about. We are talking about building capacity. They have not at one moment spoken about 
<br/>the other areas in the economy that are growing; light manufacturing is growing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were last week at Outsource Fiji launching. There are now companies that are creating 
<br/>new jobs even in the pandemic.  One of the companies that started off with 25 seats has now got 75

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>seats - 75 seats meaning that if they do three shifts, that is three rounds of 75 people being employed 
<br/>in one day, in 24 hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Australian  Government  is  working  with  us  to  ensure  that  we  build 
<br/>capacity,  the  liberalisation  of  the  telecom  sector  in  Fiji.    The  immense  reduction  in  the 
<br/>telecommunications  cost  in  Fiji,  including  the  cost  of  data,  has  meant  many  companies  are  now 
<br/>interested in moving their call centres business processing from countries, like Philippines and India, 
<br/>closer to home in a place like Fiji.  They have predicted that there is going to be a hundred thousand 
<br/>jobs in 10 years’ time, if we get the formula right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the  Budget  last  year,  we have offered 20 Year tax free holidays for people who set  up 
<br/>buildings to house Business Process Outsourcing (BPO).  They simply want to come and plug and 
<br/>play, and the age of people who are employed in the BPO sector are between the ages of 19 years 
<br/>and 33 years old. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have over 70 per cent of the population below the age of 40 years.  They are interested in 
<br/>these jobs, so we need to create these jobs.  Growing an economy is not only about the primary sector. 
<br/></span><span>Yes, of course, we can grow it, but as a percentage of contribution to our economy, we need to grow 
<br/></span><span>other services sector also and Fiji has enormous potential.  The young people in Fiji have enormous 
<br/>potential to be able to contribute to this particular sector, and that is what we are focused on, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  this  is  essentially,  in  a  nutshell,  what  the  facts  are  and  we  would  like  the  honourable 
<br/>Members to, please, think about what is happening, think about the opportunities that does exist post 
<br/>the pandemic.  We are now getting out of it.  The curfew has been lifted, more opportunities are being 
<br/>created, so we need to take a long-term view of how to pre-position ourselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with honourable Gavoka, a number of years ago, Fiji was simply dependent on sugar 
<br/>for decades.  In fact, the sugar industry carried this country.  When Dr. Wadan Narsey used to write 
<br/>good articles actually, did an analysis a number of years ago, looked at how in the early 1900s, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the Fijian sugar industry, in fact, subsidised CSR in Queensland.  A very good study.  
<br/>That was in the days when he was not in politics and supporting people like you, honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  The  point  is,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  were  completely 
<br/>dependent on the sugar industry. Then we had the tourism sector that came in, so we had only sugar 
<br/>and  tourism.  Today,  the  economy  is  far  more  diversified  and  we  need  to  continue  with  the 
<br/>diversification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, similarly, in the tourism sector itself, we simply just cannot rely on Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand.  That is what was happening. Actually through the Ministry of Tourism, we are 
<br/>trying to get different source markets - look beyond Australia and New Zealand, go to North America, 
<br/>go  to  China,  go  to  North  Asia,  go  to  the  Middle-East,  go  to  Europe,  to  spread  our  risk.    That  is 
<br/>precisely what we are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, our overall economic diversification in this country, we try to spread our 
<br/>risk.  The Aviation Academy in Nadi that is set up by Fiji Airways is already getting queries from 
<br/>people who want to fly the MAXs aircraft.  They want to come and do training here.  We have got 
<br/>the simulators.  That is another form of economic activity for us.  So, a number of things are being

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I would like to thank the Ministry of Lands and Mineral and 
<br/>Resources.  One last point I have to make regarding the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources is 
<br/>that, they play a pivotal role in also digging boreholes.  We go to many rural areas where they ask 
<br/>the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources to dig boreholes as source of water.  Because of climate 
<br/>change, wells that used to be there are now being salinated - intrusion of saltwater and the need to go 
<br/>to higher ground, so they also play a pivotal role there.  Many of the staff in this Ministry go into 
<br/>very deep rural areas and perform very hard work, and I take an exception to the fact, just for their 
<br/>own political gain, they want to run them down, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the Committee for their Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on Natural Resources to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SIGARARA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing further to say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
