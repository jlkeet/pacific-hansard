<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Oral Question could be moved to tomorrow, I have allowed for that. So we will now go onto the 
<br/>second Oral Question for today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question No. 161/2022 was thoroughly answered 
<br/>by the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport yesterday. So, I would like to 
<br/>withdraw this question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of Planting Materials for Farmers 
<br/>(Question No. 163/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/>Parliament on the Ministry’s strategies and plans to provide planting materials to support farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Member for asking this 
<br/>question.  It gives an opportunity to send the message across.  Yes, we have a programme where we 
<br/>provide planting material to farmers, whatever their requirement is and whether it is root crops or rice or 
<br/></span><span>vegetables.  We have established a seed bank where farmers will be provided with a planting material at 
<br/></span><span>no cost to them and they can return it to us within a three-year period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, this return only applies to open pollinated seeds or cuttings.  Hybrid seeds you cannot utilize 
<br/>again so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for rice farmers we provide rice seeds or if root crops we provide the suckers 
<br/>and cuttings for cassava, </span><span>duruka</span><span> et cetera. For farmers they come to the nearest agriculture office, they 
<br/>put in the request and we will provide them but once they are provided, then they are required to maintain 
<br/>the planting material, they are not provided again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to home gardening seed packs, that programme is continuing and 
<br/>it is available with free seed packs from the nearest agriculture station.  With regards to planting materials, 
<br/>there is an ongoing programme and we have also got planting materials for short term crops which are 
<br/>stored in our cooler rooms in Legalega and Sigatoka to deal with any disasters.  For example, </span><span>choraiya</span><span>,  
<br/></span><span>moca, </span><span>green</span><span> rourou </span><span>suckers that we have got on the fields.  Planting material is not an issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clearing of Drains and Creeks – Rural Tailevu and Rewa Delta  
<br/>(Question No. 164/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  inform 
<br/>Parliament on the progress and status of the clearing of drains and creeks in rural Tailevu and 
<br/>Rewa Delta? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give a brief response.  If there is a supplementary 
<br/>question  then  I  will  provide  details.    For  rural  Tailevu,  we  have  undertaken  under  two  programmes 
<br/>drainage  for  farmland  42  settlements  and  villages,  drainage  work  for  about  205  kilometres  worth 
<br/>$365,000 over the last three years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  drainage  for  rural  residential,  we  have  done  for  47  villages  and  settlements,  210 
<br/>kilometres $482,000 worth of work.  We have undertaken $1.6 million worth of drainage of Waidamu 
<br/>River which we have a separate allocation for this year to clear that River.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Rewa Delta, we have undertaken drainage work for 19 settlements worth $420,000,121 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2359 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kilometres  under  the  drainage  for  rural  residential,  we  have  done  6  villages  and  settlements,  33.5 
<br/>kilometres worth $95.000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also undertaken creek cleaning work for Waivou, Burebasaga, Noco, Nakorovou areas, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>total length of 6.5 kilometres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got details by villages, if there is a need, I am happy to give it to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member later on or now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Fisheries Sectoral Contribution to GDP 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 166/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries inform Parliament on what performance targets 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and assessments the Ministry is implementing to improve the sectoral contribution to GDP? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/></span><span>question.  In 2020, fisheries exports were provisionally recorded at $197 million.  However, last year it 
<br/></span><span>decreased to $149 million due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, despite the pitfalls, we are reassured by the Government tangible changes and this 
<br/>has been undertaken through legislation amendments and the pursuit of close business partnership and 
<br/>common development goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for offshore, the changes that have been made in the legislations and provisions 
<br/>to assist the offshore fisheries has been the omission of bunkering and provision of levy which has eased 
<br/>the operation of the tuna industry, legislative reform for 20 years long term licence for domestic fleets, 
<br/>creating  opportunities  to  modernize  the  aging  national  fleet  to  create  energy  efficient  and 
<br/>environmentally-friendly vessels which continue through the provision of tax incentives and subsidies 
<br/>and removal of all fees and charges for our subsistence fisheries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  export  volume  looks  favorable  mainly  due  to  the  increase  in  economic  contribution  of 
<br/>offshore fisheries.  Current data indicates that fisheries export will rise to about $187 million. This year 
<br/>we expect a higher return and with the opening of beche-de-mer, there will be an increase and the volume 
<br/>would have to be seen after the trade has been closed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Fisheries in pursuit of economic recovery plans to generate $500 million in the 
<br/>next three years and actions are being undertaken now to assist our fishing fleets and boost the offshore 
<br/>sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Transhipment Levy has been removed and this has reduced the cost that 
<br/>used to be paid by foreign fishing vessels at about $4,500 per tonne.  We are talking with our friendly 
<br/>neighbours to bring in their tuna resources into Fiji to help our own value added businesses here and also 
<br/>PAFCO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji currently attracts about 400 fishing vessels annually.  We are 
<br/>looking at aquaculture and improving that and some possibility of exporting aquaculture products within 
<br/>the Pacific region and that also goes for coastal fisheries.  That contribution will increase dramatically in 
<br/>the next three years.  I saw honourable Gavoka’s article in the </span><span>Fiji Times </span><span>which is totally incorrect and 
<br/>the information that is contained there, I am not sure where he brought it from.  But he even said that I 
<br/>was here on Monday, I was not here on Monday, maybe he had a discussion with </span><span>Fiji Times </span><span>to write the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>article in the newspaper.  But fisheries income looks good in the next three years with various legislative 
<br/>changes that has been put by Government now to attract more fishing vessels into Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The beche-de-mer the honourable Minister had referred to as  you know, the ban was lifted a 
<br/>couple of weeks or months ago.  We are hearing with concern that the harvest, selling and all that is pretty 
<br/>chaotic.  Can the honourable Minister assure the Parliament that is all under control and well managed 
<br/>because we are very concerned with what we are hearing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  can  I  ask the honourable  Leader of 
<br/>SODELPA to bring that as a new question in the next session, please?  That is out of the context of the 
<br/>substantive question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he mentioned beche-de-mer</span><span> </span><span>in his reply, so I want to 
<br/>know if he is banking on beche-de-mer</span><span> </span><span>to contribute</span><span> </span><span>sectorally to the GDP, then tell us how is it going.  
<br/>We are very concerned about what we are hearing, that it is chaotic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, the question that was originally asked is very clear and 
<br/></span><span>he has answered that.  He may have touched on beche-de-mer</span><span> </span><span>and you asked that as a supplementary 
<br/>question.  He has given advice that it should come as a new question in future. That is all he has done, it 
<br/>is pretty clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- He mentioned it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aging with Dignity Programme – Purpose and Plans  
<br/>(Question No. 167/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation with the Ministry’s additional 
<br/>budget under the Ageing with Dignity allocation for the 2022-2023 Financial Year inform on 
<br/>the purpose and plans for this programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to respond to the question by the honourable 
<br/>Adimaitoga on the new budget activity titled “Ageing with Dignity” in terms of its purpose and the 
<br/></span><span>implementation plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  outset  the  new  budget  activities  are  major  achievements  for  the 
<br/>Ministry  and  the  Government  as  it  is  a  bold  statement  to  cement  the  Government’s  specific 
<br/>commitment to aging or older persons in this country. Government has dedicated this new budget to 
<br/>assist with the Ageing Policy, legislative assignments through collaboration with partners as well for 
<br/>advocacy and outreach on the Rights and Protection of Older Persons. Responding to aging needs 
<br/>during emergency as well and of course to monitor and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of our 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Internationally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  development  on  aging  is  aligned  to  the  Madrid 
<br/>International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA) of 2002. Thus it is the first international agreement 
<br/>which  commits  Government  to  linking  questions  of  ageing  to  other  frameworks  for  social  and 
<br/>economic development and human rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the 2017 National Census, Fiji’s population of older persons 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="105">Page 105</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2361 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>make up a total of 10.6 percent that is 93,745 that are aged over 60 plus. In the last 11 years, the 
<br/>Fijian Government has made significant and specific approaches to address ageing through policy, 
<br/>legislation, social protection programmes, and assistive grants to partners in the sector, advocacy and 
<br/>outreach purposes.  These are inclusive of the facilitation of the National Policy on Ageing 2011 with 
<br/>the goals of inclusivity, social protection, healthy living and other enabling supporting environment 
<br/>for older persons in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provision of Social Pension Allowance amounting to $259 million with the current total 
<br/>of  47,000  recipients  and  this  also  includes  our  sugarcane  farmers.    The  provision  of  bus  fare 
<br/>concession assistance amounting to $16 million with the current total of 52,000 recipients inclusive 
<br/>of  older  persons.    In  addition,  the  passing  of  the  National  Council  of  Older  Persons  Act  2012  to 
<br/>enable the establishment of an advisory arm to Government on issues relating to ageing and older 
<br/>persons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The administration of our three State Homes or Age Care facilities: Labasa, Lautoka and Suva 
<br/>since 2016 witnessed an accumulated investment of $10.2 million thus an average of $1.4 million 
<br/>annually.  The capital purchase of furniture, fittings and equipment for our Golden Age Home in 
<br/>Labasa  with  the  allocation  of  $250,000  in  this  financial  year.    The  Labasa  Golden  Age  Home  is 
<br/></span><span>undergoing a $4.7 million facelift and is expected to be opened later this year. It is a 40 bed unit 
<br/></span><span>designed to have 20 male and 20 female residents and is approximately 1,680 square meters in floor 
<br/>and area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation of the National Minimum Standards for Institutional Homes on the Care 
<br/>of  Older  Persons  2017  and  of  course  the  provision  of  grant  assistance  to  a  total  of  11  registered 
<br/>agencies specific to services or programmes for older persons to a tune of $0.6 million. Government 
<br/>will continue to maintain this assistance with the grants to organizations for older persons with the 
<br/>provision of $60,000 in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue strengthen partnerships with development partners, 
<br/>civil society, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), private sector, communities and Faith Based 
<br/>organizations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, Government has further injected a specific 
<br/>funding  of  ageing  with  dignity  with  the  total  of  $45,000  and  this  will  ensure  more  consultative 
<br/>validation to ensure that dignity, inclusion, protection and rights of older persons in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This can be enhanced with the national mechanism championed under the national council of 
<br/>older persons via the divisional district mechanism that are currently being strengthened for older 
<br/></span><span>persons.  In short the funding enables smarter collaboration to represent the rights and dignity of all 
<br/></span><span>our older persons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  this  may  be  a  project  that  is  strategically  designed,  aligned  with  its 
<br/>implementation starts with our Ministry, it started at activities, partners and most importantly resources.  
<br/>The Ministry has a dedicated unit that looks after the policy and legislative alignments for older persons.  
<br/>It will also be witnessing the establishment of the National Council of Older Persons.  Basically the work 
<br/>for the next 12 months is designed to implement much of the activities in the first three quarters.  In 
<br/>promoting an inclusive approach, these resources are meant to add value to the four national Divisions 
<br/>centred on advocacy and awareness, consultations, spaces of emergency packages for older persons in 
<br/>evacuation centres and monitoring aspects of the programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to add that looking after the older persons must 
<br/>always remain with the families.  We live in a society where there has been a decay of many social values 
<br/>and one of these is the neglect and abuse of our senior citizens.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Members of Parliament, it becomes our responsibility to advocate for the rights of our senior 
<br/>citizens.  The Ministry will continue its programme whereby we will ensure that our senior citizens are 
<br/>aged  with  dignity  because,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  how  we  treat  the  vulnerable  in  our  society  is  a  good 
<br/>indication of the society that we live in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us teach our children to be kind, respectful and generous towards our senior citizens and that 
<br/>is something that is of great concern to the Ministry because our residential homes are currently full.  We 
<br/>do not have a spare bed because there are so much demand for children not wanting to look after their 
<br/>parents.  We do not want to grow up in a society.  We are all aging and definitely all of us want to age 
<br/>with dignity and respect.  If we lay the foundation of these very basic values to our children, I am sure 
<br/>societies will change for the better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being no supplementary question, that brings the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>end of the question time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, thank you for your cooperation and forbearance today.  We have come to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of today’s sitting and Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.
