<h3>FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS REPORTING (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS REPORTING (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 
<br/>Monday, 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  had  on  Monday  when  tabling  this 
<br/></span><span>particular motion and indeed we discussed the merits of the Bill itself fairly significantly.  I would like 
<br/></span><span>to, rather than regurgitating simply what the Bill is all about, it is set out very clearly in the explanatory 
<br/>note, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to highlight to Members on the other side in particular, that firstly as in response to what they 
<br/>had said on Monday, honourable Qereqeretabua again yesterday I think talked about the fact that, “oh, 
<br/>now when people remit money, they have to report it.”  Well, actually they do.  All remittances from 
<br/>overseas have to be reported and when we say reporting generally, Sir, not generally but reporting means 
<br/>that the financial institution has the obligation to report it to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), not the 
<br/>person who is receiving the money, not the person who is actually depositing the money, not the person 
<br/>sending the money.  It is a reporting obligation by the financial institution itself, so Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>is one thing to allay.  They need to understand that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, honourable Gavoka had mentioned the other day also, the ease of doing business, it 
<br/>will affect.  It will not affect ease of doing business because as far as the business is concerned, everything 
<br/>is normal.  It is only at the backend that the reporting is done by the banks and as highlighted, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, that majority of the transactions in Fiji are below $10,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Members on the other side need to understand that when we have what we call 
<br/></span><span>inter-banking relationships, in particular through international borders and 9/11, the ball game as far as 
<br/>financial  institutions  and  in  particular  international  transactions  are  concerned  has  changed  highly 
<br/>significantly, money is tracked now more than ever before and when our banks trade with international 
<br/>banks, before they give the tick off.  They need to ensure that we have certain standards we adhere to.  If 
<br/>other jurisdictions and indeed other international entities that monitor transactions find that the bulk of 
<br/>the transactions that are carried out on a daily basis in Fiji is not actually reported, they will raise a red 
<br/>flag, they will give a red tick, they will give a warning bell.  So, our banks come further more under 
<br/>scrutiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we have a reporting mechanism at the back end where other international institutions and banks 
<br/>know that bulk of the transactions are not below the radar but in fact are above the radar or on the raider 
<br/>I  should  say,  then  they  will  feel  a  lot  more  comfortable  to  trade  with  us,  they  will  give  a  lot  more 
<br/>credibility.  They will have a sense that our financial system has integrity and indeed that there is no 
<br/>money laundering taking place or at least been picked up, there is no terrorism financing at least it has 
<br/>been picked up and other illicit transactions.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2272 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to understand that that is the current paradigm as far as financial 
<br/>institutions are concerned in international trading.  All we are simply saying, Sir, and the banks have all 
<br/>agreed to this, they have all accepted the fact that this reporting needs to take place.  There have been also 
<br/>consultations by the Financial Intelligence Unit with all the other stakeholders including, for example, 
<br/>professional bodies or professional entities that have trust account monies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had situations where people, that is why we saw the hike in the price of real estate 
<br/>property, people turning up to law firms emptying out a bag full of money of half a million dollars, one 
<br/>million dollars in cash and saying, “I want to buy that house”.  That is what we are seeing, they know 
<br/>that.  So, this is to ensure that we have integrity in our financial system both domestically and our ability 
<br/>to transact with countries internationally and financial institutions.  This is what it is all about, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuisawau had raised the issue about the definition of “cash”; it is very simple.  If you 
<br/>look at what is being removed, what is being removed is bank drafts.  For me to get a bank draft, I have 
<br/>to go to a bank so it will get picked up.  Bank cheques, I have to go to the bank, it gets picked up by the 
<br/>bank.  Bearer bonds, it is issued by a financial institution that gets picked up.  Travellers cheques, again 
<br/>it is issued by, for example, a licenced financial institution, it gets picked up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Postal  notes,  again,  gets  picked  up  by  a  financial  institution  that  has  been  authorised  for 
<br/></span><span>transacting that type of money transaction, similarly with money orders.  So it is simplifying it, knowing 
<br/>full well that now we have a reporting mechanism that all these other definitions of cash are already being 
<br/>picked up.  So, we do not need to report it, it is always at the financial institution end where in fact it gets 
<br/>reported.  So, all the other provisions in the Act, Sir, essentially talks about the threshold being lowered 
<br/>from $10,000 to $5,000 and that is what it is all about.  Those are my introductory remarks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to respond to 
<br/>Bill No. 48 of 2022, a Bill for an Act to amend the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004. Sir, at the 
<br/>end of June 2022 our foreign reserves was at $3.6 billion equivalent to 8.4 months of retained imports.  
<br/>A major portion of this foreign reserve is related to borrowing and remittances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my response to the honourable Attorney-General’s Budget Address earlier I was thanking our 
<br/>people living overseas for financially supporting their relatives here in Fiji. Sir, at the most very difficult 
<br/>time  in  our  history  when  the  whole  world  and  our  economy  almost  came  to  a  standstill  through  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic, our people overseas were the first to answer to our call for assistance with the 
<br/>remittances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remittances represent one of the largest sources of income for people in low income and to our 
<br/></span><span>national economy when our export remains very low.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Governor of the 
<br/>Reserve Bank of Fiji was quoted lately by the media saying and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For us as a small open economy, foreign reserves are so important and it is when 
<br/>foreign reserves comes under pressure and the financial conditions domestically come under 
<br/>pressure that we need to start look at our policy setting.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He said the growth of the economy was still very renascent and fragile and we feel like it is more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overtasked of fiscal policy for Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway I was expecting the honourable Attorney-General to encourage our foreign reserve by 
<br/>incentivising remittances.  To report any transaction of an amount in cash of $5,000 and above to the 
<br/>Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) through Bill No. 48 of 2022 will only weaken our foreign reserve as it 
<br/>may discourage our people overseas to send money to relatives here and to invest back into our country.  
<br/>I say it again, it may discourage our people overseas to send money here.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2273 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is just another form of dictatorial, control of being silently introduced through Bill No. 
<br/>48 by the FijiFirst Government.  I suggest that the honourable Attorney-General should explore how we 
<br/>could localise the Government of Philippines Balikbayan Program by incentivising remittances instead.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  As usual, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in everything they seem to be completely bereft 
<br/>of ideas, always coming with this, there is some kind of serious conspiracy theory to every Bill that comes 
<br/>before this House - they need to get off that horse.  People of Fiji are watching.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Wake up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  There are quite a few of them across the way here actually would do very 
<br/>well in either Hollywood or Bollywood writing scripts seriously because their conspiracy theories are just 
<br/>absolutely amazing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we are all privy to resent and just quickly before I even commence with honourable Saukuru, 
<br/>may I ask you the question - why would it be so troublesome for anyone? We are trying to make sure that 
<br/>everyone does everything lawful. Why do you think - ‘No, you cannot do that, you should not do that, 
<br/>why? We want to live in a legal platform. People want to do things properly you know it is all transparent.  
<br/></span><span>Why would you be so against something like this - really?  Unless you are hiding something.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly as spelt out quietly eloquently earlier on …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Jealous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  I am telling you, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Honourable Rasova, listen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Listen carefully, it is not upon the person sending the money the reporting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is done by the bank. It is as simple as fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- They do not understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Why would you be worried? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all privy to the fact that the Financial Transaction Reporting Act of 
<br/></span><span>2004 it is actually a key legal safeguard.  I am sure you will all understand this.  It is a key legal safeguard 
<br/></span><span>against money laundering and terrorism financing.  Why would you be against it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Maybe they are ....  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Exactly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I can see the differing of opinion from one side to the other true also because 
<br/>they belong to do different camps at the moment: because one camp might be into money laundering who 
<br/>knows.  This Act regulates and controls the reporting of financial transactions by financial institutions.  It 
<br/>actually establishes the financial of the FIU - this is the Transaction Reporting Act of 2004.  The Act 
<br/>actually provides legislative framework of measures to combat money laundering and the financing of 
<br/>terrorism in and through Fiji.  I fully support the proposed amendment requiring financial institutions 
<br/>such as commercial banks to report all transactions of $5,000 and above and it also requires the non-bank  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>2274 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financial institutions to report only cash transactions of $5,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, just to put it into perspective Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a common practice across the country 
<br/>where the law requires businesses and institutions to report cash transactions above a certain threshold to 
<br/>agencies that are similar to Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for instance, and now I just spell out the list: 
<br/>the US does it, Fintrack in Canada does it, Austrack in Australia does it, the European Union (EU) does 
<br/>it.  Why are we so different? Why is it that you object to it even? South Africa does it, Singapore does it.  
<br/>I could run through the whole list, China does it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The silence is deafening Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And you have to put it into perspective in terms of the scale of the economy, $5,000 in Fiji is still 
<br/>a lot of money.  If it is $10,000 in the US, it is a different scale so you have to look at it and put it into 
<br/>that perspective.  The gist of the matter is that each nation implements their respective policies pertaining 
<br/>to their capacity, their frequency of transactions and the need to detect and deter money laundering and 
<br/>tax evasion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Countries that I have just mentioned are developed or larger developing countries and they garner 
<br/>transactions of larger values.  As I have just said, hence the reporting sum is significantly greater as well 
<br/>- we have to put it into perspective.  In the case of Fiji there are a number of contributing factors towards 
<br/>the notion to reduce the reporting value to $5,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  instance  primarily,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amendments  will  create  a  streamline  reporting 
<br/>abroad between the financial institutions  and the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit (FIU).  This will enable 
<br/>efficiency in the process of the commercial banks and that the banks will be able to quicken the process 
<br/>of opening bank accounts for foreign investors.  It has been evident that most of the time, it has been seen 
<br/>to be a difficult process faced by the investors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commercial banks can actually quicken up the process for opening a bank for investors where 
<br/>FIU will actually monitor these accounts and report any suspicious activity that may be found in the 
<br/>account.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this does not stop the banks from doing their checks and analysis 
<br/>but it enables agencies working in collaboration resulting in the efficiency of our processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reporting of $5,000 will enable better controls and 
<br/></span><span>movement  of  finance  both  locally  and  internationally  which  will  actually  reduce  the  gap  for  money 
<br/></span><span>laundering in terms of remittances and that is decreasing (limiting the sum) gives less opportunity for 
<br/>people for elicit ways of transferring money.  It was quite clearly spelt out by the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General when he presented the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  post-pandemic  period  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  embracing  more  and  more  online 
<br/>transactions and online purchasing, hence the compliance mechanism will actually allow for tracking of 
<br/>remittance of funds into foreign accounts, reaffirming the nature of the transactions.  Many times it is 
<br/>noted that our locals are actually cheated off and there is no formal means of depicting transactions.  
<br/>Because we are now even more in a digital mode, we need to be very, very reliant on these things.  We 
<br/>need to make sure that we have got all the necessary laws in place so we protect our country from money 
<br/>laundering and bad financial transactions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to conclude, such amendments will make our policies more sound, will also 
<br/>allow us flexibility and also be cost effective and innovative for the future and with the welfare mostly of 
<br/>all our Fijians in mind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2275 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these reforms are there to provide better services and reduction in turnover time; 
<br/>in costing processes, this is actually evident with the amendment to the FTR Act as this initially will 
<br/>actively boost basically our investor and public confidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill to amend the Financial Transactions Act. I thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute on the Financial Transactions 
<br/>Reporting Act (Amendment) Bill. I note the various features in it including amending the definition of 
<br/>‘cash’ in Section 2 to mean ‘currency and notes only’, reducing the threshold of $10,000 to $5,000 or its 
<br/>equivalent in foreign currency and also requirements for the commercial banks to report transactions of 
<br/>$5,000 and above.  Also the requirements of financial institutions including non-banks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  comments  as  alluded  to  by  my  colleagues,  why  was  the  law  being  fast-tracked 
<br/>without consultation with stakeholders and why has the Minister gagged the Financial Intelligence Unit 
<br/>from commenting on the Amendment? It would be good to get their comments and views.  It appears to 
<br/>us that this law is simple intimidation and unnecessary because FIU already has the power to examine 
<br/>bank  transactions  for  any  individual  even  without  Court  Order.    If  this  law  is  aimed  at  intimidating 
<br/></span><span>political parties, donors and candidates, the FIU already has the capacity to elicit any information required 
<br/></span><span>from banks.  So rather than leaving FEO and FIU to work corporately as they have an MOU but the rest 
<br/>of the population is being penalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The banks and non-banks financial institutions:  With this onerous reporting requirement which 
<br/>will increase cost and across the board for the already struggling public.  Banks and non-banks financial 
<br/>institutions will have to get extra staff but exchanged their banking software as I have already mentioned 
<br/>to have automatic flagging of transactions to $5,000.  All these costs will be passed onto to the consumers 
<br/>even for reporting requirements right now for non-banking institutions, for example, all the legal firms 
<br/>there is very onerous reporting requirements there, they have to fill in forms, et cetera, for all the financial 
<br/>transactions  and  this  is  creating  extra  costs  and  they  have  to  get  extra  staff  for  those  reporting 
<br/>requirements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even now that is what they have submitted.  With this they will be further bogged down and 
<br/>Government continues to make life harder for everyone, banks, non-financial institutions, ordinary people 
<br/>who are already under the burden of high living costs again demonstrating that the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>is out of touch with reality, that is the reality of the matter.  No one is hiding anything from this side   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I mean there are no actors here from Bollywood as suggested by 
<br/>honourable  Koya.    The  reality  is  that  Fiji  is  now  moving  to  a  Police  State  where  monitoring  and 
<br/>surveillance is becoming an everyday occurrence.  Soon it will become like Russia under Putin. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That is the problem and that is the way we are going.  Honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has mentioned that the person who is sending money will not report but the institutions.  
<br/>Of course, but it affects them, they will be hassled and if queries come up the person making the deposit 
<br/>will be hassled and even with this it has a psychological  impact when people are reading about this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My colleague has mentioned remittances, remittances is now becoming the major income earner 
<br/>and this can impact on that.  People will be reluctant to send money because they know they will be 
<br/>monitored by this Police State.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Not only that, they will not put their deposits here in Fiji, they will 
<br/>only send some for the survival of the families, the rest they will deposit in Australia or New Zealand.  I 
<br/>mean how much of these funds they are talking about? Honourable Attorney-General keeps on going on 
<br/>and on about terrorist financing.  Where are the terrorists?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only persons we have arrested in the last few years have been drug smugglers.  We have not 
<br/>arrested any terrorists, why do you keep on going about terrorists?  What is the percentage of terrorist 
<br/>financing which has been detected by FIU?  The reporting requirements I have already mentioned that.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not support this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to give a short contribution 
<br/>to the Bill before Parliament.  I have already mentioned in this Parliament several times that the problem 
<br/>of our economy is overregulation: too much laws  - they do not understand.  That is why there is no 
<br/>investor confidence.  That is why investment has been low because they do not have the confidence, they 
<br/>keep on changing the laws and the rules.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember in one of the sittings, honourable Seruiratu mentioned if they keep on changing their 
<br/></span><span>stand, we are not fit to manage.  And that is why that is happening here.  They keep on changing the laws.  
<br/>I believe that there is a hidden agenda referring to this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Their agenda, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently most of these political parties 
<br/>have been doing fundraising overseas for their Election campaigns in this coming Elections, and this Bill 
<br/>has been fast-tracked into Parliament to disqualify those funds from coming in to the country for the 
<br/>political parties to use in the Elections - that is the hidden agenda in here.  They know that other political 
<br/>parties  are  getting  monies  overseas  through  fundraising  and  this  Bill  has  just  been  fast-tracked  into 
<br/>Parliament to disqualify those funds.  Is this democracy?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- So that is what I just want to raise here.  We are like Russia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to say a few things: No. 1 that 
<br/>I support the motion before Parliament and specifically around Clause 3.  If you are transparent there is 
<br/>nothing to hide.  If your financial dealings are transparent there is nothing to hide, nothing to run away 
<br/>from.  I want to give us a scenario: I know many of us here I have many relatives on my side and my 
<br/>wife’s side who are farmers and ginger and </span><span>yaqona</span><span> are doing well and if they happen to uproot </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, 
<br/>they bring it down, bring that from Moala or Naitasiri, bring ginger and they sell that and make $6,000.  
<br/>They are given a receipt, they have to pay VAT when they buy things, it is accounted for because they 
<br/>have to go and take it to the place or to the person who is going to export the ginger, for example, or buy 
<br/>the </span><span>yaqona</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, when someone receives money, for example, someone aspires to be a candidate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2277 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the next Elections, receives money, saves $6,000, not reported and that source of money is being said, 
<br/>let us do this with this money.  We are giving you this money for this particular purpose.  What this 
<br/>amendment Bill is trying to do, is to allow the Supervisor of Elections (SOE), to find out where the source 
<br/>of  money  is,  just  for  the  purpose  of  election  and  to  be  able  to  find  out  and  ensure  that  it  is  used 
<br/>transparently.  As I have said before, if we are transparent in our dealings, we have nothing to hide.  
<br/>Nothing to hide at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the concern that is being raised by the other side, is being raised because I feel that 
<br/>they are thinking this is something to be able to make candidates not able to stand in the elections.  It is 
<br/>not so.   It is about transparency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, as we highlighted on Monday that this Bill should have 
<br/>come through the committees but as I said, it is a forlorn hope for us when you come up with some 
<br/>comments like that because we are talking to a wall;  having dialogue with the deaf,  setting their ways 
<br/>on how to make laws in this country.  We now hear a lot of concern about this Bill and it would have 
<br/>been better if it had gone into committee, Mr. Speaker.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here we have this Bill, a draft of the law, brought in on Monday and to be made law today, 
<br/>Thursday and the sad part about it is that, we have grown accustomed to this and we have come to accept 
<br/>it as the way to create legislation in this country.  But thankfully for the people of this country, it will be 
<br/>ending very soon.  There will be elections very soon and people will put in place a government that 
<br/>respects them, a government that place a law to them for their inputs because these are not laws about 
<br/>going to a picnic somewhere.  These are laws that have huge repercussions to the people of this country, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I ask government.  Have you carried out a survey on the impacts of the $10,000 
<br/>limit, requirements in terms of how it has encouraged the cash economy in this country because if the 
<br/>financial institutions are demanding this and they are reporting this $10,000, human nature will say that 
<br/>people  will  revert  to  cash  economy.    Do  we  know  the  impact  of  the  $10,000;  resulting  in  the  cash 
<br/>economy, Mr. Speaker and a cash economy can be the black economy.  You have not even carried out a 
<br/>study and here you are, you lower the threshold to $5,000 and my colleague, honourable Kuridrani has 
<br/>highlighted a very important point here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The perception to people and especially, Mr. Speaker, if I go on to politics or political parties, we 
<br/></span><span>all know, Mr. Speaker, that parties like SODELPA do not have big money to support them internally in 
<br/></span><span>Fiji.  We rely on the </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span> and we raise money through roti parcels, </span><span>lovo </span><span>packs and </span><span>kati</span><span> and we 
<br/>rely a great deal on our people overseas to fund our political campaign.  By creating this perception, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that your $5,000 is going to be reported, it will create doubt in the minds of our people overseas.  
<br/>All it needs, Mr. Speaker, is perception that they can be taken up for money laundering and the like. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- How! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are asking how, unknown to the remitter 
<br/>(him or her) the transaction is going to be reported to FIU, unknown to him or her that it is going to be 
<br/>reported.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Unknown to the person, so here you are the perception is there why 
<br/>should I send money to Fiji, to SODELPA because that will go to the FIU.  Can you put a side window 
<br/>please, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Trade is saying “what are you trying to hide”.  I am 
<br/>going to ask you a question, what are you trying to hide?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- You bring in something on Monday, you want it to be law on Thursday.  
<br/>What are you trying to hide? Take it out to Committees, let the people have a say on this and then you 
<br/>make it into law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We live in a digital world! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- So, do not ask us, what you are trying to hide, they are the ones who are 
<br/></span><span>hiding Mr. Speaker, Sir, they want to bring  this  legislation by ambush.  We came here on Monday, we 
<br/></span><span>did not know about this and we were told this is it, it will be Standing Order 51, no committee, it will 
<br/>become law on Thursday. That is it, you should be ashamed of yourselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But to the people of Fiji salvation is coming very, very soon. You know this, your salvation is 
<br/>near  and  you  are  going  to  get  rid  of  these  people  and  we  will  have  a  government  that  respects 
<br/>Parliamentary democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I was thinking am I going to miss this Parliament?  I am 
<br/>going to miss this, sitting across from these clowns for another four years, I do not think, I am going to 
<br/>miss them, there are some nice people there but they totally bereft.  Totally bereft of any sense of decency, 
<br/>in terms of legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you talk about policy instability, if there is anything you want to say about this 
<br/>Government, it is a instability in their policies, that is why the economy is not firing, this Bainimarama 
<br/>Boom.  This Bainimarama Boom was made possible by the public spending riding on huge borrowing, 
<br/>and that is it.  Extra for the riches paid for by debts that the </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span> will pay to the next two or three 
<br/>generation.  That is it, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Say it with tears! Say Fijians 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Fijians are </span><span>lewenivanua. </span><span>That is it, they fund their tax-cuts through debt, 
<br/>basically that is it and who is benefitting?  The big corporations can I name a few examples, yes, stamp 
<br/>duty.  It used to be a source of livelihood since 1936 but this government repealed it two years ago. It 
<br/>used to bring an $80 million for the rich.  Who suffers?  The </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span>   because we want to go and 
<br/>borrow to run the affairs of the Government that is it, and I can name other track measures they have 
<br/>neglected and have repealed in this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, every time they borrow is because they are giving tax-cuts to their cronies in the business 
<br/>sector. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge this Government to withdraw this Bill because you do not know 
<br/>how the economy is going to grow and the betterment of this country.  By doing this, people will be 
<br/>suspicious, why would you put money in the financial system, it is going to end up being reported to the

<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2279 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Intelligence Unit.  Why would you do that?  So, what you do is you work within the cash economy of 
<br/>this country because it should have gone to the Committee for us to fully understand this the implications 
<br/>of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What will you do, Mr. Speaker, is to go back to the practice in the past; two story. I was a banker 
<br/>out of high school and I used to be a teller/cashier and one day, two of my indo-Fijian colleagues said, 
<br/>“Bill can you smell the money?” I said “I am an  </span><span>itaukei”</span><span>. They said, “You know, Bill this is buried 
<br/>money, money that is used to be buried”.  I said, “I do not know, I am a </span><span>itaukei</span><span>. I do not bury money, I 
<br/>spend it” but my indo-Fijian friends knew about it.  In the past, they used to bury money. We will go back 
<br/>to burying cash now. You are frightening people from using the financial system, they will go back to 
<br/>bury money and work the cash economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It may be alright but let the voices of the people be heard. This is not something that can be 
<br/>revealed. You cannot just pass it.  It is unfortunate that we continue to see this and as I said I am talking 
<br/>to the wall. You have been trying for four years, not one suggestion from this side of the House in the last 
<br/>four years has gone down well with these people. They would not even change a sentence or a clause in 
<br/>any law from this side of the House from the last four years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, I can say to my honourable friends over here, your days are numbered, it will 
<br/></span><span>be over very soon and salvation will come to the people of Fiji, through a better Government that will 
<br/>come from this side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this motion before Parliament. It is quite 
<br/>interesting listening to the Opposition.  It shows how confused the Members are.  In fact, this legislation 
<br/>was introduced in 2004 and the whole idea was to control illegal money transaction and this legislation 
<br/>is all about black money, white money, clean money or unclean money. That is the story. That is what it 
<br/>addresses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The idea why we are reducing from $10,000 to $5,000, has been explained by the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General twice.  That 75 percent of our transactions are below $5,000 and the purpose of this 
<br/>legislation is actually to address black economy.  A true black economy Fiji is losing substantial tax 
<br/>revenue.  Can you imagine through this legislation, if we are able to recover the tax revenue, we will be 
<br/>able to use that money for roads, education and for many other purposes? That is what this legislation is 
<br/>going to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  some  of  the  Members  are  linking  this  legislation  unnecessarily  to  Russia,  to 
<br/></span><span>election and it has nothing to do with all that. It simply making sure that anyone who transfer money, that 
<br/></span><span>money is legal money in other words, one can send any amount of money, provided that you get all the 
<br/>approvals wherever required.  Say, for example, from Reserve Bank of Fiji because they control the 
<br/>inflow and outflow of money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, if all the approvals are given as a consumer, there is no obligation on you, absolutely zero. 
<br/>You just go with your money and put it across. We have explained again that whatever is done, it is done 
<br/>by the banks and in fact, non-banks as well but nothing to do with the consumer, public or investors are 
<br/>not affected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I would like to contribute to the motion on  Bill 48 of 2022, the Financial 
<br/>Transaction Reporting.  It amazes me when the $10,000 limit, has for now been decreased to $5,000.  
<br/>Who sends $10,000 that is now under microscope?  They said here that it is 75 percent of the people 
<br/>sending money are under microscope.  I will read it, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The revision of the threshold for cash transaction reports will result with  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  wider 
<br/>data set for intelligence purposes and will strengthen the ability of the Fiji Revenue Customs 
<br/>&amp;  Services  (FRCS)  and  Fiji  Intelligence  Unit  (FIU)  to  be  more  efficient  in  profiling  and 
<br/>investigating tax evasions cases. This will result in an improvement in tax revenue collection 
<br/>and tax compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  other  law  enforcement  agencies  such  as  Fiji  Police  Force  and  Fiji 
<br/> Independent Commission against Corruption (FICAC) will have access to   more  data  on 
<br/>transactions  which  will  be  useful  in  financial  investigation  linked  to  money  laundering, 
<br/>terrorist, financing and other criminal activities”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the cleaning of money.  She was saying ‘’black money”, that is why the change.  I just 
<br/>want to take us back, every time your loyal Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we see all the big finances, the 
<br/>big  companies  are  being  given  tenders  for  these  big  works  of  Government;  the  capital  grants  and 
<br/>everything.  We always say that it is always given to these people, now this Bill here is now going back 
<br/>to bite them.  I think their expiry days has come during elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can see who send this $10,000?  We just read the Fiji Bureau of Statistics on the poverty rate.  
<br/></span><span>We have about 28 percent poverty rate which now has been changed by the World Bank to 24 percent, 
<br/></span><span>but who is sending these money?  These are the people that used to fund FijiFirst and it is coming back 
<br/>to bite them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They want to see when the Government gives money to them, they want to track them down.  
<br/>Imagine the people in the stats of Fiji, there is about 190,000 immigrants that have arrived in Fiji.  These 
<br/>are the people that are sending money overseas, the people that you have accepted to come and live in 
<br/>this country; foreigners who are immigrants  and who are citizens now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, they are not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Yes, it is in the Bureau of Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out the conversation between you two.  I told you that before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- He does that all the time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you speak to him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Next time, you probably be doing it outside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Those  immigrants  that  are  coming  now,  these  are  the  people  from 
<br/>Afghanistan, China, I mean without prejudice, saying where they are coming from they are part of Fiji 
<br/>now.  They are the ones sending the money and now they are trying to track them down.  These were the 
<br/>people that were funding FijiFirst Government.  Now they are going back to bite them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- They have been attracted to females, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Anyway, the 
<br/>secrecy of this Bill, that is what the loyal Opposition always know everything in secret.  Imagine the 
<br/>Revised Estimate Budget, since I came in here in 2019, there is four estimated Budget Estimates, whereby 
<br/>20 Consequential Bills were passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, right now, about 120 Consequential Bills have been changed now and it is coming

<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2281 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>again.  Sir, three Bills will be passed today by the majority, most of them do not even know, what is 
<br/>happening over here.  They will raise their hand, without greeting, without knowing but only five of them 
<br/>will probably know.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is how worst this legislature is because half of the people or 
<br/>even 19 percent do not even know what the Bill contains, what it is for.  It is going to come back and bite 
<br/>you.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the motion.  Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am constantly bemused.  I feel almost a bit ashamed to 
<br/>listen to some of these drivel, the lack of awareness.  Honourable Gavoka is a good friend mine, but he 
<br/>has been spewing the same things since 2014, over and over again.  He is a friend of mine but he sounds 
<br/>like a broken record over and over again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been hearing about change of Government since 2014, it has not happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Awwh, so desperate! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is not going to happen. I am going to read again the bit that honourable 
<br/>Rasova was reading about why this Bill is here.  The Act came into place in the year 2004.  Why?  I will 
<br/>read from the Explanatory Note that states, and I quote:  “1.1 …for the regulation and control of financial 
<br/></span><span>institutions…”  Institutions, not the people who are sending the money and receiving, but the institutions 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji.   Listen, this is why.  I quote:  “…to prevent and detect money laundering, terrorist financing and 
<br/>other serious criminal activities.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill is trying to stop those things, so if you are against this Bill, that means you are pro-
<br/>money laundering and you pro-terrorist financing and you pro other serious criminal activities.  Anyone 
<br/>sending money to this country which is clean and legal has nothing to worry about.  If your political 
<br/>supporters in other countries want to send money to your party, they are free to do it, no one is going to 
<br/>stop them.  No one is stopping them at all.  Where is this intimidation?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ro Tuisawau talked about intimidation, who are we are trying to intimidate?  We are 
<br/>trying to intimidate people who do money laundering.  We are trying to intimidate people who do all of 
<br/>these criminal activities.  That is what this Bill is aimed at, not the people who live all around us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka was talking about our taxation system. He asks, why did you take out this 
<br/>stamp duty? Why did you take out this direct taxation? Why did you take out this direct source of revenue?  
<br/>When you look at the revenue that comes to Government, you do not only look at the direct taxation. You 
<br/>look at the impact of the changes in the taxation system to the economy as a whole.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General has been telling us that we have doubled our GDP, we have 
<br/>nine  years  of  consecutive  economic  growth.    How  did  we  do  it?  We  reduced  our  taxation  rates,  we 
<br/>reduced  our  personal  income  tax,  we  reduced  company  taxation  return  and  as  a  result  of  that,  what 
<br/>happened? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, GDP went up to an extent in a way that we run our budget every year 
<br/>for a number of years, the amount of money that we used for our operational expenditure was completely 
<br/>covered by the revenue we raised and there was surplus that we used for capital expenditure.  That is the 
<br/>Bainimarama Boom. That is the Boom that happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, I am constantly bemused.  It is amusing and I am almost a bit

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ashamed to listen to this kind of comments that we have.  I feel pity, listening to it. So, please, understand 
<br/>that.  When you look under a cupboard and if it is dark, you need to shine a light on it to see what is there. 
<br/>This is what this Bill does, it shines the light in the dark corners to make sure that it comes to light. Do 
<br/>you want that darkness to stay there or you want us to be able to track the things that are happening in 
<br/>this country that are illegal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Come into the light!  Let the light shine!  Let those who are doing the 
<br/>wrong things in the country, that light will show them for who they are.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support 
<br/>this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to say from the onset, and I 
<br/>have probably said this about half a dozen times since Monday, that all remittances prior to this Bill being 
<br/>tabled  gets  reported,  irrespective  of  the  amount.    Here,  they  are  saying  that  suddenly  by  lowing  the 
<br/>threshold, remittances will now get reported.  They have been reported from day one.  Even if tomorrow 
<br/></span><span>my cousin sends me $50 through M-PAiSA, it will get reported, not by him or by me, but the financial 
<br/></span><span>institution that is facilitating the transaction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Diplomat  from  UK  is  sitting  in  the  gallery,  in  their  country  they  do  the  same  too.    The 
<br/>honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport highlighted all the other countries that 
<br/>do that, they all do that.  So what they are saying is that, we should stop doing that, when we have been 
<br/>doing it since 2004.  What La La Land are they living on?  They believe that we live on some isolated 
<br/>island, that we have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to have credibility with financial institutions, all remittances need to be reported and they 
<br/>have  been  reported.    How  many  times  do  I  have  to  tell  honourable  Qereqeretabua,  honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua, honourable Saukuru, honourable Tuisawau, honourable Rasova, honourable Gavoka and 
<br/>everyone else?  Yesterday, only six of you were here at one stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that. All remittances have always been reported, irrespective of 
<br/>the amount.  So your theory or narrative is that, once this Act comes into play, all the people and Fijians 
<br/>living overseas will somehow or the other stop sending money.  That is what they want to do.  Absolutely 
<br/>nothing has changed for them! So there goes half of their theory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Saukuru, again, went on about remittances, “now, people will stop it”, “we should 
<br/>facilitate”,  we  are  facilitating  it.    As  we  have  highlighted  the  other  day,  more  people  are  sending 
<br/>remittances now into Fiji.  Why? Because it is very easy.  They can send it directly to the money wallets 
<br/>of their families, irrespective of where they live - through M-PAiSA and MyCash, because they have 
<br/>mobile phone connectivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who did the mobile phone connectivity?  Who did regulate the telecommunications industry?  
<br/>This man did it under the Bainimarama Government.  We injected funds into the telecommunications 
<br/>sector.    So  95  percent  of  all  the  Fijians  today  have  mobile  phone  net  connectivity.    They  do  not 
<br/>acknowledge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they said, “no consultations”.  The people who actually do the reporting, as we 
<br/>have highlighted in the introduction, had all been consulted.  The following are responses from financial 
<br/>institutions.  I had highlighted them on Monday:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and coins for non-bank financial institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the people who do the reporting, they all agree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  seen  this  continuously  on  the  floor  of  this  Parliament,  they  will, 
<br/>sometimes,  have  no  objection,  then  they  go  back  and  I  do  not  know  what  they  do  up  there  in  the 
<br/>Opposition  office  perhaps,  do  a  hurdle,  and  then  come  back  two  or  three  days  later  and  suddenly 
<br/>metamorphosise. It is like a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ situation.  Monday – they are okay, Thursday – they are 
<br/>off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  I  also  wanted  to  make  in  response  was  this,  they  went  on 
<br/>suddenly, I really believe that there is some psychological issue going on within the Opposition.  They 
<br/>live in this conspiratorial world.  Everything for them is a conspiracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me, again, just reiterate - the political party donation.  This has got nothing 
<br/>to do with political parties.  There is a separate law for that, and the law very simply says, “You can 
<br/>donate to a political party if you are a natural person”, not a company but a natural person - a human 
<br/>being.  “You can only give $10,000 maximum every 12 months.”  You cannot give any more than that, 
<br/></span><span>you can give less than that.  “You have to be a Fijian citizen or you were a former Fijian citizen.”  They 
<br/></span><span>are the people who can give. Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously, we need a name to the person who gives the 
<br/>donation.  That is all there is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had people turn up to Brown Street, our head office, giving $5.  They give $5.  You sit 
<br/>there outside and monitor it.  Do you?  They give $5, we give them a receipt.  We take their name, we 
<br/>take their address.  What is wrong with that?  We have had people giving $10,000.  What is wrong with 
<br/>that?  That is their right to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we had our list of donors published, the NFP berated them.  They made fun of them.  They 
<br/>trolled them.  They harass them.  Individually, people were harassed by their supporters.  That is affecting 
<br/>their right.  We have the list of people who gave money to the other Parties, we do not harass them.  That 
<br/>is their right.  Absolute right! Please do it.  Go ahead and get it, but just be accountable.  That is the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point we wish to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they forget that this $10,000 threshold was 
<br/>put in place by the Rabuka Government.  Honourable Tuisawau, honourable Kuridrani and honourable 
<br/>Saukuru, he is your leader.  Their government did it, the $10,000 threshold.  Honourable Rasova was 
<br/>signalling to me from there, “Make it $20,000.”  So, therefore, in the end, you lose your credibility with 
<br/></span><span>international organisations and banking institutions.  Can you imagine, Sir, if this kind of thinking is 
<br/></span><span>taking place, God forbid, if they ever were in government?  God forbid, they will run this economy down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wish to make is that, recently, 
<br/>honourable  Gavoka  has  obviously  acquired  the  services  of  some  former  booted-out  FRCS  staff,  but 
<br/>whether he has paid for it or not, I am not sure. He is only now talking about taxes.  He never talked about 
<br/>it before, but suddenly he is talking about taxes.  He says that all the tax cuts have been done Fiji, only 
<br/>for business people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Absolutely, absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me remind him.  Please, do not embarrass 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- But you embarrass me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the income tax threshold for a Fijian citizen in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji used to be $8,600.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That’s hogwash, honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- That’s a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the income tax threshold for an ordinary Fijian 
<br/>taxpayer in this country, an employee, not a servant but an employee, was $8,600.  When the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister became Prime Minister, it went up to $8,800.  You can imagine in today’s world, someone 
<br/>paying tax after earning $8,600 A few years later Sir, $16,000.  Ordinary people who work jobs in retail 
<br/>shops, in the hotels - all the hotel workers, they pay taxes.  We increased the income tax threshold to 
<br/>$16,000.  That  means,  anyone  earning  less  than  $16,000  did  not  pay  a  single  cent  of  tax.  The  entire 
<br/>$16,000 went in their pocket. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Do you hear that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and if there was a husband and wife, if they 
<br/>were in a </span><span>de facto</span><span> relationship or legally married, if they both earn $16,000, neither one of them pays 
<br/>taxes - it was on individuals.  So, $32,000 income for that household, whereas before they pay taxes if 
<br/>they earn more than $8,600. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few years later, the income tax threshold went from $16,000 to $30,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Guess what, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  The bulk of the taxpayers in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>used to earn less than $30,000 a year and today, the bulk of them do not pay PAYE.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then what happens also, Sir, whilst they pay no taxes, their children got free education, subsidised 
<br/>bus fare.  If you earn less than $30,000 a year, Sir, you pay 50 percent less on your electricity rate, we 
<br/>subsidise it.  Water, again, we subsidise it.  Those were all the benefits and they say that every entire 
<br/>taxation reduction that we have done is only for businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I also wish to make is that, the businesses that have a tax cut 
<br/>from 20 percent to 28 percent Sir, there was a World Bank Report back in 2006 that said that “one-third 
<br/>of the Fijian economy was in the black”, in other words 33.3 percent was in the black.  In other words, 
<br/>they were not detected, they were not paying taxes.  They were under the table, as they say, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- In the cupboard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- In the cupboard, under the cupboard, everywhere, on top of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cupboard too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  any  person  that  knows  a  little  bit  about 
<br/>taxation, the philosophy around taxation is that, if you achieve a rate of taxation where both parties are 
<br/>actually  in  agreement  (I  am  not  saying  there  needs  to  be  a  formal  agreement)  where  they  all  feel 
<br/>comfortable, your collection rate will increase significantly. And this is why the Fijian taxation collection 
<br/>rate, percentage of GDP, became a lot higher.  They do not talk about that, they do not understand that.  
<br/>So, it is so completely an abomination for someone to stand on the floor of this Parliament to say that all 
<br/>tax cuts, in fact, have only been done for the rich people in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they also do not talk about the fact that when we try to make things easy for the 
<br/>people, for example, when we said, “Let us increase the tobacco licence from one year to  five years, 
<br/>increase the liquor licence from one year to five years, hotel licence from one year to five years, they 
<br/>objected to it. What is that doing?  Making people’s lives easier, the ordinary Fijians, people who work 
<br/>in those premises and people who want to carry out business, Sir.  There is no more business licence 
<br/>requirements. You do not need a business licence.  If tomorrow someone wish to go and start open a shop 
<br/>to sell clothes they do not need a business licence - they do not talk about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I also wish to make, Sir, is that they have talked - honourable Bulanauca I 
<br/></span><span>think a couple of times this week talked about the danger of drugs. I think someone else talked about it. 
<br/>People who sell drugs, engage in drugs; it is illicit gains so you have to track the money - they forget 
<br/>about it but they went on about terrorism and all that.  Drug peddling is enormous business. The gains 
<br/>from that needs to be detected.  Prostitution, international human trafficking we have seen recent cases in 
<br/>Fiji. People get money from that - they need to hide that money, so we need to track that money.  FIU 
<br/>does that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka and various others have sent praises of FIU when they were appeared before 
<br/>them.  They  are  saying  they  are  doing  a  fantastic  job.    Here  they  are  working  with  their  partners  in 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand, USA, Britain, Japan everywhere else to make sure that all of us are on the same 
<br/>page to ensure that we capture these illegal transactions. It creates a lot more confidence.  It does not 
<br/>undermine  confidence because legitimate  businesses  will  know that  they  will not  be competing  with 
<br/>illegitimate businesses. That’s what gives them confidence.  If they know there is a country that adheres 
<br/>to international standards that is going one step further to comply with international standards, it actually 
<br/>secures a lot more confidence in the economy and that is precisely what we are doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2287 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank all the financial institutions actually who saw the wisdom of course to be 
<br/>able to participate with FIU and also to be able to ensure that we comply with international standards, Sir.  
<br/>There are a couple of points I wish to make. Normally when these amendments are made to the laws there 
<br/>are  regulations that  are put in place. So, once the  actual  Act  gets approved  then we  put in  place the 
<br/>regulations to help the practical implementation of the law itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last one I wish to make, honourable Gavoka again got it all wrong.  He said that because we 
<br/>changed laws therefore there is no policy stability.  Again, policies are different to laws.  Laws in many 
<br/>times in many countries are behind changes that are taking place in society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there is a policy that has been put in place to ensure that we respond to contemporary issues, 
<br/>you  actually  have  to  amend  the  laws  to  ensure  that  the  laws  actually  catch  up  with  the  new  policy 
<br/>initiatives and that the law actually catches up with what is happening in the contemporary situation. The 
<br/>simple  example  I  gave  was  that  we  amended  the  law  from  Workmen’s  Compensation  to  Workers 
<br/>Compensation.  Is that policy instability when we actually recognise that we need to take into account the 
<br/>gender issues? Is that policy instability? Is it policy instability to change the word servant to employees?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not policy instability. That is in fact re-enforcing the policy that we have.  We have a policy 
<br/></span><span>regarding gender equality, equality of opportunity but they are only obsessed with ethnicity. We have 
<br/></span><span>also taken into account things like gender, age, ability, disability, geographical location. So, there is a 
<br/>world  of  difference  between  policy  and  laws.    Amendment  to  laws  does  not  mean  there  is  policy 
<br/>instability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank all the members who have contributed to this particular amendment and the 
<br/>motion.    Last  point  I  want  to  make  which  I  picked  up  when  honourable  Usamate  made  a  point  and 
<br/>honourable Gavoka berated him for that - in the nine years of growth (if you look at the statistics properly) 
<br/>there was an increase in private sector participation in the economy.  It was increasing year on year out 
<br/>and he is absolutely correct.  We had operating surplus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Operating surplus does not take into account any loans you take.  Operating surplus basically 
<br/>means the amount of revenue you collect and the amount of operating expenditure you have.  If you 
<br/>minus that, if you have anything left with the positive, that is operating surplus.  When you have operating 
<br/>surplus, Sir, you can then get loans to further the amount that you can put in, to capital investment.  So, 
<br/>we used operating surplus to invest in capital expenditure and we borrowed money to invest.  Honourable 
<br/>Gavoka, unfortunately I understand he was at a funeral yesterday and he was not here when we actually 
<br/>discussed,  where  in  the  Local  Government  issue,  about  how  capital  projects  can  become  delayed  or 
<br/></span><span>monies are diverted because of climatic events and how we do need to borrow money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had 14 cyclones - 225 schools got damaged, most of them are privately owned but who 
<br/>rebuilds them?  Government.  We spent over $200 million just to rebuild schools, is she saying that we 
<br/>should not borrow money to rebuild those schools?  When the highway in Kabisi went away, we got a 
<br/>big hole in the ground, we do not repair that?  We have to divert funds, we have to borrow money to do 
<br/>those things.  We have to borrow money to build bridges, a lot of the bridges were failing because they 
<br/>were not built properly in the first place, some of them are getting old.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got a huge load factor now.  There were very few vehicles in Fiji before, but now there 
<br/>are a number of vehicles in Fiji.  All of these things, they do not take into account.  You cannot do analysis 
<br/>of the economy, analysis of finance, analysis of policy, in silos.  You need to take a holistic approach that 
<br/>is what government and government running is all about.  Unfortunately, none of the Opposition have 
<br/>the qualities to be able to run Government.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.
