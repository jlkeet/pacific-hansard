<h3>ELECTORAL (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>ELECTORAL (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to resolution of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on Monday 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill was a motion under SO51 and was 
<br/>talked about quite a lot also where some of the issues were highlighted by Members of the Opposition, 
<br/>indeed their opposition to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would appear to this particular Bill was in respect of Clause 3 of the Bill itself 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is section 6 dealing with the powers of the Supervisor of Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight a couple of matters in respect of this. I would also like to 
<br/>take this opportunity to raise or respond to the press statement that was issued by the Fiji Law Society in 
<br/>respect of this particular Bill itself; and how NFP has also come out endorsing the Law Society’s analysis 
<br/>of it.  Obviously they are both endorsing each other - Law Society obviously endorsing NFP it would 
<br/>appear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I do that, Sir, I wish to highlight a couple of points that the Bill is not only about the powers 
<br/>of the Supervisor of Elections.  It is also about, very practically and that is why there is an urgency for it, 
<br/></span><span>it is to do with how do we deal with the ballot papers given the fact that there is a possibility of 10 
<br/></span><span>registered political parties and the very practical issues regarding that, Sir.  Also it is about the opinion 
<br/>polls.  Sir, if you could allow me please, to just get the sample from there because I brought this here just 
<br/>to demonstrate to Members of Parliament regarding this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the ballot paper that was used in 2018 General Elections when we had 
<br/>that many political parties and the numbers that were printed.  This is why the citizens have to go and 
<br/>choose a number.  If we have given a change of political parties, if we have 300 candidates, this will be 
<br/>the size of the ballot paper.  If we have 320 candidates this will be the size of the ballot paper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now there are batches of 13, so 13 would weigh 7.6 kilogrammes. If we have 420 candidates this 
<br/>will be the size of the ballot paper and it would weigh 9.8 kilogrammes, if we have 495 candidates this 
<br/>will be size of the ballot paper and it would weigh 11.4 kilogrammes.  Sir, this weighs 12.6 kilogrammes, 
<br/>batch of 13 and this would be the size of the ballot paper with 550 candidates, 10 political parties all of 
<br/>them nominating 55 candidates with 55 seats this will be size of the ballot paper and this would be weight.  
<br/>This law amendment is to deal with such things, so the Law Society, the NFP and all of you, who are
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying get rid of this Bill are actually saying ‘let us not deal with the situation’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference in the ballot papers and this is where you slot it through, so you 
<br/>can imagine the practical issues we will have. I just wanted to highlight this and I asked the Supervisor 
<br/>of Elections to provide this to demonstrate to you the practical issues regarding this particular Bill.  And 
<br/>all the shenanigans we have heard publicly since Monday, none of them have focused on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at section 2 of the Bill it simply says “definition of a person now is 
<br/>a national or legal person’ all the other laws have it.  Honourable Tuisawau went on a conspiracy crusade 
<br/>- I do not know whether he took us to Russia or not.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, then the rest of course, is the 
<br/>amendment of section 100, which is Clause 5: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Electoral Commission must approve the method of packing, the unused, used and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spoiled ballot papers after the count of the ballot papers.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3(1B) in particular: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding  the  generality  of  subsection  (1A),  if  the  Supervisor  has  reason  to 
<br/></span><span>believe that a person has information or documents relevant to or required by the Supervisor 
<br/></span><span>for the performance of his or her functions under this Act, the Supervisor must, by notice in 
<br/>writing, direct the person to furnish such information or documents to the Supervisor.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Look at the Law Society’s spiel.  It says here that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The amendment would give the Supervisor of Elections power to compel any person 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to provide to him all the information or documents on virtually any pretext.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In other words what they are saying is that now with this amendment, the Supervisor of Elections 
<br/>can actually ask for information as to where honourable Tikoduadua went last night.  It does not have 
<br/>anything to with this particular amendment, it does not have anything to do with this particular Act - again 
<br/>he is wrong.  This is the pedestrian analysis of the Law Society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why I keep on saying the Law Society now is just a mouthpiece of a cabal of people in 
<br/>this country.  There is already a law, you see they have not ticked on to this.  The Law Society even 
<br/>supposedly representing these great legal minds.  There is already a provision under the Political Parties 
<br/>Registration Act with exactly the same provision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 26A(2): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding the generality of subsection 1 if the Registrar has reason to believe 
<br/>that a person has information or documents relevant to or required by the Registrar for the 
<br/>performance of his or her duties under this Act, the Registrar may by notice in writing ....”     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is already there - NFP, SODELPA and all the other people did not object to this particular 
<br/>provision.  It is there.  Similar provision, verbatim, word for word, verbatim means word for word – it is 
<br/>there, no objection to it, but only now they are objecting to it.  Why?  Because they have read too many 
<br/>conspiracy books.  There are other laws, I brought them all here.  Let me read them out to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Fiji National Provident Fund Act, section 99: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any  inspector  may  exercise  any  power  set  out  in  subsection  2  for  any  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following purposes - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>2290 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To find out whether this Act or the former law has been complied with; and 
<br/>To assess the correctness of information provided under this Act or the former 
<br/>law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The powers are to - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enter any place where persons are believed to be engaged employees;  
<br/>Enter at any reasonable time, any premises used or apparently used by a relevant 
<br/>person …; 
<br/>Take photographs, make videos …..” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is all there under the FNPF Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Under the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission Act, a similar provision - Section 119:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In relation to any matter relevant to the operation or enforcement of this Act, an officer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Commission may require a person (either by oral or written requisition) to furnish –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any information; 
<br/></span><span>any records or a copy thereof, ….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ensure there is compliance with this particular Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is another similar provision under FICAC Act – there is a requirement for divulging official 
<br/>information.  That has to be provided to them too for the enforcement of the actual Act itself.  There is a 
<br/>provision again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Immigration Act - Powers of immigration officers:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For the purpose of exercising powers, performing functions or carrying out duties under 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Act, an immigration officer may – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>without a search warrant, enter and search any ship, aircraft, vehicle, premises or place; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>question any person-  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span> </span><span>who desires to enter or to leave the Fiji Islands; 
<br/>(ii)</span><span> </span><span>whom the officer has reasonable grounds for believing to be a prohibited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>immigrant; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>who is applying for extension or variation of a permit or for exemption; …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these powers exist for these different agencies.  None of them - the Law Society has not 
<br/>raised an issue of privilege.  They are saying it breaches privilege.  How does it breach privilege?  Another 
<br/>provision, Financial Transaction Reporting Act, the one we have just been through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, for the purpose of complying with this particular law. To be able to enforce the provision 
<br/>on this Act, they can go and access all this information. I am going to read to read it out to all of them.  
<br/>Please note it, go and read it.  All of these provisions already exist and that seems to be the entire thesis 
<br/>of the objection to this particular amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What it has done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately and I have known him for a number of years, 
<br/>Wylie Clarke has put his name to this, selling his name again - “The proposed amendments necessarily 
<br/>extend the powers of the Supervisor of Elections beyond those necessary to fulfil its duty and power under 
<br/>the Electoral Act.”  The amendment says under the Act; whatever is required to do under the Act, he will 
<br/>do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2291 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a provision in the Act itself.  They can appeal to the Electoral Commission, they say 
<br/>there is no right of appeal.  There is also provision in the law to say that if anyone is dissatisfied with the 
<br/>law, they can take it to the courts.  They have not analysed any of that.  There is absolutely no provision 
<br/>for them saying this and then of course, and I want to bring these people in, the Law Council of Australia 
<br/>has now issued a statement just today saying whatever the Law Society has said is correct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Communications Fiji Limited, the little sounding board of theirs, went and did a story 
<br/>on it, saying that Law Council of Australia is doing it.  Where was the Law Council of Australia when 
<br/>all the shenanigans were taking place in Fiji before?  Where were they, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we had 
<br/>an electoral system …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Gavoka loves Australia so much, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if you  say Law Council of Australia, you say Qantas, must be right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Gavoka said, “oh, it is like talking 
<br/>to a wall.” Despite me reading about all these legal provisions which have been in existence in law in Fiji 
<br/>for a number of years, despite them having similar provisions, he just completely tuned off.  This is a 
<br/>serious issue.  So he has already drawn a solution or conclusion, so no matter what we say, no matter the 
<br/>facts starring in their face, they will still object to this. The reality is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment 
<br/>simply allows for the Supervisor of Elections to carry out his job under this Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- As soon as I said, “Law Council of Australia”, he said different 
<br/>story now and if you read the analysis, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is really interesting.  They say here, and I 
<br/>quote: “The Law Council has taken the view, that the use of such powers is justified only when necessary 
<br/>to achieve a legitimate purpose.” What is the legitimate purpose?  To have an election that is credible, 
<br/>that  is  a  legitimate  purpose.    So  they  are  indirectly  saying,  if  you  read  it  carefully,  that  if  it  is  for  a 
<br/></span><span>legitimate purpose, it is okay.  The Immigration Act is a legitimate purpose, FNPF is a legitimate purpose, 
<br/></span><span>tax  is  a  legitimate  purpose,  FICAC  is  a  legitimate  purpose;  all  of  them  are  a  legitimate  purpose.  
<br/>Conducting an election through a proper transparent means and having it effectively monitored, having 
<br/>it effectively enforced the laws is a legitimate purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will constrain myself to those introductory remarks as highlighted and I 
<br/>would like to, of course, reserve my other comments when the Opposition will come back with their 
<br/>retort, then I could further elucidate and go deeper into what some of the comments that have been made 
<br/>both by the various organisations including the Members of the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, time moves on.  We will now suspend proceedings for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lunch and will resume and continue with the debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.40 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>2292 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.46 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members we will continue with the debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to also make a few contributions 
<br/>in relation to Bill No. 49 that is before this august Parliament.  In doing so, I would like to raise some 
<br/>salient features of the Bill that we on this side of Parliament have observed that is being brought in with 
<br/>this Bill, Sir, especially on section 2 of the Principal Act which has been amended to include incorporated 
<br/>bodies  and  unincorporated  bodies,  Government  departments,  NGOs,  statutory  or  other  authorities  as 
<br/>provided for in the definition of a person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While still on that, we feel, Sir, the amendment is unnecessary. The interpretation Act already 
<br/>includes corporate and unincorporated bodies in the definition of “persons”.  Further, this is a settled law 
<br/>where corporate bodies have legal personalities in other words corporate bodies are regarded as an entity 
<br/>in itself.  It is like a person, it can be served a notice and taken to court as well.  We feel, Sir, that this is 
<br/>just another simple intimidation and power trip of the learned Attorney-General especially in trying to 
<br/>accommodate his lackey or the Supervisor of Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other observation that we have made, Sir, is regarding Section 6 of the Principal Act and 
<br/></span><span>which is amended to augment the powers of the Supervisor of Elections, that is, to have power to demand 
<br/>any information from any person notwithstanding any law, privacy, confidentiality or privilege that binds 
<br/>the person.  This would include FRCS, legally privileged information, banks and arguably even national 
<br/>security  confidentiality  on  the  penalty  of  $50,000  fine  for  a  natural  person  and  up  to  $500,000  for 
<br/>organisation and corporate and unincorporated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our view of this particular amendment to section 6 take gross over rates intrusion as it breaches 
<br/>other  laws,  settled  practice  for  professionals  such  as  lawyers  who  have  the  assurance  of  privilege 
<br/>communications with their clients in the interest of justice and as a pillar of the rule of law.  No wonder 
<br/>the learned honourable Attorney-General have highlighted the response from the Fiji Law Society and 
<br/>that of their Australian counterparts because this is the very thing that I have just highlighted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a power that does not existed anywhere else in the world, not even in anti-terrorism efforts 
<br/>where life is at stake; is the right to legal privilege denied, eroded as is being done through this law?  It is 
<br/>a worrying signal of the desperation of the regime to stay in power and evidence that will use all tools at 
<br/>its disposal including unethical and dictatorial laws, as they are being fast-tracked under Standing Order 
<br/>51 to satisfy the egos of the honourable Attorney-General and the Supervisor of Elections and intimidate 
<br/></span><span>candidates, donors and political parties who all have a right to participate in the electoral process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, the  FijiFirst Party is showing its dictatorial policies  where it is abusing  parliamentary 
<br/>process under Standing Order 51which is intended for emergency and riding roughshod over individual 
<br/>human rights to privacy communications and even privileged communications with their lawyers is being 
<br/>eroded in this way.  For us it is a sign of a Government that is unstable in bringing constant piecemeal 
<br/>poorly considered amendments that result in bad law, bad processes and even less fair and less credible 
<br/>elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  on  this  side  would  like  to  even  ponder  to  ask,  why  has  the  Government  not  invited  a 
<br/>Multinational Observer Group for the 2022 Elections?  All evidence of the intent to rig and win by hook 
<br/>or by crook just as they legislate by ambush as highlighted by the Leader of the SODELPA Party, I mean 
<br/>denying the people to have their say on their shoddy and poor law making process that makes life harder 
<br/>for everyone  rather than  making it  easier which is the  responsibility  of every  government than taxes 
<br/>people and governance by law.  As this is another unjust law, laws should be just, it is not to be unjust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2293 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2014 and 2018, the FijiFirst Party was perfectly happy with the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> polls that gave it very 
<br/>high poll rating yet suddenly in 2022, </span><span>Fiji Sun’s</span><span> poll is not credible. Fiji Sun has been referred to FICAC 
<br/>and the Electoral Commission, another lackey institution under the thumb of the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General has ruled </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> is in breach of the poll guidelines.  There is no honour amongst thieves, Sir 
<br/>and one can almost feel sorry for </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution to the motion on 
<br/>the floor on the amendment to the Electoral Act in support of the amendment to the Electoral Act. The 
<br/>amendment proposed in the Act is not about intimidating anyone (the voters or the candidates or the 
<br/>political parties).  The amendment in the Electoral Act is not about being dictatorial, the amendment to 
<br/>the Electoral Act suggested is not about giving excessive powers to the Supervisor of Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contributions from the other side demonstrates to me in particular that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not understand the role of Government in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when laws are made, the laws over time needs to be 
<br/></span><span>revised or new laws need to be developed, who does it?  We bring it into Parliament for debate and 
<br/></span><span>adoption.  I want to give an example, a few years back I was charged by FICAC on an issue regarding 
<br/>breach of the Electoral Act.  My lawyers argued that that was not a campaign period and then he took it 
<br/>to the Electoral Act to see the definition of “campaign period” and we found that the Electoral Act did 
<br/>not  define  “campaign  period”.    In  other  jurisdictions,  the  Electoral  Act  define  campaign  period, 
<br/>subsequently the Electoral Act was amended to include a definition of “campaign period”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over time amendments are made to laws to deal with any gaps to fix those gaps.  
<br/>Those gaps are found over time with application of the laws.  Secondly, over time, circumstances change 
<br/>and therefore the law needs to be changed to deal with that contemporary situations.  The honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General showed us this morning about how to deal with a case of large ballot papers because 
<br/>now we will see more than five, six and seven parties competing.  If they feel the full 55 candidates then 
<br/>we will be faced with how to deal with these large ballot papers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current law does not allow the Supervisor of Elections to deal with the ballot papers, once 
<br/>the  ballot  papers  are  casted,  deal  with  the  ballot  boxes,  et  cetera.    It  is  a  normal  process  to  make 
<br/>amendments to existing laws so that it is able to deal with contemporary situations and that is exactly 
<br/>what this amendment is doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg the honourable Members of the other side to see through rather than taking 
<br/>the position of being an Opposition and therefore oppose everything that the Government proposes.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I support the motion on the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to say very clearly that the NFP rejects 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Bill and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Please allow me to elaborate, honourable Members.  Firstly, 
<br/>it is against so underhanded and conniving in true FijiFirst fashion for them to bulldoze through Standing 
<br/>Order 51, whatever bright spark comes to mind from the big thinkers of their backroom click of minions. 
<br/>That  is  why  this  Parliament  has  seen  the  same  Electoral  Act  revised  several  times  within  this  2018 
<br/>Parliamentary term.  That could be why that suddenly all this hypothetical alarm scenarios being painted 
<br/>to give a fake impression that the upcoming Elections is intended to be fair and free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>2294 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the proposed section 100 tabled here, Mr. Saneem took great pains on FBC yesterday to detail 
<br/>why 13 books (the maximum number that can go to a polling station) are heavy. Then he singles out a 
<br/>Nasoavakarua  Polling  venue.  Here  is  where  the  problems  begin,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  -  there  is  no 
<br/>Nasoavakarua Polling venue.  There are polling venues namely Naisogo Settlement ground (FEO shed), 
<br/>there  is  a  Naisogovau  Community  Hall,  and  there  is  a  Naisogowaluvu  Community  Hall  but  no 
<br/>Nasoavakarua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, here  is  the second problem  - Mr. Saneem paints such  a dire scenario of 13  heavy  books 
<br/>requiring practicality because the ballot boxes need to be carried to the river at least three times climbing 
<br/>mountains, going down the hills to reach the village after an hour and a half plus hiking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main point here carried much lower down in the FBC story is that only four books will go to 
<br/>this supposed Nasoavakarua place because it means there are only 200 people registered to vote there and 
<br/>therefore only 200 ballot papers to be taken there, that would not be heavy at all. Then Mr. Saneem goes 
<br/>on to say  that “because the ballot books will be  much bigger because there  will be more  candidates 
<br/>(maybe 550 in all as we have heard today), it requires the Electoral Commission to approve a new method 
<br/>of packing unused, used, spoilt ballot papers after the count of the ballot papers”. Why such a hue and 
<br/>cry about this now?  Just simply purchased 2,000 or so new and bigger ballot boxes for every polling 
<br/></span><span>station with all the millions of public funds that have been allocated over two financial years to run the 
<br/></span><span>Elections so that there is no tampering with sealed boxes after votes have been counted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why have all these afterthoughts being tabled now for law changes and not shared with political 
<br/>parties who may have been able to provide some solutions.  Mr. Saneem just had a meeting with parties 
<br/>via zoom on the nomination process and he said nothing about these law changes. Did he not think that 
<br/>parties should be as concerned?  Let us be absolutely clear right here and right now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>Election laws are already in favour of the FijiFirst Government.  The Chief Legal Advisor to Government 
<br/>no matter what he says and how hard he pontificates in this Parliament enables that  every time they 
<br/>pushed through laws that benefit them. If these laws about Elections were about a level playing field they 
<br/>would have allowed for first, second and third readings of this Bill to ensure the full participation of the 
<br/>people, the voters and the taxpayers who pay us, who these laws most affect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new and emerging rules, hurdles, and changes of goal posts that do not affect the ruling party 
<br/>or even possibly plan with them is already in progress. That is why, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have absolutely 
<br/>no trust or confidence in either the Fiji Elections Office or the Electoral Commission, they simply have 
<br/>not earned it. But Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do trust the people of this country. We trust their wisdom and 
<br/>overwhelming flood like desire to express their will in voter turnout numbers that will astound and shock 
<br/></span><span>and end the 16 year dictatorship at the ballot box.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not say this lightly, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Just look at the number of times that the FEO and 
<br/>the Electoral Commission joint reports tabled in Parliament after the 2014 and 2018 General Elections 
<br/>received  complaints  about  FijiFirst.    How  many  actually  were  acted  upon  compared  to  Opposition 
<br/>Parties?  The facts are all written in black and white in the reports and how many times has FijiFirst been 
<br/>investigated by FICAC all the way through comparatively all this time.  FijiFirst is no clean player, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  can  claim  to  be  fully  wholly  pure  and  without  transgression  where  electoral 
<br/>violations are concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their own shameful actions of running for cover at Level 9 with mattresses, suitcases and food 
<br/>delivery simply to evade things served Court documents after the 2018 General Elections is still fresh in 
<br/>people’s minds.  We all remember how cowardly and stupid they all looked in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> walking 
<br/>and driving out than being frog marched to court to face up to a Court of Disputed Returns Petition.  What 
<br/>is worse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that Mr. Saneem himself was caught in pictures huddling late at night with 
<br/>these evaders of court document servicing.  He is supposed to represent all political parties but there he 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was clearly taking sides late at night.  He never offered any such support to NFP and SODELPA as we 
<br/>were preparing our paperwork.  And guess what?  We know exactly what was happening at level nine.   
<br/>Those of the silent 25 sitting here today were up there playing cards and drinking </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and passing 
<br/>time  to  evade  servicing  and  then  in  the  next  minute  post  photographs  in  suits  because  they  were, 
<br/>“workshopping about low hanging fruits.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir Saneem himself knows very well the case of honourable Joseph Nitya Nand, at 
<br/>two polling venues namely: Nadroga Arya College and Tuva Primary School where he and his wife were 
<br/>openly campaigning to voters who were lining up to vote on the main polling day.  A long time NFP 
<br/>Member and another party stalwart saw this happening, took photos and sent them to us.  We sent these 
<br/>photos to Mr. Saneem through viber in protest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- A Point of Order!  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that case is clear.  I cannot understand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why the honourable Member is bringing me into her discussion.  She should withdraw that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member please take note of that Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  when nothing was done we included this 
<br/></span><span>incident as a gross breach of electoral laws in a Court of Disputed Returns Petition.  Then what happened?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The courts decided to choose our witness for our Court of Disputed Returns Petition.  Right there, 
<br/>we realised what our fate would be.  This man is not worthy of any one’s trust but we are not very worried.  
<br/>We are preparing to guard our votes and no matter how high the hurdles come we have the voices and 
<br/>the prayers of change behind us pushing us forward.  We already know how they did things in 2014 and 
<br/>2018, especially during the blackout period.  People who are intimately involved in their plots have told 
<br/>us everything.  Even their moles that they sent to sit amongst us have been dealt with tactically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This week the Supervisor of Elections who now claims on FBC to have sponsored these new 
<br/>ideas, has been very busy responding to our interventions in Parliament through the media.  His fragility 
<br/>is on over drive but Mr. Speaker, Sir, who is he to this Parliament?  He bows at the feet of Parliament and 
<br/>is  accountable  to  all  of  us  despite  the  other  side  trying  to  protect  him.    We  are  elected  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament with our rights and privileges and we will use them to the fullest extent that that affords.  We 
<br/>will not bow down to that infantile want to be smart alec of a civil servant who has one job to ensure that 
<br/>people register and vote.  Even that he fails at miserably.  Just look at his low voter turnout statistics from 
<br/>2014 and 2018.  The 2014 General Elections, 91,023 of our people who were supposed to vote, did not.  
<br/>In the 2018 General Elections 178 995 of our people who were supposed to vote, did not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite this poor performance output, his contract to oversee the 2022 General Elections was 
<br/>renewed by the government majority members of the Constitutional Offices Commission.  Did he even 
<br/>make the Minimum Qualification Requirements  (MQR) for this  role  which required  certain  years of 
<br/>senior legal experience at that precise and initial time of appointment? Any other civil servant with these 
<br/>appalling results would have been sacked in a heartbeat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us not forget that in 2014, Mr. Saneem’s own Electoral Commission had to take into court on 
<br/>the eve of the 2014 General Elections because he did not listen to instructions, he forgot his own standing 
<br/>in  the  hierarchy  of  ranking  and  thought  this  Electoral  Commission  would  listen  to  him.    That  legal 
<br/>exercise again cost taxpayers’ money.  All this is also in black and white in the 2014 Joint Report of the 
<br/>FEO and Electoral Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But of course, he is going to act that way when he has a sponsor sitting in this room egging him 
<br/>on  quietly  from  the  back.    Who  can  forget  how  in  July,  2021,  Mr.  Saneem  starts  a  crusade  to 
<br/>retrospectively  remove  a  sitting  Member  the  former  honourable  Niko  Nawaikula  from  the  National 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Register of Voters because of his wrong name debacle even though Mr. Saneem registered him as a 
<br/>candidate for two Elections. It took him seven years to realise that mistake was made.  This person should 
<br/>be sacked for such poor oversights skills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, that sorry debacle honourable Niko Nawaikula led to a new stage of drama intended 
<br/>to cause confusion about all voters needing to update their voter registration using birth certificate names.  
<br/>Some women voters challenged this in court and while it is sub judice it would not surprise me in the 
<br/>slightest that even if the writ were to be issued on Monday, these women would still not have closure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Saneem knows very well that this law is clear and that everyone already on the 2014 register 
<br/>of voters cannot be struck off the voter roll unless they die or have a mental disorder or illness or commit 
<br/>a jailable offence or cease to be a Fiji citizen, Mr. Speaker.  It is all here in black and white in Section 51 
<br/>of the current Electoral Act.  If they are on the voter roll, they must vote and not be sent all over the 
<br/>countryside with wrong polling venue assignments as we told Mr. Saneem was a risk before the 2018 
<br/>Elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Jale Baba of SODELPA was taken to court for publicly raising his concern about this but he 
<br/>may have been right.  The low voter turnout statistics vindicating.  This just goes to show the extent of 
<br/></span><span>idiotic and kneejerk ideas coming from those big thinkers of the FijiFirst backroom clique of minions.  
<br/></span><span>We all know who they are.  Those big thinkers, brain trust so smart that they want to tinker and remove 
<br/>the word servant from the FDB Act that has also been before us, yet they are quite happy to suggest that 
<br/>servants exist in political parties.  Why did they not amend the same archaic and colonial words in the 
<br/>Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures) Act?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If they are so smart, why did they not put into law that the FEO will provide free bus transport to 
<br/>voters on polling day to ensure higher voter turnout for these Elections and every election thereafter.   If 
<br/>they are so smart, why do they think they have the competence to judge what good public opinion poll 
<br/>should  look  like  and  not  just  get  their  feathers  ruffled  about  the  </span><span>Fiji  Sun</span><span>  just  because  the  minister 
<br/>responsible  for  Elections  complained  about  them.    The  proof  of  this  elaborate  drama  will  be  in  the 
<br/>pudding, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Saneem is always very particular in his press releases to say he is referring 
<br/>one of his targets to FICAC for investigation.  But he did not say that about </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> so what is happening.  
<br/>Will he refer the FijiFirst Party newspaper to FICAC?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all that  I have said about the current SoE, who is also the Registrar of Political 
<br/>Parties and who is also the Secretary to the Electoral Commission validates my concerns about the power 
<br/>he now wants to have under the proposed Section 6.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Who wrote that speech?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Now he wants wide powers to demand any information from 
<br/>anyone at any time simply based on having reasons to believe that a person has information or documents 
<br/>relevant to or required by him to do his job.  Why does he want all these files, Mr. Speaker?  Why would 
<br/>he not even recognise and respect legal privilege?  The FLS has already criticised the breadth of these 
<br/>powers and their implications on human rights and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The proposed changes are inconsistent with the international core values and principles 
<br/>to  which  Fiji  has  committed  itself  including  long-established  legal  principles  on  legal 
<br/>professional privilege.  They erode civil rights protections long protected by the law.  The 
<br/>proposed amendments unnecessarily extend the powers of the SoE beyond those necessary to 
<br/>fulfil his duties and powers under the Electoral Act.  They encroach on and duplicate powers 
<br/>of investigation that are already invested in the FICAC.  If the SoE reasonably suspects that 
<br/>an offence has been committed under the Electoral Act, he can, as he has done many times  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already, report the matter to FICAC which will then exercise its powers on investigation …”   
<br/>It carries on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The attack on professional privilege is particularly serious.  The reason the privilege 
<br/>exists is to enable people to take legal advice on any action they wish to take or not to take in 
<br/>the knowledge that in doing so, they have protection.  The privilege means that no one  in 
<br/>authority can use their questions or the advice they receive as evidence against them of some 
<br/>improper or unlawful intent.  If this privilege is taken away, people cannot take advice on their 
<br/>legal rights and cannot exercise them to the fullest extent, so they may end up breaching laws.  
<br/>Encouraging compliance with the law is the practice of democratic countries which support 
<br/>the rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill provides no protection or safeguards for the information in terms of how it will 
<br/>be used or kept. The SoE is not required to maintain confidentiality or secrecy in relation to 
<br/>the information and it appears such information can be used for any purpose the SoE chooses.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, even the Law Council of Australia has spoken up in similar terms and I quote the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Law Council: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Law  Council  has  taken  the  view  that  the  use  of  such  powers  is  justified  only  when 
<br/>necessary  to  achieve  a  legitimate  purpose  and  only  when  accompanied  by  sufficient 
<br/>protections against overuse or misuse and by provisions to mitigate the adverse impact on 
<br/>individual rights.  It is essential that the public has a credible basis upon which to be satisfied 
<br/>that  these  powers  are  necessary  in  response  to  legitimate  evidence  on  the  Fijian  national 
<br/>process, in this case no such justification appears to have been made and the necessity of the 
<br/>proposed powers does not appear to have been clearly or adequately established.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  does  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  think  perhaps  that  he  will  now  demand 
<br/>information  from  journalists  to  tell  them  to  disclose  to  him  their  sources.    Is  it  because  FICAC 
<br/>investigative processes take too long for him and he needs to act swiftly with unfettered and sweeping 
<br/>power?  He forgets Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he is not a one man army and he needs people to help him 
<br/>execute commands whether or not he can rally willing accomplices to help him, is another question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No one person (present company of one and a half excluded) should be given that width and 
<br/>breadth  of  power  when  he  has  consistently  shown  over  the  years  that  he  cannot  manage  this  power 
<br/>responsibly, wisely nor fairly.  It is said he had resigned but was discouraged from doing so?  If so what 
<br/></span><span>changed his mind - quid pro quo pro … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Why you want to know? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Hush-ups? Well, we know Mr Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, let me urge the people of Fiji listening and watching, go and register 
<br/>and get ready to vote to sweep these people out, and usher in a new dawn for us all.  Thank you Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will be very brief Sir.  Considering the 
<br/>timing  of  these  two  Bills:  Bill  No.  48  of  2022  and  Bill  No.  49  of  2022,  the  timing  of  this  inflation 
<br/>mitigation package does not take a genius to figure out the hidden agenda, the reason behind all these.  
<br/>The reason is because they have the fear of losing this Elections.  They are panic, discomfort and desperate 
<br/>of losing the Elections.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see the Bill that it gives more power to the Supervisor of Elections to collect 
<br/>any information or data from everyone else.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe they should also present another 
<br/>Bill whereby to change the name of the Supervisor of Elections to be a moving election court house 
<br/>because he has everything.  What will the police do?  What is the role of the police? What is the role of 
<br/>the  FICAC? And  here  again they  want to  establish a moving  election court  house  - who will be the 
<br/>prosecutor the jury and the judge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  whole  reason  for  this  is  because  they  are  afraid  to  face  their  consequences,  their 
<br/>mismanagement for the last 16 years.  They have been talking here about economic growth, where is the 
<br/>economic  growth?   Look at the  reality  on  the  ground, the high poverty, look at the condition  of  our 
<br/>hospitals the CWM hospital these are the indicators, realities that should prove the nine years of economic 
<br/>growth  but  no,  look  at  the  minimum  wage  rate,  look  at  the  level  of  unemployment,  everything  is 
<br/>breakdown so where is the economic growth? So they are afraid Sir, this Bill confirms their fear that they 
<br/>are desperate because their mismanagement will be revealed, they are afraid of the consequences of their 
<br/>actions. Sir, I do not support this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, much has been said about this Bill by my colleagues; 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Qereqeretabua and the honourable Kuridrani.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just need to ask a few question, we did not need this in 2014 and 2018, why now? As we had 
<br/>expressed on Monday, we are on the eve of the General Elections.  Why bringing in this amendments to 
<br/>this Parliament? We were given all sorts of reasons but only now is the concern expressed by the Fiji Law 
<br/>Society and the Law Council of Australia.  And as much as we love our honourable Attorney-General, I 
<br/>think he is beaten more than he can chew on this, Mr. Speaker, because some very  serious concern are 
<br/>being expressed here by credible organisations in Fiji and Australia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I can just read, Mr. Speaker, the opening statement from the Law Council of Australia, this is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what they say, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Law Council of Australia has today backed calls about the Fiji Law Society for the 
<br/>Fiji  Parliament  to  take  more  time  to  consider  and  consult  on  the  proposed  Electoral 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill No. 49 in order to ensure it does not unnecessarily erodes Citizens right to 
<br/>privacy”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, did we consider this when we draw up this Bill? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  And you know in the words of other legal minds,  they say, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“a fundamental attack on civil liberties”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are people asking us, if the silent 25 on the other side can stand up, have the courage to 
<br/>stand up and say to the top two, this will not happen in our watch.  You cannot sit there and see your Nos. 
<br/>1 and 2 attack the civil liberties of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Everyone on this side will vote against it. We need you on the other side 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to stand up now and be counted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said the other day, the only voice I hear from the other side is honourable Adimaitoga.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone else is silent. She is now wearing the pants, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Do they realise that this Bill confers  on the Supervisor of Elections 
<br/>power that would be greater than any Royal Commission in the Commonwealth or the grand jury in the 
<br/>United  States.    We  are  now  giving  power  to  the  SOE  greater  than  any  Royal  Commission  in  the 
<br/>Commonwealth or the grand jury in the US. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At least, in the USA the Americans have the amendment. They can bring the amendment not to 
<br/>answer anything. In this case do we have anything here that we can say to the SOE my right to privacy is 
<br/>being abuse here, I will not answer to this. The way this is worded, he can demand information under any 
<br/>pretext.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this is getting ridiculous, he is saying that he can demand 
<br/>any information under any pretext.  He is just mouthing what the Fiji Law Society got fundamentally 
<br/>wrong.  I just read out the provision in the law, which is to do with any information pertaining to him 
<br/>performing his operations under the Act.  There are similar provision, Sir, in various other laws that I 
<br/></span><span>have just sighted.  They are completely forgetting that and he is misleading Parliament, he is misleading 
<br/></span><span>the public of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take note of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are having all this debate.  What we have here is a 
<br/>Bill of this magnitude that came to this floor on Monday and we have to make it a law today.  Listen to 
<br/>the uproar, listen to the concern of the people not only in Fiji but our colleagues in Australia.  Here they 
<br/>are, it is quite already. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who are they?  We are part of a global community, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They are saying who are 
<br/>they?  This party still believe that they can manufacture the trees in Fiji and that everyone in the world 
<br/>would tolerate.  They still believe in that, that is what they did when they were in the regime.  This is a 
<br/>Bill that should not be entertained in this Parliament and we agree with the Fiji Law Society that it should 
<br/>be withdrawn, taken back, brought in the proper way, have the Committee to hold consultations around 
<br/>the country because the ramifications are quite significant and serious for the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What will happen to our rights to privacy under this Bill?  The legal brains are now asking that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our rights to privacy is being compromised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  Point  of  Order  again.    The  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member is like a punch drunk boxer, who does not know when to stop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are existing laws here that actually has the same provision and suddenly 
<br/>this amendment will breach our privacy, these existing laws here, ask the lawyer behind you, he will tell 
<br/>you.  These laws in no way, breached the privacy but these laws are in place to ensure that whoever is the 
<br/>office holder of the independent organisation or entities that is entrusted to enforce the laws are able to 
<br/>obtain the information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are misguided by saying this is to do with the criminal nature.  It is nothing to do with the 
<br/>criminal  nature.    Honourable  Lenora  Qereqeretabua  has  run  away,  but  it  has  got  nothing  to  do  with 
<br/>privilege </span><span>per se</span><span>.  They know that, he is following the Fiji Law Society statement.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the best way to do this is for the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General not to pontificate, his  usual way and take this out of Parliament and give it to a Committee.  That 
<br/>is the best way of doing it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and he is being known for his mistakes.  He has changed 
<br/>many laws in this country because he pushes them through the emergency pathway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think for the sake of this country, for our people, we take this Bill back to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee and let it come through the proper path.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P.TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to add some brief thoughts on this 
<br/>Electoral  Act  (Amendment)  Bill,  in  support  of  NFP’s  completely  rejection  of  it  by  my  colleague, 
<br/>honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By the way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I marvelled when the Financial Transaction Reporting Bill was 
<br/>tabled on Monday.  I marvelled at such and elaborate concussion or panic around preventing and detecting 
<br/>money laundering, terrorist financing  and other serious  criminal activities, as is the  role of  Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit.  A marvel at the grant tails fund around evil people with evil intentions, wanting to 
<br/>effect Fiji’s inbound money posts with their attempted money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The intentional disregard of the thought about money laundering, terrorist financing and other 
<br/></span><span>serious criminal activities that is already following through our domestic money systems.  A marvel at 
<br/>how naive responses of that law think that we are, if we were to think that this classification of people  in 
<br/>money laundering and terrorist financing, et cetera would be bothered about pittance  sums like $10,000 
<br/>or $5,000 transactions into the country.  When it is a no-brainer that higher rollers like that have the means 
<br/>to charter planes, yachts, speed boats and helicopters to dump serious dirty money into the country  in 
<br/>collaboration with their domestic allies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coupled with this Electoral Act (Amendment) is about Elections.  It is about 
<br/>political party fundraising and support from our people abroad were sent in what little they can as former 
<br/>residence  and  there  has  a  lost  permit  to  support  political  candidates  as  relatives  or  acquaintances  or 
<br/>political parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing  we  can  count  on  from the  FijiFirst  Government and the minions its predictability.  
<br/>Whenever they conduct meetings with political parties, whatever falls out of their mouths, foreshadows 
<br/>what is coming. The FIU Director, Mr. Razim Buksh and the Supervisor of Elections, Mr. Mohammed 
<br/>Saneem, had a meeting with political parties a couple of months ago.  The subject of that meeting was 
<br/>fundraising by political parties, especially those done abroad and what political parties need to be mindful 
<br/></span><span>of when filing discloses, as all parties were politically exposed persons, as currently defined in this same 
<br/></span><span>Act before us and that financial institutions know them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  issues  raised  at  that  meeting  were  about  ensuring  how  to  ensure  that 
<br/>receipting  by political parties was done as per legal requirements from point of origin, as well as from 
<br/>point  of  receipt.    Mr.  Saneem  told  political  parties  present  of  an  incident  where  he  apparently  met 
<br/>someone aboard who had disclosed to him that he had donated some money to a party but still had not 
<br/>received a receipt, he can go and check with the video recording of that meeting.  But when Mr. Saneem 
<br/>feels greedy about practising to the media about us political parties and our knowledge of the law, he 
<br/>should not show his incompetence and be deliberately up to suggest that we try to ask the FIU, to do 
<br/>something not required by law at that meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFP is quite competent in the English language.  Mr. Saneem can check his 
<br/>video recording and aired that whole conversation of that meeting to the media.  What NFP asked the 
<br/>FIU for help in the nomination process, so that there would be no towing and following at that critical 
<br/>time that only has a two weak window from when the Writ is issued.  The NFP asked FIU, if it was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2301 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>possible for them to vet their candidates so that it is one major hurdle dash for FEO to manage during the 
<br/>nomination process because FEO may have up to 550 candidates within two weeks to vet and  hopefully, 
<br/>at the same consistent level of attention for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why NFP asked FIU about this in the presence of Mr. Saneem is because Mr. Saneem 
<br/>has almost flippantly boasted to parties that during nomination, if any candidate fails to disclose cash or 
<br/>in kind donations with the receipts, the Party will be deregistered.  It is all regulate out in the law at Section 
<br/>191(c) of the Political Parties Registration Code, Funding and Disclosure Act.  So all these legal loses 
<br/>that this Bill and the amendment to this Electoral Act will work in tandem to administratively strike 
<br/>political Opposition out at the last minute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are prepared for it, time will be my witness we challenged 
<br/>the government to prove us wrong with all that we are saying and to the people of Fiji are saying, go 
<br/>register, go vote, talk to each other, mobilise to support your candidates and parties, urge your families 
<br/>and friends, village and communities and let us bring Fiji back to a nation of freedom, hope and glory at 
<br/>the ballot box.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Electoral Act amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I rise to support the Electoral (Amendment) 
<br/></span><span>Act, 2022, Bill No. 49 of 2022, that is before Parliament.  Sir, I am lost for words, but let me put it this 
<br/></span><span>way, the level of buffoonery on this particular topic is absolutely amazing and outstanding.  It has actually 
<br/>become laughable, those in the public gallery are laughing, at the level of buffoonery that comes inside 
<br/>this Parliament and outside with respect to this particular kind of statements that have been made.  They 
<br/>are actually even resorting to lies, it amazing, it is quite ridiculous.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  talk  about  this  Bill,  they  talk  about  too  much  powers  being  given  to  the  Supervisor  of 
<br/>Elections,  they  forget  that  this  morning  they  were  given  a  lesson  in  law  101,  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General.  He explained to them that one, two and three pieces of legislation in there that have 
<br/>exactly the same issues that are being raised, that are being dealt with it.  Not a word was said about it by 
<br/>the other side.  Not a single word, they have actually got lawyers on the other side, they could have done 
<br/>the same thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me add some salt to the wound here, this is something with my Ministry, that Trade, Standards 
<br/>and Quality Control Act, 1992, has the same powers in it.  So, what are they talking about?  Why do you 
<br/>not go and do some research before you come here and mislead the public of Fiji?  It is actually quite 
<br/>ridiculous.  This is why I say that side and this side, buffoonery, absolute buffoonery when coming into 
<br/>Parliament and making accusations and allegations like this.  Not even thinking about it remotely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just raise this.  This law that is being passed is not just for us, it is for the 
<br/>whole of Parliament, it is for their political parties also, it is for them also to see that where they are being 
<br/>transparent.  It is for them too, it is not for us.  They forget, this is not being passed for us.  If God forbids 
<br/>tomorrow, we were not here, this country would actually literally go to the dogs, because the way they 
<br/>would change things would be we go back to completely not being answerable for anything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is actually again back to the same word, buffoonery, starting with.  Honourable Leader on that 
<br/>particular side is not here today but now, suddenly today also there is a parrot on this side who is using 
<br/>the same words and talking about this in the same manner and tone that he does.  This particular leader 
<br/>sitting on the other side of Parliament.  He is also now become a parrot for the NFP because they cannot 
<br/>speak up, because they are led by PAP; unbelievable!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually quite ridiculous the way these people actually conduct themselves 
<br/>in Parliament.  Get the facts correct, do not just jump on Australia bandwagon, get your facts correct.  Do 
<br/>not just jump on the Law Society bandwagon, get your own legal fortunes, find out, do the research.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>2302 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Attorney-General gave a proper explanation this morning, but once again, they decide to turn 
<br/>a blind eye to the truth, because that is not what they believe in.  They paddle lies on a daily basis, when 
<br/>they come to Parliament, they paddle lies and try to misinform the public all the time.  If they think this 
<br/>is too much power, go read the other piece of law.  Why was it that they have not raised something in the 
<br/>last two Parliaments we have been here, almost eight years?  Not a day, not one day did they raise anything 
<br/>out of those laws.  Where was the FLS then?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Why now?  Why did you do it now?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Hey listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Why are we doing it now?  Evolution, my friend. Evolution!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me go through this once again.  Hence, we have all the time in a day from what 
<br/>I understand.  The Bill seeks to amend five provisions of the current Electoral Act, whilst streamlining 
<br/>processes and ensuring that the work of the SoE and the Office are practical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 2 of the Act amends the definition of a person, which we all know, we all got lessons this 
<br/></span><span>morning  and  before,  and  this  new  definition  deletes  the  current  definition  and  expounds  clearly  the 
<br/></span><span>definition of a person.  It is more clear, leaving no gap or no ambiguity, leaving no limitations to the 
<br/>definition of a person.  It is quite simple.  Why would you object to it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  put  the  definition  into  context,  the  word  ‘person’  is  used  next,  after  the 
<br/>definition in section 4(1) which deals with the independence of the Electoral Commission.  The section 
<br/>states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In  the  performance  of  its  functions  and  exercise  of  its  powers,  the  Electoral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commission is not subject to the direction or control of any person or authority …”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, refers to the independence of the Electoral Commission and no natural 
<br/>person or legal person or company or association or body of persons or unincorporated, government 
<br/>department, non-government organisation, statutory authority or any other entity can direct or control the 
<br/>Electoral Commission because it is independently legislated to carry out its functions and exercise its 
<br/>powers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendments to Section 6, Mr. Speaker, includes additional subsections – (1A), (1B), (IC), 
<br/></span><span>and it generally illustrates and extends the duties and powers of the SoE, particularly with the direction 
<br/></span><span>to disclose information.  Why would you object to that?  That is what befuddles me and my mind just 
<br/>goes crazy.  Why would you object to that - any obligation to provide such information? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, if such direction is involved and information is not provided, then the person is 
<br/>committing an offence and is liable to a penalty upon conviction. These powers are important for the SoE, 
<br/>similar to the powers that have been handed out to all these other institutions that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is actually critical for a SoE to have these relevant powers to obtain information 
<br/>from any person for the purposes of carrying out his or her duty.  Now, I will say it again.  It is not just 
<br/>for our benefit, it is for their benefit.  All political parties benefit out of this, Mr. Speaker.  If we did 
<br/>something untoward, we would also be taken to task.  It is not about us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SoE’s duty is to ensure that all persons wanting to represent the people of Fiji are able to do 
<br/>so.  It is the SoE’s duty to ensure that the elections are free and fair, and let me say this quite categorically, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, the freest and fairest elections have been held under this Government  – 2014 and 2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2303 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General Elections.  The fairest and freest elections in our history has been the 2014 and 2018 General 
<br/>Elections  under  this  Government  and  under  the  leadership  of  our  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, once again also, they went off on some diatribe about the silent 25.  You know 
<br/>nothing  about how our Party  operates!    You know  absolutely  nothing!    Look at  all  you lot,  you  are 
<br/>befuddled lost bunch of people who have no rudder in your ship, you do not even have a captain left 
<br/>anymore.  There is five, six, seven different captains, ten different leaders, people saying different things 
<br/>from different directions, no idea!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- And the best part of this all, Mr. Speaker, they want to become the next 
<br/>government. Oh!  I feel sorry for our Fijian people if they ever came and sat on this side, they would not 
<br/>know Arthur from Martha. Tuesday to Sunday – they would not know the difference, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is so draconian, Mr. Speaker, about these particular things that we need to do. The outburst 
<br/></span><span>by the Opposition and their merry men outside the House is actually uncalled for.  We, on this side of 
<br/>Parliament, Mr. Speaker, have no issues with providing information that is relevant for the SoE to carry 
<br/>out his or her duties - none whatsoever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The objections  and call  for  the  withdrawal of this  Bill  by  the  Opposition  is simple  and clear 
<br/>indication that they probably have information to hide.  That is why they do not want it.  Honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad, who is not here, seems to make and calls everyone godlike.  Again, he should check 
<br/>before he says things, Sir.  There is nothing godlike, only because an agency is being given additional 
<br/>responsibility to obtain better information.  This actually shows the lack of respect that the honourable 
<br/>Member has for religion and God, if you are going to mention God like that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The removal of subsection (7) from section 36 is important, as this deletion anticipates what may 
<br/>possibly happen during an election.  It is anticipated that the series or numbers from previous elections 
<br/>may occur, and having that provision puts the validity of election at stake.  That is why the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General went through a very lucid explanation on all of that this morning for all of us to see and 
<br/>you should understand it.  Look at the general public, they would have understood all of that.  I cannot 
<br/>understand why they cannot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the event that there are repetition of numbers that occur during the General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Elections, there is no breach to any provision and the process of the Election continues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendments in the Bill to section 100 with respect to packaging, transfer of 
<br/>ballot papers and other election materials after count also enables the Electoral Commission to approve 
<br/>the method of packing for ballot papers that are unused but spoiled.  Practically,  I am reiterating the 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Election Office will be required to send a certain number of books to every polling station 
<br/>with a maximum number of candidates and the same number of books containing 50 ballot papers will 
<br/>be required to be sent to a polling station, and if there are lesser candidates in a polling station, then there 
<br/>needs to be a method of packing which is approved by law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are practical measures of operations for the FEO.  We want to make our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>elections fair and free and make sure that these practical measures are actually put in place so that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>2304 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can be done in a swift manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 110 provides also for restriction on opinion polls.  Very simply put.  So the amendments 
<br/>and inclusions of a new subsection 110, with its subsections 1 and A, make it mandatory for the Electoral 
<br/>Commission to adopt and publish guidelines on opinion polls, surveys or research related to ensure the 
<br/>orderly conduct of free and fair elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can request information and that person must disclose information, particularly if there is 
<br/>inconsistency to those particular adopted guidelines.  He is also obligated to direct the removal or correct 
<br/>any published information which must be adhered to by those directed.  Failing to do so, again, is an 
<br/>offence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, setting guidelines for opinion polls for consistent and clear information being 
<br/>conveyed to the people of Fiji, especially voters, so the methodology of this particular polls can also be 
<br/>questioned to ensure that it is really what is claimed to be the opinion of people, not the wish of the entity 
<br/>or the person publishing the polls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, this applies to both sides of Parliament - we cannot and must not ever have our people, 
<br/></span><span>our Fijian people, misled and misguided in the choices that they make.  Misleading and misguidance has 
<br/></span><span>become a trait on the other side, Sir, and I have witnessed it right through from 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendments also provide for an appeal if a person is aggrieved but the decision of the SoE.  
<br/>Appeal must be made to the Electoral Commission within 14 days from the decision date of that SoE.  
<br/>There are very practical amendments to the Electoral Act, particularly in the operations of the FEO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few words, I wholehearted support Bill No. 49 of 2022 to amend the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral Act 2014 before this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion in front of us on 
<br/>the Electoral Amendment Bill, Bill No. 49 of 2022.  Sir, we have a big problem.  As we reach this juncture 
<br/>in our history, in our preparation for the Elections, we have a big issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had touched on the statement by the Fiji Law Society and the Australian Law Council and 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  has  mentioned  some  issues  with  that  and  Australia  Law  Council,  the 
<br/>Honourable Attorney-General has mentioned some of the his issues with that. So, the question here is, 
<br/>who  do  we  believe?  That  is  also  for  the  public.  Who  does  the  public  believe?  Do  we  believe  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Attorney-General or the Law Societies? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We need the facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Because, obviously, they made this statement based on their analysis 
<br/>of the legislation.  They would not be making these statements out of thin air. They have explained the 
<br/>legislation, we do acknowledge that, but they have also made the statements accordingly to the reading 
<br/>of the legislation. That is the fundamental question we face. For me, I believe the Law Societies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We need the facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Not only myself but also the majority of the people of this nation. 
<br/>Why would the Law Council of Australia and Fiji Law Society put their credibility on the line if they do 
<br/>it and knowing that it is misleading or false?  Why would they do such a thing they would not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the Government paying their Public Relations Consultants - Qorvis.  Why do they not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do a survey and ask that question, who do you believe the Law Societies or the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- We believe in facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Well, believe the facts but the facts according to who? That is what 
<br/>we  are  trying  to  determine  here  because  the  facts  are  not  according  to  the  Government  nor  to  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, it is according to neutral analysis and that is what the Law Societies are 
<br/>providing. Going back to my original question, do we have a big problem right now?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Who is the problem?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2006 up to now with the political constitutional framework that was have imposed by your 
<br/>Government - the FijiFirst Government and is what we are working under now, that is the fundamental 
<br/>problem that we are facing today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the discussions that we are having today, the problem identified is the SoE. That is the main 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- You are the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- If the political parties do not have confidence in him, how can we 
<br/>have a free and fair elections?  That is the question we have right now.  It is an issue of confidence from 
<br/>the political parties with the SoE and we need to deal with that issue. It cannot be swept under the carpet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, I saw him talking on the television and he was talking like a Member of Parliament at 
<br/>our level. He is unelected but he is talking like that.  Who is giving him the confidence to do that? The 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  must  first  address  and  resolve  the  controversial  and  scandalous 
<br/>reappointment of the incumbent SoE, Mr. Mohammed Saneem, who will have the final responsibility of 
<br/>administrating these proposed amendments and the country’s electoral roll as a whole, particularly in 
<br/>view  of  his  conviction  by  the  High  Court  for  gross  insubordination  associated  with  his  conduct  and 
<br/>management of the 2014 General Elections.  His conduct and unsatisfactory performance has, again, 
<br/></span><span>come under the spotlight in relation to the former Member of Parliament, Mr. Niko Nawaikula’s court 
<br/></span><span>case, and he is also implicated in a case involving the Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member  is, again, reading from 
<br/>someone’s statement.  The SoE is never convicted by a Court of Law. He must know what he is reading. 
<br/>He is not convicted and I challenge you to read it outside Parliament.  Do not hide behind Parliament 
<br/>Privilege and say that he was convicted by a Court of Law.  Please, say that outside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take note of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Given his gross subordination, the Attorney-General’s Office has 
<br/>not taken any action.  An appeal was supposed to have been made, lodged, but nothing.  So, that is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>2306 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue  and  it  is  evidently  clear  that  the  incumbent  SoE  is  being  given  preferential  treatment  by  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, compared to the CEO of the Bureau of Statisticians who was given the 
<br/>marching orders for revealing the truth on ethnic data.  The people are owed an urgent explanation of this 
<br/>scandalous situation and appointment, and given the lack of confidence, we are calling for his removal 
<br/>so that we have a free and fair election.  That is what we are insisting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- When we look at the amendments here, there is an issue about the 
<br/>ballot paper, they lifted it up today, they carried it in unceremonious manner as usual.  So, the question 
<br/>is, why allow so many political parties? What is the motive behind that?  Is it a deliberate ploy by the 
<br/>SoE and the honourable Attorney-General to create so many political parties and divert votes away?  That 
<br/>is an issue, so we question the motives of all these things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we  have heard from the other  side is  conspiracy.    They  accuse us of being  conspiracy 
<br/>theorists all the time and he is labelling the Law Societies as a cabal of people, doing the assessment and 
<br/></span><span>making these releases.  I mean, that is also a mind which is thinking of others as conspiring against him.  
<br/></span><span>No one is conspiring against him, they are making their own professional assessments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General seems to be offended by the word </span><span>‘lewenivanua’ </span><span>as used by 
<br/>honourable Gavoka. I wonder why he is opposed to the use of that indigenous word?  That is part and 
<br/>partial of our discourse, so do not be offended or be opposed to such words.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport  mentioned that these 
<br/>Elections - 2014 and 2018, are the most freest and most democratic.  Come on, he must be joking because 
<br/>the  elections  methodology  in  the  Constitution  is  imposed  by  the  2013  Constitution  which  no  one 
<br/>approved.  The people did not approve it.  There was no Constitutional Review Commission.  It was just 
<br/>formulated by a few people, we do not know who.  That was imposed on the nation.  How can that be 
<br/>free and democratic when the free and democratic methodology of elections in the 1997 Constitution was 
<br/>the one which was the product of a Constitution Review Commission where all the people participated?  
<br/>However, this Constitution is the total opposite.  So, you cannot say that, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister also labelled this side of Parliament as “parrots”.  Parrots are known for 
<br/>repeating whatever the owner is saying.  If you compare this side of Parliament and that side, which side 
<br/></span><span>has more parrots, this side or that side?  The answer is obvious, and the people know the answer to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  the  election  methodology  that  is  the  most  free  and  democratic  election.    Honourable 
<br/>Members on that side of the Parliament should not say that because the honourable Prime Minister carried 
<br/>a lot of them in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  brief.    Firstly,  this  Bill  shows 
<br/>desperateness.  It may boil down to the SoE’s decision.  I will come to that later on.  This Bills here shows 
<br/>to win by hook or by crook.  We must watch and be aware of that.  It is a draconian law, similar to those 
<br/>22 draconian Decrees.  It strangles the individuals, it strangles the public, it strangles the political parties 
<br/>(I will come back to that later).  We will do it, we will do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this should be referred to the Committee for consultation and full discussion 
<br/>with all concerned.  Let the people decide.  This boils down to who will win, by SOE’s decision in the 
<br/>next election because the wellbeing of the people should rest with the people in election; not with the 
<br/>Military but in the Constitution.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2307 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I know that, I am telling you. The wellbeing is in the Military but in 
<br/>reality it should be with the people through election.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the eve of elections, it is still 
<br/>going on – the amendments to the electoral roll. It happened in 2018 – they were still busy doing this and 
<br/>that, they forgot to get all the rolls to the polling venues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is getting worse.  I refer to 
<br/>3(6) of the Principal Act (1C)(a): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In  the  case  of  a  natural  person,  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $50,000  or  a  term  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, to me the $50,000 is too much for a person.  The laws we make should build 
<br/>people up, but here it condemns people.  Also for the other legal entities of $500,000 for political party - 
<br/>that will kill that political party.  It is important that the laws that we make and the penalties that we put 
<br/>in place should build people up rather than condemn.  This is one of the condemning legislations that 
<br/>come up here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 6 Principal Act, 110A (1): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Pursuant  to  section  3(1)(h),  the  Electoral  Commission    must  adopt  and  publish 
<br/>guidelines on opinion polls,  surveys or research related to elections as it deems fit for the 
<br/>orderly conduct of free and fair elections”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The people doing opinion polls are experts in that field and they know the periphery of how they 
<br/>should work and what they publish is the people’s opinion.  It is just an opinion, it is not the truth.  Maybe 
<br/>it will reflect the truth but it just an opinion and we should give them the liberty to do their work freely, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Here it says that the guidelines should be made by the Electoral Commission, where is 
<br/>the guideline?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why we are proposing that this goes to the Committee so they can get the guidelines there, 
<br/>and  they  can have  a look at it  and comment  on the  guidelines. Also it  will  strangle the opinion poll 
<br/>agencies, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is important that the rules or laws that we make, builds things up rather 
<br/>than condemn.  It is also talking about rules and the guidelines - that needs to be made clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, 110A (7) “ The decision of the Electoral Commission on an appeal is final and 
<br/>is not subject to any further appeal to or review by any court, tribunal or other adjudicating body”, this is 
<br/></span><span>dangerous, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We have the Commission, we have the Minister for Election but he is the 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Economy in-charge of the Commission and should be independent, but he can impose his 
<br/>authority there, the Supervisor of Elections is the Secretary for the Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the honourable Bulanauca obviously does not know what 
<br/>he is talking about. The Constitution says that the Electoral Commission is an independent body.  Every 
<br/>single independent body, whether it is to do with the Rotuma Council, whether it is to do with any other 
<br/>DPP’s Office any independent body has what we call a line Minister.  It does not mean that the Minister 
<br/>runs that particular organisation - it is for budgetary purposes. He knows that.  He has been a Minister 
<br/>himself, one would think he has never been one but Electoral Commission’s independence is guaranteed 
<br/>under the Constitution, so is the Fijian Election Office.  He should withdraw that comment.

<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member take note of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- That may be withdrawn, but in practice that is what the public has 
<br/>seen.  I am just saying what the public are saying.  It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to let me correct 
<br/>that… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order!  Mr. Speaker, Sir public has seen what?  Seen?  
<br/>How  has  the  Minister  interfered  with  the  independence  with  Electoral  Commission?    How  has  the 
<br/>Minister interfered with the independence of the Fijian Elections Office?  What have they seen?  Again 
<br/>he is going down that path, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take note of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- It is important that the appeal should be heard by the court.  That is 
<br/>what I am saying.  Here, it says, the decision of Electoral Commission is final.  It should be referred to a 
<br/>court.  That is the independency of the judiciary - the separation of powers there - not under the same 
<br/>Commission  and  Minister  for  Election,  supervisor  being  the  secretary  and  the  SOE  again  who  has 
<br/>implemented all this and then making the final decision, so on and so forth.  That is what my point is.  
<br/></span><span>For any decision made, the appellant should appeal to any court, outside the Electoral Commission.  That 
<br/></span><span>is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here in 2.6 (5), it says:  “…to consider the practicality of the operations in order to approve the 
<br/>best  means  for  transparent,  safe  and  variable  mechanism  to  transport  ballot  material  from  polling 
<br/>stations.”  - the sample was seen here.  That is common sense.  If there is a change, you change the way 
<br/>you are transporting, boxing, parceling it and the way you take it away.  As long as, none is lost along the 
<br/>way and reconciliation is carried out at the destination.  It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to note that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I will say that this is dictatorial governance - trying to control everything.  It is important 
<br/>that the well-being of the people should only be left to the people rather than to the military under the 
<br/>Constitution, which we do not agree with.  A Committee could discuss this with the public, the people 
<br/>and the stakeholders concerned like the Law Society.  The individuals and so on who can be affected 
<br/>need to have their input into the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This election should not be rigged - we are already rigging the process up to now including this 
<br/>Bill.  We must warn that we must not rig this election, particularly in the counting, in the legal process.  
<br/>We must ensure that the counting place is forbidden from everyone else and I beg and plead with the 
<br/></span><span>police and the military to watch this, and ensure that no one interferes with the counting, particularly not 
<br/></span><span>to stop the counting  every  night,  be it  for six hours, eight  hours or twelve  hours  -  counting must be 
<br/>completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important and my plea to the police and the military, having the role of seeing to the well-
<br/>being of the people here, to ensure that the counting is fair, the election is fair and that justice prevails.  It 
<br/>is  important  to  note  that.    As  I  said,  this  particular  Bill  strangles  like  the  Surfing  Decree,  like  the 
<br/>Mahogany Decree - it strangles the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.  Any decisions made, you cannot complain against.  
<br/>You can complain, but it will not be heard by any court of law.  The Registrar will just take it and put it 
<br/>in the rubbish bin.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here again, the same thing, I mean the Commission only.  The court should be the final judge.  
<br/>Here again they are not only strangling the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people in the mahogany and the surfing areas (or the 
<br/></span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners), they are strangling the public, the whole public of Fiji in the way they should operate.  
<br/>It is important to think properly and get them discussed widely first before bringing it here.  We can pass 
<br/>it after it has gone around and the public have given their comments, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I mentioned the other day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude - life after electricity is good because 
<br/>darkness will be gone.  You can see clearly what we could not see, what had been hidden.  Life after 
<br/>elections will be the same.  The dark motives (the spots) will go away and any hidden thing will be 
<br/>revealed.  The truth will come out and we will be there.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would just want to reiterate, 
<br/>again, for the benefit of Members of the other side, the exact provision in the amendment that they are 
<br/>objecting to, has been in the Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures) Act since 
<br/>2013.  Exactly the same provision and I wish to read it out again.  Under Section 26A, it says:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding the generality of subsection (1), if the Registrar has reason to believe 
<br/>that  a  person  has  information  or  relevant  document  to  or  required  by  the  Registrar  for  the 
<br/>performance of his or her duties under this Act, the Registrar may by notice in writing, direct 
<br/>the person to furnish such information or documents to the Registrar.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exactly the same provision.  The Registrar in this case is also the Supervisor of Elections.  It has 
<br/>been nine years since this provision has been put in place.  Did the FLS ever come up and say this is 
<br/>affecting privilege?  Did the Law Council of Australia come up and say it is affecting the civil rights of 
<br/></span><span>people?  Did SODELPA come up and say it is affecting the rights of the people of this country?  Did NFP 
<br/></span><span>come up and say that?   It has been there for nine years.  Exactly the same provision.  What is the difference 
<br/>between that provision and this provision?  None!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only difference is this, it is that the Opposition is now trying to make this into a political 
<br/>issue.  They know full well, Sir, that they will lose at the next elections and they are trying to make 
<br/>excuses to say it is not free and fair and credible.  Fundamentally that is what it is because from a purely 
<br/>legal  perspective,  there  is  no  difference.    Nobody,  no  lawyers’  rights  regarding  privilege  has  been 
<br/>affected.  No one’s privacy has been affected, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  None whatsoever.  Same provision, so 
<br/>how come they have suddenly woken up.  But even if they woke up, which they have not, but even if 
<br/>they woke up for example, it does not make any difference.  You cannot answer that.  This is why the 
<br/>FLS analysis is shambolic.  It should be put in the rubbish tin because they exactly have not covered that 
<br/>ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have not referred to all the other laws that exist and this is why we are saying, if they talk 
<br/>about accountability - I would love to find out how many people did Wylie Clarke consult in putting out 
<br/>this statement.  You can go and ask the lawyers in the Western Division.  Remember one thing, not all 
<br/>the lawyers in Fiji are members of the FLS.  It is a choice.  They can join or not join.  And the Law 
<br/></span><span>Council of Australia, if you read their words too, Mr. Speaker, Sir (the Opposition does not know how to 
<br/></span><span>read), they have said if this has happened then it may be this way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would appear, it would appear, is it not.  Is it yes or no?  It would appear because they are just 
<br/>simply piggybacking on what the Law Society has said.  There is no right of appeal against the decision 
<br/>by the SoE other than that to the Fiji Electoral Commission which is final and cannot be further appealed 
<br/>or reviewed by an Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me give you another revelation honourable Members from the other side.  Did you bother to 
<br/>read the Act, did Wylie Clark bother to read the Act.  I have got the Electoral Act here, it says on Section 
<br/>8 honourable Gavoka, read this,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In the performance of his or her functions and the exercise of his or her powers, the 
<br/>Supervisor is not subject to the direction or control by any person, except that he or she must 
<br/>comply with—  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>2310 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the directions or instructions that the Electoral Commission gives him or her concerning 
<br/>the performance of his or her functions; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a decision of a court of law exercising its jurisdiction in relation to a question on whether 
<br/>he or she has performed the functions or exercised the powers in accordance with the 
<br/>Constitution and the law (which is this law and he can only act within the confines of 
<br/>this of this law), or whether he or she should or should not perform those functions or 
<br/>exercise those powers.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What it simply means Sir, is that if the Supervisor of Elections goes outside the ambit of the law, 
<br/>if he decides tomorrow to follow honourable Lalabalavu and find out which places in Suva he visits at 
<br/>night, that is going outside of the ambit of the law.  That is affecting his privacy, who he is meeting not 
<br/>meeting, that is affecting his privacy.  That is not within the ambit of the law.  So he can challenge that, 
<br/>he is saying he can take him to a court of law and say “you are acting outside the ambit of the law”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Law Society does not even mention Section 8.  The Law Council of Australia did not not 
<br/>even look at Section 8.  SODELPA did not look at section 8, honourable Members of NFP did not look 
<br/>at section 8.  So  how can  you trust  any  sort  of analysis  by these organisations.  The  entire thesis  of 
<br/></span><span>SODELPA and NFP has been reliance on the FLS assessment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  find  it  quite  incredible  as  we  have  said  before  on  several  occasions,  the 
<br/>honourable Members and someone said from outside also, I cannot remember which honourable Member 
<br/>has said, that they feel they have to object to everything just because we have said it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the sake of rejection, honourable Tuisawau who has been here for nearly four years, whenever 
<br/>he feels like it, he says this Constitution is illegal - if he is a man of principal and indeed an honourable 
<br/>Member  he  would  leave  Parliament.    He  would  leave  Parliament  because  it  is  under  this  very 
<br/>Constitution,  under this very  electoral system that  he  is sitting where he is  sitting today.    If  he is  so 
<br/>principally aggrieved by it, he should not have ever participated in that.  That goes to show that he is not 
<br/>a person of principal, because if he is saying that this is illegal you should be thrown out, he should not 
<br/>have come under this system into this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I think he needs to be clear, he is mixing the issues.  We came into 
<br/></span><span>the Parliament through the election system in the Constitution that is fine, but while in the House, I do 
<br/>not have to agree with Constitution so it does not mean that I have to go out because you did not bring 
<br/>me here, I was elected by my voters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- So, you have no right to tell me to go out.  If you want to go out, you 
<br/>go out yourself because you cannot tell me to go out because you did not put me here.  You were put 
<br/>there by your voters and I was put here by the voters so that is it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this is the level of understanding this honourable Member 
<br/>has, that is my point.  I am not going to go because I believe in this electoral system, you do not but you 
<br/>missed the point. The voters only voted for you under this system, under this Constitution.  That is the 
<br/>point.  He missed it but obviously we cannot go on about that because obviously we have to recognise 
<br/>everyone’s limitations Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2311 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  the  other  point  that  really  flabbergasted  me  Sir,  and  I  do  not  use  the  word  lightly,  the 
<br/>honourable Member in his desperation berated this, “oh, why is the ballot paper so big? Why have so 
<br/>many candidates?” He said, “Why did you not stop?” All these political parties are being formed?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, under Section 23 of the Constitution it says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“23.  (1) Every citizen has the freedom to make political choices, and the right to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>form or join a political party; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a) 
<br/>(b)   participate in the activities of, or recruit members for, a political party; and 
<br/>(c)   campaign for a political party candidate or cause.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every citizen has a right to form a political party. That is their political right. It is a fundamental 
<br/>political right.  The International Conventional of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) assures every citizen 
<br/>of the right to form a political party and today just to suit his narrative, he is saying we should stop people 
<br/>from forming political parties.  Why should we? Because they are frightened of their votes been taken 
<br/>away?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- They are saying, “yeah”.  Why? That is your tough luck.  You 
<br/>want the vote, you go and campaign. You have policies that will appeal to people. We cannot therefore 
<br/>stop anyone from forming a political party. If there are 10 political parties being formed, if tomorrow 
<br/>there will be 20, the day after that may be five, that is the choice of the Fijian people and here they are, 
<br/>they stand up and talk about the lack of democracy when they are fundamentally undermining a basic 
<br/>principle of democracy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Fundamentally, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 24 of the Constitution says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“24.  (1)  Every person has the right to personal privacy, which includes the right to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>confidentiality of their personal information; 
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>confidentiality of their communications; and  
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>respect for the private and family life.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know how they treat private and family life, what they do on social media.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the 
<br/>extent that it is necessary, a law may limit or may authorised the limitation or the right set out in subsection 
<br/>(1). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other provision, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to also read out in the Constitution which is 
<br/>what we are following, it says and this is why I object to what honourable Gavoka always goes on about 
<br/>and honourable Tuisawau on those rare occasions actually supporting honourable Gavoka, it says, “All 
<br/>citizens of Fiji shall be known as Fijians” - that is why we say that.  It is there in the Constitution, Section 
<br/>5(1). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue that we like to highlight also, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua in the usual NFP 
<br/>style makes comments and then disappears. She said and I want to correct her factually and I hope all of 
<br/>you have the Fijian Elections Office application, have it on your phones rather than </span><span>Facebook</span><span>.  You will

<div><span>see,  Sir,  that  Nasauvakarua  is  actually  a  polling  station.    The  people  of  Nasauvakarua  vote  in  the 
<br/>Nasauvakarua Community Hall. The code of the polling venue is W2299019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Another lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  She  stood  up  and  said  that  there  is  no  polling  venue.  The 
<br/>community hall is the polling venue for the people of Nasauvakarua.  Unfortunately she has disappeared. 
<br/>Hopefully she is watching from somewhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She also mentioned that we should have passed a law to say that the bus fare will be free on the 
<br/>day of elections.  You do not need a law to say that. The Elections Office are already working with the 
<br/>bus companies. There are already discussions. You do not need the law to come to Parliament to say to 
<br/>make it free.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They went on about political party donations. New Zealand is already in the process of amending 
<br/>its laws to tighten donation laws. They want to make their amount smaller. They want to restrict the 
<br/>amounts of money coming from overseas.  Honourable Seruiratu already has this article if you want to 
<br/>see it afterwards. It was published in the newspapers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also was very taken aback, honourable Qereqeretabua who is not here again, 
<br/>a couple of fallacies, and I wish she says this outside Parliament.  She said that the bench chose witnesses 
<br/>in one of the cases, that the Judges chose the witnesses.  That is actually contempt.  She also said that in 
<br/>regards to some people who have taken the matter to the court about the name change, she said the matter 
<br/>is the name change, she said the matter is </span><span>sub judice</span><span>, but even if the Writ is issued, the seven women 
<br/>plaintiffs will not receive justice.  Who is she to say that? She is basically saying that the Judiciary in Fiji 
<br/>is corrupt and I challenge her, Sir, do not hide between Parliamentary privilege, to please make those 
<br/>comments outside Parliament because we have to protect the Judiciary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The three arms of the State have to be protected in the same way we protect the Legislature, in 
<br/>the same way we protect the Executive, we will protect the Judiciary also.  They come here and make 
<br/>these fallacious comments in their political desperation.  We have said this continuously.  For political 
<br/>mileage, they have continuously sought to undermine institutions whenever they feel like it.  That is not 
<br/>very leadership like, that is not very statesmen, stateswomen like, only for your political ascendancy you 
<br/>want to do that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they also went to say, “FijiFirst has not been referred to FICAC.”  We go to 
<br/></span><span>great lengths to ensure we comply with the laws, we go to great amounts of money we spend to make 
<br/></span><span>sure every single product of ours is labelled, all our advertisements are labelled, we follow the laws, we 
<br/>spend money and we spend hours to do that.  If they cannot bother to do that, of course, they will be 
<br/>reported.  Not to FICAC, we lodge a complaint with the Fijian Elections Office then they do their thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lalabalavu, I understand said that we reported </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> to FICAC.  We cannot report 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Sun </span><span>to FICAC, we have complained about </span><span>Fiji Sun </span><span>to the Fijian Elections Office.  What it does, they 
<br/>will do.  We can only raise those matters with the authorities and the authority in this particular case is 
<br/>the Fijian Elections Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they said because we do not like the polls.  I know certain SODELPA Members 
<br/>including honourable  Gavoka have been  aggrieved by the poll results.  Everyone  has questioned  the 
<br/>manner in which they have gone and ascertained that information, we are the only ones with the intestinal 
<br/>fortitude (guts) to be able to take these things up even though you call </span><span>Fiji Sun </span><span>our newspaper which is 
<br/>not, but we believe the law should apply to everyone.  Everyone should adhere to the same standards.  
<br/>What is this law trying to do?  It is saying that international standards of polling should be adhered to.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2313 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is wrong with that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The standards that the Electoral Commission has adopted is what is used in Europe and various 
<br/>other  countries;  what  is  wrong  with  that?    It  is  not  only  about  us,  it  is  about  all  political  parties  as 
<br/>honourable Koya has said.  We know some of you aggrieved, we know NFP is aggrieved by that but they 
<br/>do not have the intestinal fortitude to come out and say that.  We have that and that is the difference 
<br/>between us and them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Tuisawau again; his logic.  He went on and said that because we do 
<br/>not like the Supervisor of Elections, therefore the elections will not be credible.  What logic is that?  Just 
<br/>because you do not like it as a political party therefore the election will not be credible?  We have had 
<br/>two international observer groups for the past two elections, co-chaired by Australia, Indonesia, India, 
<br/>other countries were invited and they joined.  I think about 13 or 14 countries had observers.  They have 
<br/>all held the elections to be credible and fair.  They have all recognised the enormous amount of work that 
<br/>has been carried out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Qereqeretabua  like  the  other  day,  she  singled-out  honourable  Vijay  Nath  as  the 
<br/>Chairman of the Committee (just personally attacked him), she today spent nearly three quarters of her 
<br/></span><span>submission, her statement attacking, calling the Supervisor of Elections all sorts of names (personally 
<br/></span><span>attacking him).  Yet on the other hand, international organisations, our development partners is taking 
<br/>this man overseas saying, “use this what they have done in Fiji as an example to what you should do in 
<br/>your country.”  They recently went to the Australian Elections; him and the Chairman of the Electoral 
<br/>Commission.  They do not publicise these things.  He has been used as an observer in other countries, 
<br/>they do not look at that.  Where is the logic in this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on about the 2006 Elections.  I have said this in Parliament before.  A 
<br/>voter turnout in Cakaudrove over 101 percent in the 2006 Elections; the European Union Report says 
<br/>that.    In  other  words  there  were  more  votes  in  the  ballot  boxes  than  the  number  of  voters  in  that 
<br/>constituency.  That is credible elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gerrymandering of constituencies, in the old constitution we had what we call “exclusive </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>seats”.  In Namosi, 3,300 people elects one candidate, Nadroga with 19,000 people elects one candidate, 
<br/>where is the equality – no equality.  That is what you call “gerrymandering”. In some countries it would 
<br/>be illegal, certain parts in Fiji, polling stations were not opened on time.  The first day of the polls, the 
<br/>honourable Karavaki then or the Supervisor of Elections had disappeared, he was not there because he 
<br/>said, “I Sabbath on Saturday, I cannot be there” - so many irregularities.  In those days we had three 
<br/></span><span>counting  stations  only  in  Fiji  -  Labasa  College  for  the  Northern  Division,  Lautoka  for  the  Western 
<br/></span><span>Division and Suva Grammar School for the Central Division.  What happened in 2006, the EU Report 
<br/>actually highlights that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Normally if a ballot box, say for example, is coming from Naitasiri, the box will go in the truck 
<br/>with the Police, go all the way to Suva Grammar School and they empty the ballot papers there and they 
<br/>count it.  Guess what happened in 2016? They had a half way clearing house in Flagstaff, I still know the 
<br/>property.  They hired it for some odd reason where ballot boxes went to the half way clearing house, God 
<br/>knows that happened there and then they went to Suva Grammar School. Why did they need a half way 
<br/>cleaning house? Why do you need that?   Where there were no polling agents available, there were no 
<br/>political party representatives available, they were not allowed there, they were only allowed at Suva 
<br/>Grammar School. There, the shenanigans took place, no such shenanigans took place in 2014 and 2018.  
<br/>They stand up here as if they have got some high moral ground; they have zero, no moral ground.

<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hogwash!

<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- What hogwash?  Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, even if we threw all the facts in their face, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will still say “hogwash”.  That is the level of desperation they have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to make, honourable Gavoka said, “oh, we cannot rely 
<br/>on his analysis because it is known to be wrong, various laws”. No.  There have been typos where we 
<br/>had the guts to come back to Parliament and say that the type setting errors have been taken into account, 
<br/>we want  to  amend it, but never  anything  wrong with the  substantial law or  the  principal  of the law.  
<br/>Honourable Gavoka that is a real cheap shot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last but not least, with alot has been said and I wanted to refer to the NFP post 
<br/>by honourable Professor Prasad.  This is the level of desperation to justify his political machinations, his 
<br/>political choices using the late Jai Ram Reddy.  He said, “The late Jai Ram Reddy understood the security 
<br/>of Indo-Fijians lay in a meaningful relationship with the indigenous people.” What a cheap shot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, using Jai Ram Reddy to justify his alliance with Rabuka and everyone knows 
<br/>that under this Prime Minister, every citizen irrespective of ethnicity, irrespective of whether they live in 
<br/></span><span>maritime or rural areas , irrespective whether they live in Cakaudrove or live in Ba everyone has been 
<br/></span><span>treated equally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I also wish to make and this is 
<br/>why I objected to certain stereotyping that takes place. When you lump people together in ethnicity, you 
<br/>do not recognise the injustices that take place within that group.  With Indo-Fijians, with </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> if we 
<br/>are going to lump them together, within them there are differences; there are rich  ones, there are poor 
<br/>ones, there are connected ones, there are women, there are disable people, there are maritime people, 
<br/>there are rural people, there are the  youth. So as a good leader, as a good political party,  you would 
<br/>recognise that.  That is why we believe in common equal citizenry.  This is going back to those days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talked about what Jai Ram Reddy did, I know Jai Ram Reddy, I know people who were 
<br/>involved in the Reeves Commission. The Reeves Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, said there should be 
<br/>more  open  seats,  less  communal  seats  but  there  is  a  Joint  Parliamentary  Select  Committee  in  which 
<br/>Rabuka did not relent.  He said “No, we must have more communal seats” and that is why we had the 
<br/>1997 Constitution.  Honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu may be aware of that.  That man sitting in the 
<br/></span><span>gallery was part of the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee, I have the report myself where they were 
<br/></span><span>comprising.  Therefore Jai Ram Reddy knew that there was no other way out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He knew that because if you read all of Jai Ram Reddy’s literature, all his speeches, he always 
<br/>talked about common equal citizenry like A.D. Patel and Siddiq Koya did.  But he saw that as a pathway 
<br/>of getting there, not to be caught in a time warp like what they are trying to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not least, honourable Bulanauca was the one who called Jai Ram Reddy a </span><span>tevoro</span><span>.  He 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>singled him out because he said he is the head of the Judiciary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I already made my explanations, there is no need to repeat it , Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2315 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he did, he is not denying that, he did call him 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a “</span><span>tevoro”</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  all  of these, the  reason why  I  raised these issues is because  I  wanted  to  highlight that the 
<br/>contributions to the Bills today have been all tainted as far as the Opposition is concerned by political 
<br/>considerations, not about the law itself.   As highlighted, I was not being dramatic, but I just wanted to 
<br/>show the honourable Members the practical reasons as to why we need to amend the law, we have ballot 
<br/>papers that big.  It cannot fit into those ballot boxes.  We need to physically change those ballot boxes, 
<br/>we need to carry those ballot papers, we have human beings that will have to carry them and we cannot 
<br/>have ballot boxes weighing more than 12.5 kilogrammes, we need to make it easier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir it is absolutely correct, there are polling stations in the rural areas, this place that 
<br/>I just highlighted, Nasauvakarua.  One place you have to cross the river 13 times or 12 times to get there.  
<br/>We need to make it easier for them, we need the officials going to conduct this election easier for them.  
<br/>These are the practical reasons as to why these amendments have been brought about.  There is absolutely 
<br/>no assault on anyone’s civil rights, there is no assault on legal professional privilege, there is no assault 
<br/></span><span>on privacy.  All of these provisions have been there and this is why I recommend that we support this 
<br/></span><span>Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote.
