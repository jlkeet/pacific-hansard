<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI ROADS AUTHORITY 2016 – 2018 ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Fiji Roads Authority 2017/2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 2016/2017 Annual Report which was tabled on 11 May 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  (FRA)  is  the  organization 
<br/>responsible  for  planning,  developing,  and  maintaining  Fiji’s  $11  billion  road  infrastructure.    The 
<br/>infrastructure primarily consists of approximately 6,377 kilometres of road, 1,200 bridges, 9000 plus 
<br/>streetlights and 47 jetties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FRA operates as a body corporate governed under the leadership of a board. FRA manages the 
<br/>roading assets primarily through out-sourced contracts with the private sector.  The core element of this 
<br/>infrastructure is the road network.  It provides the means for the movement of people and goods between 
<br/>businesses and local and international markets.  Roads enable people to get to jobs, education and health 
<br/>facilities.  Without reliable transport these vital connections will remain fragile and Fiji’s development 
<br/>will be constrained.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the scrutiny  of the  FRA  Annual Reports, the Committee conducted  a  site visit to the 
<br/>Vatunibale  Depot,  Labasa Office  and held discussions  with the  FRA Chief Executive Officer on the 
<br/>Authority’s operations and capital projects especially those that will be undertaken to address flooding 
<br/>and subsequent damage to the roading infrastructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the 2016/2017 period, a number of bridges and crossing were successfully completed 
<br/>despite the continuing of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  The major highlight for the Authority was the opening of Coqeloa 
<br/>Bridge in Labasa which was completed five months ahead of schedule. Other major highlights for FRA 
<br/>included the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Completion of Nabena crossing at Matailobau District in Naitasiri; 
<br/>Completion of new Lomawai Bridge in Sigatoka; 
<br/>Completion of Vunivaivai  Bridge in Nakelo Tailevu; and 
<br/>Completion of new Savu 6 bridge in Naitasiri. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, in the 2017/2018 financial year, a number of bridges were successfully completed.  
<br/>The major highlights of the Authority were the completion and opening of the Stinson Parade Bridge and 
<br/>Vatuwaqa Bridge opening.  Other major highlights for FRA included the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>

<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Completion of the Levuka Market Bridge; 
<br/>Opening of the Naisogo Bridge in Levuka; 
<br/>Repairs of jetties in Bau, Cicia, Lakeba and other small islands; 
<br/>Crossing repairs and maintenance in Savusavu, Nausori and other parts of Fiji; 
<br/>Repairs of critically damaged bridges such as Matainavuso Bridge, Tamavua; and  
<br/>Renewal and replacements of crossings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I will be very brief. As I have indicated on many occasions, we need to 
<br/>do  the  small  things  properly  with  the  roads  in  Fiji  today.  Indeed  it  is  part  of  our  way  forward  for 
<br/>SODELPA to focus on items like road humps, road signages, potholes - all these things are very important 
<br/>to the overall scheme of things when you talk about your transportation system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we speak, Mr. Speaker, I was in the West yesterday and the honourable Minister for Tourism 
<br/>was highlighting the resurgence of tourism over the last two days.  He should go and see the public road 
<br/>leading to Shangri-La one of the premier resorts in Fiji. It is full of potholes. It is very shameful that the 
<br/>entrance  to  Shangri-La  is  in  that  condition.    You  know  I  am  ex-Shangri-La  and  if  it  was  left  to  the 
<br/>company we would have fixed it but it is a public road.  It is quite shocking that you allowed that to 
<br/>happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have said in the past that we will focus, we will have a committed team to travel the length 
<br/>of this country to fill up holes as soon as they emerge. You do not want to leave the hole uncovered 
<br/>overnight.  Most of the vehicles in Fiji are low cars like mine.  The vast majority of the cars here are low 
<br/>and when they hit potholes, it is very painful in terms of the cost of repairs and all that.  Something can 
<br/>be done very easily just to fill up the holes and then do them up later as opposed to leaving them open.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also spoke about the trenches. People dig trenches across the road.  I know people were laughing 
<br/>when I brought it up because it is in the village very next to mine. Silaevuevu. Someone dug a trench 
<br/>across  the  road  to  connect  something  which  is  fine  but  you  do  not  leave  it  open.  Now  you  go  to 
<br/>Rukurukulevu there is another trench there, and it has been there for months.  In Rewa Street - there is a 
<br/>trench across the street now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know, Sir, if someone wants to dig a trench across the road which is used by the public it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>must be supervised in a matter that once you dig the trench, you connect the services and you cover it 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>immediately.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do not let it be there, do not leave it open as we currently do today.  Again I say, it is very harmful 
<br/>to cars.  I have also spoken many times about the humps in Fiji.  If we can standardise them, we have all 
<br/>been to Australia and New Zealand, their humps are one standard, very gentle but they serve the purpose 
<br/>that they are there for.  We have that in Korovisilou right now - the humps are exactly what you want. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a  couple of weeks ago, they built two humps at the entrance to Navua Bridge 
<br/>so it is back to the old way where cars come down and they have to go sideways because they are low 
<br/>and these humps are too high.  Can we standardise them and bring up the quality of these things because 
<br/>it says a lot about the duty of care to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know they are doing a lot of work and we see the results of that but I think we are lacking 
<br/>attention to the small details which motorists like most us who drive low cars would welcome in terms 
<br/>of the quality of our roads.  That Mr. Speaker, Sir, was my contribution, thanks to the FRA for this Report 
<br/>and continue to drive home the point that we do the little things properly to really enhance the experience 
<br/>while motoring in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion that has been given by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Chairman and I would like to contribute to that debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, rural road development in Fiji has picked up at a fast pace and 
<br/>Government  is  increasingly  focusing  on  rural  roads.    This  is  because  we  know  that  there  are  many 
<br/>economic and social benefits offered by the rural roads. These roads are equally important as urban roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2016 to 2022, an additional 188 kilometres of rural roads was constructed.  Rural roads are 
<br/>often  considered  to  be  a  life-line  for  rural  communities.    They  play  an  important  role  in  poverty 
<br/>alleviation, enabled transportation, linking producers to markets, workers to jobs, students to schools and 
<br/>sick to hospitals as roads are vital to any development economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a total of around 11,000 kilometres of road in Fiji of which 6,400 
<br/>kilometre under the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) and the balance is categorised as community access road, 
<br/>farm access road, cane access road, logging road or private road.  For FRA the authority manages 4,600 
<br/>kilometres of sealed road and 1,800 kilometres of unsealed roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Constitution  provides  every  Fijian  with  socio-economic,  environmental 
<br/></span><span>rights, realisation of these rights is critical for inclusive sustainable development.  This empowers every 
<br/></span><span>Fijian through the provision of essential social services and other public goods.  Under Section 34 of the 
<br/>Fijian Constitution, all Fijians have the right to reasonable access to transportation.  This is further aligned 
<br/>to the 5-Year to 20-Year National Development Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has been taking various proactive steps to boost rural roads as they 
<br/>play a very important role in enhancing income opportunities for people who followed by other benefits.  
<br/>Why  construction  of  the  other  roads  is  important,  it  is  equally  important  to  develop  rural  roads.  
<br/>Government regards all Fijians as equally deserving of development, rural or urban; it is the same reason 
<br/>that the Fijian Government has increased its investments in the rural road development programmes over 
<br/>the years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past six years, Government through FRA has invested around FJ$43.9 
<br/>million on the construction of rural roads.  This has benefited around 94 communities.  Apart from these 
<br/>rural roads, a total of $113.8 million was directed towards the renewal and replacement of crossings and 
<br/>bridges.  This has enhanced connectivity for our rural to urban roads. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2335 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  information  of  the  House,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development through the Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF) Programme 
<br/>constructs community access roads in rural areas. In doing so, from 2018 to 2021, a total of 199 CARFF 
<br/>roads  were  constructed  amounting  to  $22.9  million,  benefiting  over  3,900  people.  This  has  not  only 
<br/>provided basic access, but also opened up these communities to other opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One may ask, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the benefits of investment to these rural roads are.  To name 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are few:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  offers  better  transportation  facilities,  rural  roads  contribute  significantly  by  creating 
<br/>linkages, thus increasing the opportunities to access goods and services located in nearby 
<br/>villages or major town and markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It boosts agricultural activities and productivity. Rural roads are essential for sustaining 
<br/>agricultural development also. A good network of rural roads can provide a boost to the 
<br/>agricultural  activities  by  timely  transportation  of  water,  seeds  and  other  raw  materials 
<br/>needed for farming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It improves mobility  and  saves time.  The  presence of roads in rural  areas increase the 
<br/></span><span>mobility of labour and materials.  Typically, rural roads can ensure shorter travel time, the 
<br/>time  saved  this  way  may  help  the  rural  poor  to  be  productive  and  generate  increased 
<br/>incomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It gives access to essential services, such as, health care and education.  Improved road 
<br/>connectivity can also enhance access of rural masses to education services. They can travel 
<br/>to  nearest  towns,  cities  and  get  better  and  higher  education  which  can  open  better 
<br/>employment opportunities for them.  In addition, they can also access quality healthcare 
<br/>medical services, such as maternity services, dental, physicians, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all governments in Fiji have been investing to some degree in rural roads. It is 
<br/>the Bainimarama-led Government or the FijiFirst Government have not only continued their focus, but 
<br/>also raised their focus to another level. It has continued to focus on the needs of the rural and maritime 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Fijian Constitution provides every Fijian with socio-economic and 
<br/>environmental rights.  The realisation of these rights is critical for inclusive and sustainable development. 
<br/></span><span>This empowers every Fijian through the provision of essential social services and other public goods.  Sir, 
<br/></span><span>under Section 34 of the Fijian Constitution, all Fijians have the right to reasonable access to transportation. 
<br/>This is further aligned to the 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has been taking various proactive steps to boost rural roads as they 
<br/>play  a  very  important  role  in  enhancing  community  opportunities  for  the  people,  followed  by  other 
<br/>benefits.  Why is the construction of urban roads important? It is equally important to develop rural roads.  
<br/>Government regards all Fijians as equally deserving of development, rural or urban. It is the same reason 
<br/>that the Fijian Government has increased its investments in the Rural Road Development Programmes 
<br/>over the years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Concluding remarks, and I want to reiterate, the Bainimarama-led Government or the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  have  not  only  continued  their  focus,  but  also  raised  their  focus  to  another  level.  It  has 
<br/>continued to focus on the needs of the rural and maritime communities.

<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijians connected.  A huge part of this process is managing bridges, street lights, traffic signals and jetties 
<br/>with locations spread out across thousands of kilometres of roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  FRA  is  doing  that  and  is  responsible  for  the  country’s  entire  surface.    They  do  the 
<br/>transportation networks, due to unprecedented funding, alterations in recent years had been massively 
<br/>expanded and upgraded to provide new levels of access for greater mobility to the Fijian people, as the 
<br/>network  that  connects  our  towns,  cities  to  domestic  and  international  ports  and  rural  and  maritime 
<br/>communities goods and services.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to fully support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a short contribution on the 
<br/>motion before Parliament. First of all I would like to thank the Committee for the work that they have 
<br/>done and the recommendations that they have provided.  Hopefully the relevant entity will take into 
<br/>consideration moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just comment on some of the issues that I have identified in the 2017-2018 Annual Report.  
<br/>Let me just start with the importance of the Annual Report will give us Members to see the progress of 
<br/>the activities that are being conducted by the FRA.  In these instances, the FRA was supposed to prepare 
<br/>the Annual Report according to its Act, within three months after the end of each financial year.  We are 
<br/></span><span>talking about 2017-2018 and now we are discussing it in 2022.  That is more than three months, if the 
<br/></span><span>Act is being adhered to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Act  states  that  the  Authority  shall  send  a  copy  of  the  Annual  Report  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister who shall  cause it to be laid before  the  Cabinet  as  soon as possible  and the Annual Report 
<br/>required shall contain amongst other things the audited statements, statement of financial performance 
<br/>and such information as required as a true and fair view of the financial affairs and auditor’s copy of the 
<br/>Auditor’s Report.   This is 2017-2018 and  we  are  discussing something which may  have progressed.  
<br/>Looking through the recommendations, I think the recommendations of the Committee are genuine in 
<br/>terms  of  addressing  real  and  relevant  issues  that  have  been  confronted  by  road  users,  pedestrians 
<br/>currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to refer to some notes that have been highlighted by the Auditor-General in the audit 
<br/>accounts  and  I  do  not  see  any  recommendations  that  are  relating  to  these  in  terms  of  commitments, 
<br/>contingent liabilities and contingent assets.  The Authority had a balance of $1.5 million in 2018, and this 
<br/>commitment and contingent liabilities are relating to termination of contract for professional engineering 
<br/>services advisor MWH.  The notes that have been put in there by the Auditor-General on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 
<br/>2016, the Authority Principal Engineering Services Provider, MWH had terminated their contract with 
<br/></span><span>the FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FRA has commenced proceedings against MWH in the High Court of Fiji in regards to the 
<br/>return of documents by MWH that FRA is entitled to under the contract.  The judgement was in favour 
<br/>of the Authority, however, MWH has appealed the decision and furthermore MWH has also commenced 
<br/>proceedings against FRA in the High Court of Fiji seeking to enforce its land entitlement to submit the 
<br/>disputes with FRA under the contract to mediation.  At the time of this Report, these cases were still 
<br/>pending in the High Court of Fiji for final judgement.  That is why I reiterated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 
<br/>Annual Report needs to be tabled on time and we hope to have an update from the relevant line Minister 
<br/>or the honourable Attorney-General to give us assurances whether something has transpired out of these 
<br/>final court judgements regarding this case.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also note that pictures of the old Rewa Bridge are still being shown here and I 
<br/>would like to enquire what is the status of dismantling the old Rewa Bridge.  Are they going to dismantle 
<br/>the old Rewa Bridge or are they going to allow the Nausori Town Council to probably have an extra 
<br/>income stream that they could explore in future.  I see that this has been an issue that has been addressed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Nausori Town Council.  This is something they have come to us when we enquired with them and we 
<br/>hope that we will come to a final decision on the old Rewa Bridge on whether it will be removed or not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the street lights.  I see that a lot of street lights have been 
<br/>pictured here in the Annual Report. Maybe the honourable Minister can consider putting up street lights 
<br/>on Princess Road up to Sawani, up to Nausori and probably up to Serea and Vunidawa areas.  That is 
<br/>something that probably the honourable Minister can highlight to us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the traffic congestions as has already been mentioned by the honourable 
<br/>Minister and the honourable Gavoka.  This is something that we continuously face and one of the major 
<br/>factors contributing to the congestion is the road works that has been carried out.  Maybe the honourable 
<br/>Minister can assist in enlightening the House, how these road works are going to be addressed to ensure 
<br/>that traffic congestion is assisted.  This is all that I can contribute to the motion and I support the motion 
<br/>before Parliament.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk on this motion.  
<br/>First of all I would like to thank the Committee for the work that it has done on the Report and its findings, 
<br/>very useful findings and also the recommendations that have been made in terms of the things that are in 
<br/></span><span>the Report.  Just to respond briefly to some of the issues that have been raised by the honourable Radrodro.  
<br/></span><span>The status  of the Annual Reports, I do not have the information with me now, the ongoing status of 
<br/>Annual Reports but that is something that we will hopefully respond to you at some time in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member had raised the issue about the court case that had been done by FRA 
<br/>and  MWH.    As  he  said,  the  appeal  is  in  place,  so  obviously  all  of  that  will  have  to  await  the  court 
<br/>judgement on that particular issue.  There is no way that we can move that ahead.  But at the end of the 
<br/>day, FRA is there to make sure that the consultants, whoever we use that they deliver the best for this 
<br/>country and that will always be FRA’s prime goal to make sure that happens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The questions on the Rewa Bridge.  The Rewa Bridge just similar to the bridge that we have in 
<br/>Sigatoka, ideally it needs to be removed.  Initially some of the estimates that I have seen, to remove this 
<br/>bridge amounts to figures in the vicinity of around $1 million because obviously the Rewa Bridge, if we 
<br/>are going to dismantle it, you cannot use trucks.  You cannot put a truck on that road to dismantle it.  You 
<br/>will need a barge to take things down and put it on another barge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At some time there was talk of a company doing it, not getting paid for it but doing it and then 
<br/>selling the scrap on their own but FRA is still looking at how they will try to address that issue so that the 
<br/></span><span>old bridge can be removed.  I notice the comments made by the honourable Member asking for street 
<br/></span><span>lights in Naitasiri. I am also a person raised in Naitasiri and I regard myself as a </span><span>kai</span><span> Naitasiri born and 
<br/>bred in Wakanisila, Kalabu in Naitasiri but when I look at street lights, we look at the policies for street 
<br/>lights all across Fiji.  Honourable Leawere is always asking me for street lights in Serua. The FRA will 
<br/>treat everyone equally; Naitasiri, Lau, maybe Kadavu in the future who knows, we treat everyone equally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also a question that was made about the road works; much of the road works leading 
<br/>to traffic congestion.  A lot of the road works are designed to address the traffic congestion. You will see 
<br/>a lot of the road works that are taking place now, it is ripping and remaking.  Ripping up the existing road, 
<br/>fixing it up so that we can have a better surface of the road to improve the traffic congestion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to talk very briefly on some of the very useful observations 
<br/>that were made by the Committee on Page 7, 3.1 on Traffic Congestion.  The auditor had emphasised 
<br/>importance of FRA looking at the local area on traffic management.  As I had mentioned in the previous 
<br/>paper, what are the biggest investments that we have seen of FRA over the past year and a half, has been 
<br/>to improve the surface of a lot of our roads; all over Suva to Levuka, everywhere you go, you see roads 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are being ripped up, the same materials are being used so we can enhance the surface of the road and 
<br/>when you have better roads, better surface of the road, this is going to speed up the traffic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, when you have too many road humps that slows down the traffic.  One of the things 
<br/>that I have notice over the past year or so, as a person that travels daily from Nakasi to Suva the important 
<br/>role that the Police are having.  Every morning, now they man all the traffic lights and that allows for the 
<br/>free-flow of traffic all cross the places that normally have a lot of traffic congestion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, currently there has  been a number of recommendations done here in this Audit Report about 
<br/>how to improve on the traffic congestion in the form of a good running surface, additional lanes, rerouting 
<br/>traffic, overpass at locations where they have a higher number of pedestrians, et cetera. Alot of these 
<br/>things, the improvement of the surface of the road is something that FRA is doing right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Things like overpasses and the other solutions that have been recommended are things that will 
<br/>be scheduled in over time.  Hopefully some of these will begin to extract from the new budget (Financial 
<br/>Year 2023-2024).  The other observation that was done at Page 7 was about the occurrence of slips at the 
<br/>Korosomo and Lomaloma roads.  These are both in Vanua Levu.  Lomaloma is when you cut across from 
<br/>Labasa to Savusavu, there is the big slip that has happened there and also in Korosomo that I think was 
<br/></span><span>either this year or last year, that was a big issue where that road sank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new alignment at Korosomo has now been competed so you have the alignment at the exact 
<br/>level as which it will take place.  But in the meantime, for Korosomo the new alignment has been cut to 
<br/>the  formation  level  and  the  new  pavement  construction  will  be  executed  once  we  have  the  budget 
<br/>constraints that still come in three phases because the economic downturn that we have faced these past 
<br/>two  years,  once  you  have  overcome  them,  then  we  will  begin  to  look  at  having  money  on  the  new 
<br/>Korosomo alignment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the meantime, the old alignment which sunk, in order to make sure that people are able to use 
<br/>their traffic daily, they filled it in again and at the moment since it is a cane harvesting season, the cane 
<br/>trucks  are  still  using  their  old  alignment  to  the  road,  but  eventually  we  want  to  move  it  to  the  new 
<br/>alignment. The reinstated slip has not shown any sign of distress thus suggests the immediate need for 
<br/>realignment works to be prioritised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the bridge at the Lomaloma, this is in the middle.  At the moment what FRA is doing is in 
<br/>the planning and design stage for the long slip, I think this will be about 100 metres (long bridge) that has 
<br/>to be run right across the area where the Lomaloma slip has been taking place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third observation that was done and the Report was about the auditor issuing a qualified audit 
<br/>opinion on 2017-2018 accounts of FRA for a number of different reasons.  There is a question on whether 
<br/>the agreement between the FRA and the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and the city and 
<br/>town council are still in operation.  The Agreement with the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>for the rural roads project is still operational but employing the Ministry’s staff in the maritime islands 
<br/>has been and these staff have now been absorbed in FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the agreement with the municipal councils FRA is in the process of putting together a new 
<br/>agreement with municipal councils and we hope to have this in our operation later on in this financial 
<br/>year.  Currently FRA looks after the roads and the municipal councils are looking after the beautification 
<br/>of the areas around the roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third item that was emphasised here was another issue that was raised by the auditor in terms 
<br/>of the contracts that were used that led to the removal of the funding by the ADB.  What FRA is doing 
<br/>now is that since 2019 all contracts are being executed using the finick general conditions of contract. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2339 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This includes the critical bridge replacements, the Suva Arterial Road Upgrade Project </span><span>2</span><span> (</span><span>SARUP 2</span><span>), 
<br/>Foster Road Upgrade, Queens Road Upgrade, Kings Road Upgrade and all the rip and remaking that is 
<br/>taking place across Fiji.  We are now incorporating and using the finick ways of standards of contract to 
<br/>make sure that we do not have a repeat of the issues that happened that led to the termination of that 
<br/>funding from ADB some years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a number of recommendations in the Report from Page No. 9 onwards.  I would like to 
<br/>confirm these are good recommendations and FRA is confirming on all the recommendations that have 
<br/>been considerable uptake and implementation of the following recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To collaborate and work together with other agencies FRA is doing that. 
<br/>FRA is mainly assisting lot of these agencies with technical expertise and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>A lot of stakeholders want FRA to take over their roles as we know in Fiji we have 
<br/>around 12,000 kilometres of road. Only less than 7,000 belongs to FRA. We have 
<br/>agricultural roads, access roads, forestry roads - all of these other kinds of roads. 
<br/>Some are private roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More and more people want FRA to take out these roads and where it is possible FRA does this 
<br/></span><span>in accordance with the amount of the budget that it has but the maintenance of other stakeholder assets is 
<br/></span><span>not possible at the moment as FRA is working on improving the level of service to the current FRA assets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the first things that we have seen over the past one and a half years FRA is looking at 
<br/>consolidating its existing roles.  That is why a lot of rip and remaking is taking place and that is one of 
<br/>the rehabilitation has been taking place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation was to ensure comprehensive coastal and flood protection plan is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>formulated, budgeted for and implemented. So course on protective works have been taking place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  now  go  to  Ovalau  you  will  see  the  extensive  coastal  protection  work  that  has  been 
<br/>undertaken there. It has been taking place in Savusavu, Taveuni, somewhere along the Queens Road.  
<br/>This will continue over time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in Ovalau itself has cost almost $8 million for the coastal protection.  As you know in 
<br/>Ovalau the honourable Vosanibola will know the road runs right next to the ocean, the ocean is rising so 
<br/>that has been that need to be able to do that investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  third  one  is  to  continue  to  develop,  maintain  alternative  and  resilient  routes  which  are 
<br/></span><span>accessible after disasters.  Pre-feasibilities study have already started for this, Sir, however construction 
<br/>will start after three to five years and also will depend on budgetary allocation. As you know we have 
<br/>been through some of the most difficult years economically in this country. So money has to be prioritised 
<br/>and not all of the projects that we want to implement can be implemented immediately.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Continue to maintain roadside drainage so as to reduce flooding and subsequent damage to roads. 
<br/>These works are ongoing. They have been programmed to be done on an annual basis.  Most of the 
<br/>programmes now to be continued as budgetary constraints are met. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Create permanent solutions for crossing which are continuously damaged during cyclones and 
<br/>floods.  There is also work that has been allocated for this in accordance with the Budgetary allocation 
<br/>that has been approved the work continues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Expedite the planning and design of low level crossing, resilient programmes had commenced 
<br/>with physical works at affected areas. These works were also allowed for in the 2022/2023 financial year 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and work has been undertaken in accordance with the amount of money that has been made available in 
<br/>the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consider taking over a non-FRA roads which are accessible to public transport so as to enable 
<br/>the timely maintenance and upkeep. This is something that FRA has been doing in the past even if it is 
<br/>not a FRA asset. If it is not a FRA road, if public transport is using that where possible FRA tries to fix 
<br/>the roads up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last few Budgets you will notice in the 2021/2022 the current budget, review budget, mini 
<br/>budget there was a figure of $5 million that was made available for the repair of non-FRA assets.  That 
<br/>is also something that is being undertaken right now.  In consultation with relevant agencies, renewal of 
<br/>roads in rural and urban areas to cater for increasing road usage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FRA is currently focused on improving the level of serviceability on the current infrastructure.  
<br/>Once this is completed then FRA will start work on this.  It is fixing up the current roads and then look 
<br/>at widening them later - fix them up, conserve them and make sure that they are functioning well and 
<br/>then look at the widening later on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ninth recommendation was to develop or maintain hinterland roads to ease traffic congestion 
<br/></span><span>on Fiji’s main roads.  Pre-feasibility studies have already started.  This will need to be to finalised into 
<br/>the future and you would have heard during the honourable Attorney-General’s Address for the Budget 
<br/>that there is a major plan to drive a road across the middle of Viti Levu to open up those areas and provide 
<br/>alternative routes to reach the western side of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 10 was to continue repairing and maintaining jetties, passenger shelters and 
<br/>public  amenities.    When  I  was  talking  earlier  this  week  answering  a  question  about  jetties,  I  had 
<br/>mentioned the amount of money that is being made available for jetties.  Earlier this week they had talked 
<br/>about  the  $12.2  million  being  available  for  jetties:  Nabouwalu  Jetty,  Savusavu  Jetty,  Vunisea  Jetty, 
<br/>Waiyevo Jetty, Natovi Jetty - the waiting shed, Makogai Jetty, Nabukeru Jetty, Moala Jetty and also 
<br/>Lomaloma Jetty.  There has been monies set aside for the jetties because we believe as the honourable 
<br/>Adimaitoga has said, the roads need to function well not only in the urban areas but also in the rural 
<br/>maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 11</span><span>th</span><span> Recommendation was to fast track its work on creating by-pass roads and bridges to ease 
<br/>traffic congestion in towns and cities. Once again, a lot of these areas pre-feasibility work have started, 
<br/>however extra construction will start once the Budget comes in line. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I appreciate the Committee for its work in providing these 
<br/>recommendations and I can assure the Parliament that as Minister responsible for FRA we take these 
<br/>recommendations very seriously and we follow them up to them to make sure that they implement them 
<br/>so that we can have the best possible roads and jetties and bridges for the people of our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, being a Member of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social  Affairs  I  rise  to  make  some  contributions  on  the  motion  moved  by  honourable  Viam  Pillay; 
<br/>Chairperson of the Social Affairs Committee and I note that the honourable Minister has spoken at length 
<br/>so I will be brief with my presentation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For FRA the focus for the 2017-2018 was the restructure to bring about processes and procedures 
<br/>to enable it to make decisions that are based on good governance.  During 2017-2018, FRA was able to 
<br/>carry out maintenance work to the value of $121 million on the roads and structure and a further $38 
<br/>million was spent on emergency services.  The new capital works focus on the delivery of much needed 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new assets in support of public safety and accessibility with the major push on providing safe pedestrian 
<br/>access and street lighting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017–2018, we saw the completion of FRA’s first solar street lighting network.  The total new 
<br/>capital spent that year was $275 million.  The years 2017–2018 also marked a major expenditure in the 
<br/>new capital access centre which consists of rural roads around the country with spending of $38 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the programme to improve access throughout the country, FRA has assessed renewal 
<br/>projects which recorded a spending of $143 million of roads, bridges and jetty renewals.  The Authority 
<br/>also made a major investment in road safety for communities which included new footpaths, improving 
<br/>access for people with disabilities, construction of new bus shelters and waiting facilities at jetties.  FRA 
<br/>spent $18 million in this sector in 2017–20178 Financial Year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  FRA  utilised  98  percent  of  its  budget  expenditure  in  the  2017–2018  financial  year  as 
<br/>compared to 97 percent of budgeted expenditure in 2016 and 2017, $435 million plus was allocated for 
<br/>maintenance and renewal of footbridges footpaths programmes and for capital projects in 2017 and 2018 
<br/>comparative to $300 million plus in 2016 and 2017.  Additionally, approximately, $40 million worth of 
<br/>works was done for roads in municipal council areas in 2017 and 2018 compared to approximately $37 
<br/></span><span>million expended in 2016-2017 Financial Year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, another significant achievement for FRA was the opening of the new Vatuwaqa and Stinson 
<br/>Bridges.   FRA employed a total of 182 employees in 2017-2018, an increase from 148 staff employed 
<br/>in 2016-2017. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work done by FRA is commendable and I support the motion that is 
<br/>before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Viam Pillay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a reliable transport infrastructure is an essential ingredient for development as 
<br/>it encourages people and business to invest.  Better road infrastructure facilitates the movement of people 
<br/>and goods between business and local as well as international markets.  The road network is one of the 
<br/>most valuable assets that the country processes with the value of around $12 billion.  In the 2016-2017 
<br/>Financial Year around 6,589 kilometres of roads, 1,399 bridges and 33 jetties were managed by the FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise that investment in road infrastructure is essential for future growth hence over the 
<br/>years our road infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been modernised to cater for the increase in urban 
<br/></span><span>population, growth in our economy and industries and all of these have been done with an eye towards 
<br/></span><span>our long term development.  To serve our future development needs the FRA has ensured that it delivers 
<br/>on two key objectives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>To improve the safety and reliability of the existing network; and 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>To expand the network to provide the capacity for sustained growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sustained investment in our road bridges and jetties provide Fijians with access 
<br/>to services, facilities and markets.  The FRA has continued to ensure that streetlights are installed in all 
<br/>major urban centres and peri-urban areas and in front of villages and settlements along the Queens and 
<br/>Kings  Roads.    This  is  an  ongoing  project,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  will  encourage  road  safety  and  the 
<br/>establishments of road side stalls along our highways for rural dwellers to undertake income generating 
<br/>activities to support their livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FRA has continued to construct new footpaths across populated areas and major cities and 
<br/>towns, make roads safer for pedestrians and drivers.  Traffic lights have been installed at critical junctions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for there is a high traffic flow to manage traffic conjunctions and improve safety. In line with our national 
<br/>and global commitments of climate change we support the importation and use of fuel, efficient hybrid 
<br/>and electrical vehicles to reduce fuel importation and protect the environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2022-2023 National Budget my Government has increased subsidy for 
<br/>capital  investments  in  electric  charging  infrastructure  from  5  percent  to  10  percent  overall  lower 
<br/>investment threshold of $50,000.  Further VAT and fiscal duty on all electrical vehicles will now be zero 
<br/>rated and Government will provide a $5,000 subsidy per if a local business purchases five vehicles or 
<br/>more.  This will encourage the use of electrical vehicles and reduce both our high import bills as well as 
<br/>pollution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA has successfully carried out Government’s mandate of ensuring better 
<br/>road infrastructure and making sure that no one is left behind through the development of jetties and 
<br/>bridges, crossings, footpaths, street lights, traffic lights in urban and peri-urban, rural and maritime areas.  
<br/>Fijians outside urban areas are now connected more than ever and are able to access various Government 
<br/>services such as Health Centres, schools, and provincial offices as the result of infrastructure development 
<br/>over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Government has ensured that the age-old problem of our rural and maritime dwellers being 
<br/></span><span>left to fend for themselves, is now a thing of the past.  We have taken development to the doorsteps of 
<br/>those  living  outside  and  urban  centres,  and  we  have  made  sure  that  they  are  provided  the  same 
<br/>opportunities for growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That work, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is never ending because our urban areas improved as well as our 
<br/>rural communities.  That is the commitment we are delivering and that we will never fail to meet.  I thank 
<br/>the Standing Committee for scrutinising the Report and based on those remarks, I support the motion 
<br/>before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  The funding for FRA over 
<br/>the past number of years does not only come through the normal budgetary process but also through what 
<br/>we call the Transport Infrastructure Investment Sector Project financed with the ADB and the World 
<br/>Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Opposition actually talks about loans they should know that we take out loans to build 
<br/>many of these roads.  A lot of them come to mind that has not been invested for quite some time, of 
<br/>course: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sawani, Serea Road is tarsealed 
<br/>Sigatoka Valley Road has been tarsealed 
<br/>Nabouwalu to Dreketi Road has been tarsealed 
<br/>On the other side the Hibiscus Highway that has been tarsealed and of course 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Moto Bridge and  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Moto Roads that have been tarsealed too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are of significant financial outlays and that is why we borrow money to actually build capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted very much in detail by the honourable Minister for Infrastructure a lot of bridges 
<br/>are covered under these bridges that we have got that are funded through loans.  I think the point I would 
<br/>like to make very briefly, I think the Opposition tend to forget that when we say FRA it is not only about 
<br/>roads, it is about bridges, jetties, drainage, footpaths and streetlights too.  These are holistic approaches 
<br/></span><span>to the maintenance of infrastructure to do with the transportation sector.   Honourable Gavoka would 
<br/></span><span>know as he travels a lot to Nadroga, that from Namada at the moment, you will see Namada all the way 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2343 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up to now the Outrigger there is a massive rebuild of the roads.  A significant point is that for those of 
<br/>you including the honourable Saukuru when you travel back to Lautoka you notice that there is not just 
<br/>the resealing of the roads there is a lot of drainage works that is taking place.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at Namada Village there are so many drains that are actually coming out from the 
<br/>village side on to the foreshore side.  Similarly with Malevu and Vatukarasa you will see all the curb and 
<br/>channels being put in - a massive amount of drainage work.  All of these roads, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you 
<br/>know a biggest enemy of stable road system is water and proper drainage is required for water.  It depends 
<br/>on the soil type of many of these areas.  You can go to the Western side where all the soil types are very 
<br/>different, it is hardened, more rocky, a lot more durable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You can come to the Sawani side, you can go to the Rewa side, very soft clay material that is why 
<br/>there is a lot of pottery coming out from these areas because the soil texture is very different.  When you 
<br/>have heavy trucks, for example, on clay ridden roads being driven upon as opposed to the hardened rock 
<br/>roads then obviously the damage or the limitation of damage is different.   The roads for example, from 
<br/>Namada to the Outrigger a lot of drainage work has been put in.  If we do not do that we can come and 
<br/>do a nice surface road, within a few months, depending on the climatic conditions, it can deteriorate quite 
<br/>significantly because there is no proper drainage, the core base has not been done properly, so it does cost 
<br/></span><span>a lot more money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that we wish to also make is that, I think one of the Members 
<br/>had mentioned about the streetlight on the back road to Nausori.  It is actually being done.  Not necessarily 
<br/>in Sawani and Serea at this point in time, but a lot of the built-up areas.  So if you drive past the turn after 
<br/>ACS and you keep on going towards Waila, there is a huge built-up of population there. A lot of people 
<br/>walk on the roads and the honourable Member has acknowledged the huge waterway works that is being 
<br/>carried out.  Already about 17 kilometres of the 23 kilometres of water pipes have already been laid.  So 
<br/>there is a lot of work being carried out.  There is no point actually doing the roads now, if we are going 
<br/>to still dig it up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka is absolutely right about people digging up roads.  If you look at the street 
<br/>that I live in at Vunakece, yesterday, I saw some people digging across the road because someone has 
<br/>built a block of apartments and Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has to connect the pipes from that side of 
<br/>the road to the other side.  So those guys were digging the road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, WAF, FRA and EFL are also in a lot of discussions about having what we call 
<br/>an “inter-agency agreement”.  When can they dig up, who will do the rebuild and who will pay for it?  
<br/></span><span>These are significant issues and many countries actually have to deal with it and  I know Australia had 
<br/></span><span>significant issues with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We treat a lot of the roading networks as pathways for laying in other infrastructure, whether it is 
<br/>Telecom, EFL or WAF, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   There is now a system that is going to be put in place andat 
<br/>one point in time, we had wanted to actually regulate it by way of law.  But we believe that they can, in 
<br/>fact, reach an agreement amongst themselves, and that is a significant issue which is being resolved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to also highlight is that, a number of the Members of 
<br/>Opposition have, time and time again, alluded to the fact that the roads are in a much worst state today 
<br/>than they were before.   Completely untrue, Sir.  They have not presented any facts or figures regarding 
<br/>that.  In fact, many people would argue that the road conditions in Fiji are far, far more better now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I also wish to highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what honourable Adimaitoga 
<br/>mentioned about connectivity in rural areas and honourable Usamate had also mentioned that.  There is 
<br/>a lot of work being done in Vanua Levu and we hope the honourable Prime Minister will be there soon

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to commission a lot of the road works that are being cut, where people are now being connected far more 
<br/>easily to markets and to the urban centres.  If you look at Vanua Levu, there are many sections where a 
<br/>lot of the crossings have eroded and many of the shortcuts that could be taken where it reduces  travelling 
<br/>time from two hours now to only 20 minutes or half-an-hour is being done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  have  highlighted  during the  Budget  Address,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we  had  wished that if 
<br/>previous Governments had even cut 50 kilometres of new roads a year, today, most of Fiji would be 
<br/>connected.  We have people on the eastern side of Vanua Levu, on the Tawake side going up to Udu 
<br/>Point, completely disconnected.  So, by connecting them to roads or doing those shortcuts, we are actually 
<br/>reducing their cost of living.  We are actually increasing their productivity capacity by ensuring that they 
<br/>do not have to spend $500 to go and sell fish that is worth $700.  So, those are some of the things that 
<br/>have been carried out by FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the legal matter that honourable Radrodro raised, obviously we cannot talk about it - </span><span>sub 
<br/>judice</span><span>, it is on appeal.  Let us not make a big deal out of legal matters.  This is part and parcel of any 
<br/>contract.  Contracts sometimes go wrong.  We can mediate, we can arbitrate, of course, we do not want 
<br/>litigation.  That is always the last recourse.  But if there is, then we have to deal with it accordingly.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I would like to also take this opportunity to thank the CEO of FRA.  He is a Fijian CEO, he 
<br/></span><span>has come through the ranks and, in fact, he is delivering fantastically and is very, very responsive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point that I wish to make is that, as also announced in the Budget, the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy together with Ministry of Infrastructure, FRA and Town and Country Planning are 
<br/>also looking at the different standards that could be adopted in subdivisions that are carried out in deep 
<br/>rural  areas.    So  rather  than  applying  the  standards  that  we  require,  for  example,  in  subdivision 
<br/>municipalities in  deep rural areas, if iTLTB or some other individual investor is carrying out subdivision 
<br/>of agricultural land, we do not actually have to get them to build the two-metre footpaths out in the bush.  
<br/>We can have allocations for that because the time when it gets all under a municipal area, then we can do 
<br/>that.  But in the meantime, there is no requirement so it reduces the cost of development, reduces the cost 
<br/>of subdivision, so these subdivisions can go ahead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen a new appetite by many city and town dwellers who want to have what we call 
<br/>“hobby farms”.  They do like to go out for the weekend and plant their </span><span>dalo</span><span>, do their cassava or have 
<br/>someone live on their farm whilst they work in the city, and a lot of people are doing that now.  So those 
<br/>subdivisions with 99-year leases, et cetera, we can encourage that and FRA has now come on board to 
<br/>ensure that, that does happen.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.     
<br/></span></div>
