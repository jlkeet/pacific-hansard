<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF FORESTRY  
<br/>2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report of the consolidated 2016-2017, 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 2018–2019 Ministry of Forestry Annual Reports which was tabled on 11th May, 2022.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament,  I, as the Chairperson of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Natural Resources  who moved the motion, take this opportunity to speak on 
<br/>the motion in regards to the Natural Resources Committee Review Report on the Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>2016–2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 Annual Reports.  These  are consolidated Review Reports that 
<br/>contained the findings of the Committee on the administration, organisational structure, programmes, 
<br/></span><span>major achievements and performance of the Ministry of Forestry during the review period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight the responsibility of the Ministry of Forestry and that it is 
<br/>responsible for the formulation of policies, to ensure the long term sustainability of Fiji’s forest resources, 
<br/>stimulate economic growth within the forestry sector and improve livelihood of the communities that rely 
<br/>on these resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  achieved  these  by  ensuring  balance  between  resource  utilisation  and  resource 
<br/>conservation, and the development and alignment of its policies, strategies and structures, in order to 
<br/>better address emerging issues, capture emerging opportunities and ensure effective and efficient services 
<br/>delivery to all stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  noted  that  the  Ministry  of  Forestry’s  export  has  increased 
<br/>steadily from the years 2016 to 2019 (the reports under review), despite Fiji’s facing a major disaster - 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, in the  year 2016.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry also focussed on housing rehabilitation in the maritime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>zone in the island of Cicia, Gau and Kadavu, that were severely affected by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the organisational structure of the Ministry of Forestry is being realigned to 
<br/>drive economic growth in the forestry sector for the short and mid-term, and strategies for the mid to 
<br/>longer term to capture emerging opportunities, such as wood energy and carbon grading in the forestry 
<br/>sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  commended  the  Ministry’s  effort  in  recognising  women’s 
<br/>participation  in  areas  of  its  operations  in  line  with  SDG  5  on  Gender  Equality,  as  well  as  ensuring 
<br/>implementing other relevant activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, the Committee noted the consistency of performance of the Ministry of 
<br/>Forestry for the years under review.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, from its findings, the Committee has put forward 
<br/>some recommendations to the Ministry for its improvements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I commend the effort of the Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
<br/>in the compilation of the Report and to the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Forestry for their timely

<div><span> Review Report-Ministry of Forestry 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I commend the effort of the Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
<br/>in the compilation of the Report and to the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Forestry for their timely 
<br/>contribution towards the compilation of this bipartisan Committee Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few comments, as a Member moving the motion of the Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee on Natural Resources Report, I thank you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will be brief. I support the motion, together with 
<br/>the  recommendation  of  the  Committee  on  the  timely  submission  of  Annual  Reports.  I  thank  the 
<br/>Committee for dealing with the 2015-2018 Annual Reports and Planted Forest Policy, you need to plant 
<br/>more trees.  I am just wondering whether the FijiFirst Government has established any forest plantation 
<br/>- the sandalwood plantation, teak plantation, argo wood plantation or any other plantation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s pine and mahogany was established by previous Governments.  The  annual sawmilling 
<br/>licences has been rectified by the Government and thank you for that. The improvement of the process 
<br/>of issuance of licence in a month has already been rectified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry encouraged landowners’ participation in the logging and sawmilling operations and 
<br/>I will be elaborating more on that.  Also, the Ministry should ensure that the Forest Bill is reintroduced 
<br/>to Parliament for enactment.  It is important to follow-up those recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  forestry  and  logging,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  2.27  percent  to  a  dismal  0.57  percent  GDP 
<br/>contribution, now reducing to 0.26 percent for 2020, only a small increase in the 2022 Budget, what a 
<br/>shame!  Why such a lucrative commodity can only contribute such a meagre contribution?  Whatever it 
<br/>takes, Sir, to revolutionise production and export in various products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Fiji pine, Sir, I cannot say much there but only to congratulate Fiji Pine Limited for what it 
<br/>has achieved, for performing well, even during COVID-19, with the increase in pine chips export to Japan 
<br/>and China.  However, the export of sawn timber is still over 50 percent for the other exports.  The total 
<br/>exports, minus the chips export value and  sawn timber, the balance is still over 50 percent for those 
<br/>exports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need value adding increase in export, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is why I had proposed a motion, 
<br/>I think $950,000 then it went on to $50,000 in the  2022-2023 Budget for value adding machines.  Sir, 
<br/></span><span>$50,000  is  not  enough  to  revolutionise  value  adding  products  to  increase  our  exports.    We    need  to 
<br/></span><span>increase assistance to pine, native and mahogany timber landowners and businesses to increase exports 
<br/>and revenue, and contribution to GDP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On lease rental distribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether $6 million is going to be distributed, fine.  
<br/>That is their entitlement under the lease condition.  Rentals have been increased from peppercorn rent to 
<br/>market rent and the percentage of UCV has been increased over the years.  Now, I hear that dividend of 
<br/>over nine years is going to be paid - $36.5 million, and I am thankful for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, they have realised that they should be paying the rightful dividend to the landowners.  I 
<br/>have mentioned that in this House several times and now I am thankful that they have realised that they 
<br/>should be paying the rightful dividend to the pine landowners. What about the dividend for the other five 
<br/>years? Where is it? That $36.5 million is still not enough.  It should be around or over $100 million, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  They are still robbing the pine landowners, since and still continue to rob them now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ensure ownership of the pine industry by pine landowners by 2025 and review the capital 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2347 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>structure with continuing partnership of landowners and the Government with full business best practice, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on native and mahogany, it is for natural resource areas to increase production 
<br/>for export and foreign exchange revenue for Fiji.  To some detail, I used the mahogany industry as an 
<br/>example, however, this industry continues to fall.  The sleeping giant, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the  coming into effect of the Mahogany Act (Mahogany Decree in 2011) to reform the 
<br/>industry,  our production  export  keeps  deepening,  Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have here in  Fiji the largest, 
<br/>mature and best quality mahogany plantation in the world, yet we continue to fail.  We still fail to get the 
<br/>maximum benefits from such readily available resource and markets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previous  Governments  have  established  them  and  yet,  the  FijiFirst  Government  still  fails  to 
<br/>unravel it and properly share out the benefits to the pine and mahogany landowners.  Instead, it is just 
<br/>robbing and squeezing them from their rightful economic benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the yield dropped from $150,000 as estimated by Fiji Hardwood Corporation 
<br/>Limited (FHCL) or 112,000 cubic metres a year to 80,000 cubic metres a year.  For licences, I think it is 
<br/></span><span>on an open market which is good and we are thankful for that but sometimes, there is late payment of 
<br/></span><span>rental and stumpage, as well as timber sales proceeds are yet to be paid, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will elaborate 
<br/>on that later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on log production, FHCL was never profitable, ending up in incurring  losses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>close to $30 million and with Government guarantee, debt to FHL has now been paid, I believe.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  actual  production  dropped  substantially  from  $96,000  or  90,000  cubic 
<br/>metres to 15,000 cubic metres.  I think it has increased lately, I do not have the figures now.  But the usual 
<br/>reasons given for the reduction in production figures are unfavourable weather, harvesting capability, 
<br/>economic factors, log sales, log price, log market, et cetera.   This had been known since 2006 about the 
<br/>weather.  Yet, failing to resolve and improve an effective management structure for increased production.  
<br/>What has the Mahogany Industry Council (MIC) and FHCL doing or rather failing to do?  They cannot 
<br/>profitably managed it.  The MIC only meets once every two or three years and FHCL continues to change 
<br/>its Chairman, Board Members and CEO many times since 2006. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, MIC and FHCL for over 60 years cannot return a fair share of the mahogany 
<br/>industry to be a profitable entity.  Why?  Meanwhile, Fiji suffers - no annual reports, export performance 
<br/></span><span>dropped again substantially.  The figures shows a very discouraging trend from 24,000 cubic metres to 
<br/></span><span>only 3,000 cubic metres in 2018 and 10,000 in 2019.  I do not know about the latest figure.  If they have 
<br/>increased, fine, but if not, it is always deepening and deepening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mahogany export revenue dropped as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from $30 million in 2011 to 
<br/>only $10 million in 2019.  So, it is important to increase that, Sir. What can be done to improve export 
<br/>and foreign revenue?  There is capacity and opportunities,  yet the FijiFirst Government plays a very 
<br/>uninterested attention to it.  Again, is it because of the likely benefits to the iTaukei resource owners?  
<br/>That  is the question.    Another  ‘Sayed-Khaiyum; sunset clause  strategy.   Why  is there no immediate 
<br/>attention  to  improvements  to  wood  supply  production  pricing,  milling,  processing,  value  adding  and 
<br/>export?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other questions that need to be answered are many, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are many questions 
<br/>asked and there are no answers.  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the FijiFirst Government, the MIC and FHCL 
<br/>do not know what to do here, they need help and only this Parliament can help.  So, only by instituting a 
<br/>petition through a Parliament select committee to inquire into the industry and to report back to us with 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report-Ministry of Forestry 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answers, but we do not have that opportunity now.  We will give it to you next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a need to reform and restructure the  Mahogany Industry with the purpose of maximising 
<br/>benefits to the resource owners and foreign earnings to Fiji and increase contribution to GDP to reduce 
<br/>import and export deficit and reduce debt, and more money for Fiji.  Whatever it takes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we need to revolutionise the Mahogany Industry and the other economic sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on timber sales proceeds, under the Mahogany Act, they need to pay timber 
<br/>sales proceeds. No single cent had been paid so far.  Under the Act, the Mahogany Industry Council was 
<br/>supposed to establish a formula to pay this out.  Why is it taking so long?  Why has the Mahogany Industry 
<br/>Council not made a formula since 2011, it is over 10 years now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act does not say that to first pay debt, then pay timber sales proceeds, as claimed by the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Economy.  That is a lie.  He mentioned here the last time that they did not pay the 
<br/>timber  sales  proceeds  because  the  Act  says  that  you  must  pay  the  debt  first.    No,  the  Act  says  that 
<br/>Mahogany Industry Council is to formulate a formula to pay out the timber sale proceeds. In other words, 
<br/>they should come up with the formula, how much to pay for the debts, how much to go for mahogany 
<br/>forestry development, how much to go for branding and how much to go to the landowners as timber 
<br/></span><span>sales proceeds? They are simple but over 10 years, there is still no formula has been established, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since,  2011,  there  was  no  formula.    Why?  Another  sunset  clause  strategy  to  rob  mahogany 
<br/>landowners, deprive and suppress them from their economic benefits.  Shame! That is the reality, that is 
<br/>the fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just as for Pine, we are going to draw out  a formula to ensure payment of timber sales proceeds 
<br/>is made as soon as possible and review a workable beneficial capital structure for landowners as owners 
<br/>of the mahogany business and the Government for the future that both win and/or share proceeds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to give them what they are supposed to get. There are markets 
<br/>there already there, Sir, I am talking on Recommendation No. 5 that the Ministry encourages landowners’ 
<br/>participation  in  the  logging  and  sawmilling  operations.    I  am  just  enlightening  on  that,  so  read  your 
<br/>recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am trying to encourage the Government to do what it is 
<br/>supposed to do and give the benefits to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners. Thank you very much and I support the 
<br/></span><span>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my statement on the Ministry 
<br/>of Forestry’s Annual Report for 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019.  But before I do so, I just want 
<br/>to say that honourable Bulanauca always amazes me.  Imagine this honourable parliamentarian was a 
<br/>Minister at one stage, God help us if he becomes a Minister again.  He does not seem to know what he is 
<br/>talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  year 2016-2017 saw the Department of Forestry transition into a single 
<br/>portfolio Ministry with my Government’s decision to separate the Departments of Fisheries and Forests.  
<br/>The logic behind the separation was to enable both Ministries to effectively channel more resources and 
<br/>efforts towards the development of the two sectors, thereby facilitating greater economic returns while 
<br/>prioritising sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Forestry was allocated $11.4 million in the 2016-2017 National Budget. Some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the major achievements for the year included the:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  helped  repurpose  fallen  tress  into  housing  timber  for  the  affected 
<br/>communities.  
<br/>The  Ministry  continues  the  reforestation  of  degraded  lands  around  the  country  and 
<br/>continued raising awareness on the importance of trees and forests.   
<br/>The Ministry dedicated Colo-i- Suva Forest Park as part of the Queen’s Commonwealth 
<br/>Canopy,  which  is  a  network  of  forest  conservation  programmes  in  the  Commonwealth 
<br/>member countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2017-2018 financial year, the Ministry was allocated a budget of $16 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million.  Some of the year’s major achievement included: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishing the first indigenous tree species nursery at the Vunimaqo Forestry Station in 
<br/>Galoa. 
<br/>Establishing the Forest Wardens Programme. 
<br/>Continuing reforesting efforts of degraded land across the country. 
<br/>The Ministry officially opened the Nabalasere Eco-Tourism Forest Park in the Province of 
<br/>Ra. 
<br/>The Ministry also signed and implemented the Memorandum of Understanding with the 
<br/></span><span>Government of Indonesia on 24</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2018, at the 3rd Asia Pacific Rainforest Summit in 
<br/></span><span>Indonesia.  
<br/>The Ministry  received  US$2million in  additional funding from the World  Bank  for the 
<br/>REDD+  Programme,  including  the  preparation  of  the  REDD+  Conservation  Lease 
<br/>Agreement for the National REDD+ Pilot Site in the Emalu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the financial year 2018-2019, the Ministry received a total budget of $17.07 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million.  Some of the major achievements for the year included the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Endorsement without condition by the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility of 
<br/>Fiji’s Forest Emission and Reduction Programme document and the Readiness Package. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hosting of the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, at the Colo-i-Suva Forest Park. 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The launching of Fiji’s initial National Tree Planting Campaign of 4 Million Trees in four 
<br/>years by the then President of Fiji, His Excellency Major-General (Retired) Jioji Konrote. 
<br/>The finalisation of the Ministry’s 13-Year Strategic Development Plan, which is aligned to 
<br/>the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals and Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year National 
<br/>Development Plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  same  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  signed  an  MOU  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, to ensure compliance of forest-based companies with 
<br/>Fiji’s employment laws, and a separate MOU with the FNPF, to ensure that all forest-based companies 
<br/>contribute to the mandatory funds for their respective employees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very brief overview of the performance and significant achievements 
<br/>of the Ministry of Forestry from 2016 to 2019.  This period laid the strong foundation upon which Fiji’s 
<br/>Forestry Sector continues to grow new heights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, the Forestry Sector achieved the record-breaking export revenue of over $118.5 million, 
<br/>something he does not know.  Alongside this, Fiji also planted 15 million trees and mangroves in less 
<br/>than four years since 2019.  We are already achieving what we set out to do through the separation of the 
<br/>Forestry and Fisheries Departments, record economic development and concrete sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the leadership and the staff of the Ministry, together with all the stakeholders in the 
<br/>Forestry Sector.  I also take this opportunity to commend the work of the then Minister for Forestry, the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>late honourable Osea Naiqamu, who was called to eternal rest in January this year.  He has left behind a 
<br/>great legacy in spearheading Fiji’s national tree planting efforts across all the Provinces in Fiji, including 
<br/>the maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a resource-based sector often challenged by conflicting demands, the annual budget allocation 
<br/>empowers  the  Ministry  to  develop  initiatives  that  address  these  challenges  and  deliver  effective  and 
<br/>improved  services,  all  while  positively  contributing  to  Fiji’s  economic  and  social  development  and 
<br/>ensuring environmental integrity and climate change mitigation in the process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just would like to add on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the returns to the mahogany landowners will 
<br/>gradually increase, just like Fiji Pine.  We had just paid out over $36 million in lease security bonus 
<br/>payment to the landowners under my Government.  Only under my Government did landowners begin 
<br/>to reap the rewards from leasing their lands for pine plantation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He does not know that.  Honourable Bulanauca can only talk, all full of hot air.  During his time, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with pine and mahogany, he did absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mahogany production is gradually increasing up to 40,000 cubic metres.  The sustainable harvest 
<br/></span><span>volume per annum is 80,000 cubic metres.  The Forestry Sector achieved Fiji’s highest export earnings, 
<br/></span><span>as I have said, ever in 2021 worth $118.5 million.  This record exports can be maintained when mahogany 
<br/>production reaches its sustainable harvest volume per year.  With those comments, Mr. Speaker, I support 
<br/>the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  Honourable Bulanauca 
<br/>talked  a  lot  about  the  mahogany  industry  and  obviously  misled  Parliament  again.    The  Report,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is about the Ministry of Forestry and the work that has been carried out in that period, and 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister has highlighted that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  point  that  I  wish  to  make  in  respect  of  the  mahogany  industry  is  that, 
<br/>honourable Bulanauca did not tell Parliament that Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL) had a debt 
<br/>stock of about $25 million in 2007. Even though it held all the leases pertaining to mahogany plantations, 
<br/>it had not made a single cent of profit until then.  Since its creation it had not made a single cent of profit 
<br/>and now, he is saying it is justified.  He does not tell Parliament that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the debt stock now with FHCL is only a couple of million dollars left.  In 
<br/>fact, it should be cleared up by the end of this year.  He is absolutely incorrect also to say that we should 
<br/></span><span>be paying out when he knows exactly that in the Tree Planting Programme for mahogany plantations, the 
<br/></span><span>landowners are being involved with that, and landowners are getting paid for that also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Linked to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to highlight, as announced in Parliament some 
<br/>months back, Government has secured loan funding from the World Bank under the Jobs for Nature 
<br/>Programme.  Sir, under this Programme, we will be paying minimum wages which is $4 an hour from 
<br/>January of next year to any youth group or women’s group that wants to go out and plant.  That does not 
<br/>only include, for example, hardwood or indigenous species or pine, it will also include things like fruit 
<br/>trees, whether it be breadfruit and other fruits, it also includes that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have reached out.  We are working with all the different Ministries – Ministry of Forestry, 
<br/>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and all the different relevant agencies where any of 
<br/>these  groups  can  come  and  register  with  us,  we  purchase  the  seedlings  for  them,  we  give  them  the 
<br/>seedlings and they actually go out and plant.  This not only creates jobs, Sir, but it also helps us achieve 
<br/>and meet our target for planting 30 million trees.  Also, Sir, this is part and parcel of what we are doing

<div><span> Review Report-Ministry of Forestry 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2351 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in terms of empowering, not only resource owners, but also those who are involved and interested in the 
<br/>forestry industry, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point we wish to also make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the philosophical approach to forestry 
<br/>and the way that the Forestry Sector has always been assessed in terms of its output.  We have always 
<br/>had this approach that forests are only registered in our GDP, once it is actually harvested.  Trees alone 
<br/>are not given the same value when it is in the ground or when the roots are in the ground, but only when 
<br/>we cut it down and  mill it, only then it achieves the value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  Climate  Change  Act,  Sir,  we  now  have  carbon  trading.    Honourable  Saukuru,  I 
<br/>remember his very passionate statement when we had the Climate Change Act where he said, “Now you 
<br/>are  going  to  charge  us  for  breathing  oxygen  when  oxygen  belongs  to  God.”    This  is  the  level  of 
<br/>contribution from honourable Saukuru, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Carbon trading is all about saying that how much carbon will a particular forest take in or sink it 
<br/>in and in turn obviously, puts out oxygen.  So there is a value attached to that, and that is what you call 
<br/>the carbon trading, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Prime Minister highlighted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a World Bank project 
<br/></span><span>where we have identified a particular forest.  Currently, the Ministry has been allocated funding to be 
<br/>able to carry out an accounting of Fiji’s forest resources and essentially, to help us get into carbon trading 
<br/>quite significantly.  And that is a very huge philosophical shift in terms of how we view our forests, and 
<br/>that  is  critically  important  because  those  forest  reserves  will  not  only  generate  money  for  those 
<br/>landowners on which the forests are planted or naturally has been there, but it also means that they can 
<br/>use those forests for other income-generating purposes without actually having to cut the trees down, and 
<br/>that is what we need to understand.  So, when you talk about exports, honourable Bulanauca, it is not 
<br/>about cutting the trees down, it is about the revenue you generate from it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  urge  honourable  Bulanauca  to  stop  coming  to  Parliament  and 
<br/>misleading Parliament and misleading the general population of Fiji. As the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>highlighted, he has been involved for decades with Fiji Pine Group and with the Mahogany Trust, not a 
<br/>single cent of money was actually delivered to the landowners, not a single sense of accountability was 
<br/>there, there was so much corruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Hardwood Corporation… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- A Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not a single cent to the landowners, that is wrong, pine leases have been paid to the landowners 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>every year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what we call a pedestrian approach.  He 
<br/>is now saying, “Oh, landowners get leases”, we are not talking about leases.  We are taking about actual 
<br/>returns from the forestation that takes place, about the timber sales.  He knows that no landowner has ever 
<br/>been paid bonus from Fiji Pine. Only under this Government and only under this Prime Minister, we have 
<br/>started paying bonus over close to $40 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister was there last week.  Landowners were happy.  They would not 
<br/>want to have seen you there because of people like you, we had no progress.  If you go to Tropik Woods 
<br/>now, Sir, if you look at the amount of machinery, the technology that is there, no way in your dreams 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would you have dreamt of having such machinery and such technology. So, he continues to do that.  That 
<br/>is his narrative, of course, that is what he is going and spewing out to members of the public, but they are 
<br/>a lot more smarter than what he thinks that they are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to thank, again, the Ministry of Forestry and, please, if they 
<br/>can start thinking outside the box to know that forests do not have to be cut down to be valuable to us.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to remind honourable Bulanauca that during his term 
<br/>with the  Fiji Pine, it  was a negative. They  took  a  loan in  1990 and it was  paid by  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government of $2.2 million to Fiji Pine.  So, the mismanagement of funds was done during your term, 
<br/>honourable Bulanauca.  What did you do for the Fiji Pine industry when you were in the Board?  What 
<br/>did you do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What did you do, tell them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- What did you do?  You did nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, he had been the Minister for Lands for one year.  What did 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he do when he was the Minister for Lands?  What did he do for the Fiji Pine?  Fiji Pine was at a loss. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- There is nothing about my being the Minister for one year.  I was the 
<br/>Minister for one year, we had the Election after one year.  The honourable Prime Minister was Prime 
<br/>Minister for eight years, then we had the Election.  Mr. Speaker, Sir that is the difference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What have you done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  We have done a lot,  we have  established the industry,  raised  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Board and everything else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think he is not reading the articles.  In the 2021 financial 
<br/>year, Fiji Pine made $41.88 million profit and it is just because of our honourable Prime Minister.    What 
<br/></span><span>did you do during the Qarase term, the Rabuka term, did you help the people of this country?  You were 
<br/></span><span>not renewing the leases… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- Non-renewal of leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister, the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  and  also  honourable  Bulanauca  for  his  worst  contribution  in  this 
<br/>Parliament.  Thank you, Sir, I have no further comments to make.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, Parliament will  now vote to note  the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.
