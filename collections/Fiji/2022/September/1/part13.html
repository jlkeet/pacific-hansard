<h3>FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 
<br/>Monday, 29th August, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Fiji Development Bank (Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 47/2022) be debated, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as in the introduction of the motion itself on 
<br/>Monday,  we  had  highlighted  that  this  particular  amendment  to  FDB  Act  seeks  to  remove  the  word 
<br/>“servant” and “servants” from the Act to refer to its “employees” and refer them to “employee” and 
<br/>“employees” as opposed to servants. Servants, as you know, were the terms that were used predominantly 
<br/>during the Colonial period and this is essentially to bring it up into the 21st century.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  Is there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anyone wishing to take the floor?  I have the lists here with your names emblazoned in …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Sorry, Sir, I withdraw. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Anyone else wishing to take the floor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my brief contribution on 
<br/>the  amendment  to  the  Bill  that  is  before  us.    It  may  sound  kind  of  trivial  just  to  change  the  words 
<br/>“servants” to “employees”.  But again it kind of brings to the fore the lightly impact of this trivial change 
<br/>where it is being presented where they are referring to it as something that we took on from Colonial past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Again, we have people serving in this particular instance that have come through a career path 
<br/>that was well mapped out and clear and they were civil servants and servants of the country as a whole, 
<br/>Sir. But again to bring in employee, what are we opening ourselves here to?  That is a question that we 
<br/>would like to raise here. What are we opening ourselves to?  Are we bringing in some other people from 
<br/>outside to be referred to as employees? That is an area that we find it very, very sticky, Sir, and we hope 
<br/>that my colleague who will be speaking after me would be able to highlight this better, but I want to bring 
<br/></span><span>that to the attention of this august Parliament in this “slight amendment” as they put it, but in fact it has 
<br/></span><span>quite a lot of impact on it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to participate in the motion on Bill No. 47 
<br/>of 2022.  I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition with regard to the word “employee” being 
<br/>archaic or Colonial term for public servant.  We have the public service, being a public servant to change 
<br/>it  to  “employees”.    It  is  good  that  it  is  from  the  Fiji  Development  Bank.    I  do  not  know  when  the 
<br/>Government institutions will change the Acts of the ministries to employees.  They are public servants 
<br/>and it is the integrity of that is public servant and we entrust them as a public servant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  public  employee,  now  we  have  a  Ministry  of  Civil  Service,  now  it  is  going  to  be  civil 
<br/>employees, public employees.  You are doing it with FDB, imagine that you are going to transfer this to 
<br/>all the ministries to change the “servants” to “employees”; it is going to be public employees not public 
<br/>servants, it is not going to be Civil Service Ministry but Civil Employees.  What is the secrecy behind 
<br/>this, the honourable Minister went and picked up the FDB.  The FDB has been a national issue by this 
<br/>side of Parliament because of the monies that are guaranteed by the RBF of $200 million, the loans that

<div><span>Fiji Development Bank (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are being done and the appointment of the CEO of Fiji Airways being the Chairman and also the former 
<br/>ANZ Bank employee being appointed in the FDB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out the conversation between you two. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Don’t carry out, you two!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    What  is  the  secrecy  behind  this,  just  to  pin  out  that  word  in  the  Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank Act is something that we really need to know.  The public has to know why the 
<br/>change because after that, they will change all the ministries and departments; that is our worry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir he posed that question and through you, I want to answer 
<br/>that question.  He said, “Why are we changing this?”  This is being changed to be consistent with all other 
<br/>legislations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Anyone else wishing to take the floor?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- No.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is really quite amusing in respect of the 
<br/>contributions by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Rasova.  Honourable Rasova, 
<br/>we are used to his shenanigans and honourable Lalabalavu - FDB staff are not civil servants, they are 
<br/>actually employees of FDB.  I cannot understand why he is saying in his years of experience in Parliament 
<br/>and also as a Minister that he would say that FDB staff are civil servants, they are not.  It is a statutory 
<br/>body and employees of statutory bodies are not civil servants.  So he is fundamentally wrong in that 
<br/>instance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, this whole conspiracy theory about what is going to happen, he may recall that we used 
<br/>to have a law called the Workmen’s Compensation Act.  Honourable Kepa agreed with us when we made 
<br/>an amendment to the actual title of the Act when we called it the “Worker’s Compensation Act” because 
<br/></span><span>workmen’s compensation meant only men who were workers and indeed that is a reflection of how things 
<br/></span><span>used to be.  Women used to stay at home and the men used to go and work, but as we know from the 
<br/>Colonial times, British times and Victorian times ,things have changed highly significantly.  Honourable 
<br/>Lalabalavu I think is caught in a different century altogether now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  …  Honourable  Lalabalavu  I  think  is  caught  in  a  different 
<br/>century altogether now.  He needs to come into the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century as we are bringing all our laws into the 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span> century.  Honourable Rasova said, “Oh, we have the civil service and now they will be called ‘civil 
<br/>employees’”.    We  are  not  changing  the  word  “service”,  we  are  changing  the  word  “servants”  and 
<br/>“servant” which is different to service.   So again, he is kind of caught in his own conundrum, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  So, it is a very basic issue.  We have staff of FDB, young enthusiastic staff, people who are appointed 
<br/>on merit, they are doing fantastically well, they have developed technology, adopted technology and they 
<br/>do not want to be called servants, they want to be called employees and employee. It is very simple as 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir and that is my contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote.
