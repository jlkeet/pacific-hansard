<h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members,  for End of Week Statements, each Member may 
<br/>speak for up to 10 minutes with a 10-minute response by the Minister or Ministers responsible for 
<br/>the subject matter of the Member’s speech.  No seconder is required and there will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I have been advised that the End of Week Statement of the honourable 
<br/>Professor Biman Prasad is withdrawn, therefore I now call on the honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau to 
<br/>deliver his End of Week Statement.  You have the floor, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent Bodies and Commissions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address my End of Week Statement, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to make my contribution on the topic of Independent Bodies and Commissions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, while it is true that a semblance of elections and democracy has come about under the 
<br/></span><span>Constitution, the truth is that Fiji remains a democracy in progress because we are far away from the 
<br/></span><span>promise  of  true  democracy  and  true  equality  promised  by  the  2013  Constitution.    While  the  fast 
<br/>growing array of  Independent  Bodies and Commissions  glitter brightly, playing their roles in the 
<br/>galaxy created by the honourable Attorney-General, the truth is that all that glitters is not gold.  The 
<br/>truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that there is much to be desired in the contributions of these independent 
<br/>commissions,  who  in  the  recently  enacted  budget  received  approximately  $35.3  million  – 
<br/>Independent Bodies and $41.2 million – Independent Commissions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will focus only on a select few - Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission, 
<br/>FICAC,  Online  Safety  Commission,  Electoral  Commission,  Fiji  Elections  Office  and  the  Media 
<br/>Industry and Development Authority (MIDA).   Of all the Independent Bodies and Commissions, the 
<br/>only one that appears truly independent, although the Attorney-General has continued to hack at its 
<br/>independence and professionalism is the Office of the Auditor-General.  Under Section 152 of the 
<br/>Constitution and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“152(1)  At least once in every year, the Auditor-General shall inspect, audit and report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament on -    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)   the public accounts of the State;  
<br/></span><span>(b)  the control of public money and public property; and  
<br/>(c)   all transactions with or concerning the public money or public property of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)  In the report, the Auditor-General must state whether, in his or her opinion –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)  transactions with or concerning the public money or public property of the 
<br/>State has been authorised by or pursuant to this Constitution or any written 
<br/>law; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)  expenditure has been applied to the purpose for which it was authorised.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  witnessed  through  the  various  Committees  and  through  Parliament  the  various 
<br/>Reports  of  the  Auditor-General  presented  where  breaches  resulting  in  millions  of  dollars  in  cost.  
<br/>These reports hold Government and Ministry heads to account but ultimately the buck stops with the 
<br/>Minister.  Government should not be putting undue pressure on the AG’s Office just because they do 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not like it when the truth is exposed.  However, the question is, what happens to the abusers identified 
<br/>and the staff responsible?  If there are financial losses, are these recovered?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the whole audit process to be truly independent, the Public Accounts Committee needs to 
<br/>be adequately staffed, empowered, to institute further investigations and that it should be chaired by 
<br/>the Opposition with the majority from the Opposition.  This should also be applicable to all other 
<br/>Standing Committees so that they could provide more in-depth analysis on issues raised, rather than 
<br/>these ongoing compromises and resulting in mundane predictable Committee Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Parliament,  Standing  Order  51  has  been  totally  abused,  resulting  in  a  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dictatorship rather than a Parliamentary democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Fiji Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission, we hardly see the Director, 
<br/>and he seems to only come out and publicly attack Opposition political parties.  Otherwise, he is in 
<br/>hibernation.  Why is he sitting back and relaxing?  When we were taken in for questioning to the CID 
<br/>Headquarters in relation to the controversy surrounding Bill No. 17, where was he?  Let me quote 
<br/>the Human Rights Activist, Ms. Shamima Ali: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Former Human Rights Commissioner and Human Rights Activist, Ms. Shamima 
<br/></span><span>Ali, has questioned the role and credibility and independence of the Fiji Human Rights 
<br/>and Anti-Discrimination Commission.  She stated that the actions of the Commission’s 
<br/>Director, Ashwin Raj, has become a worry for human rights defenders in the country and 
<br/>internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  part  of  FHRADC’s  mandate  is  to  monitor,  investigate  and  report  on 
<br/>compliance with human rights standards in all aspects of individual lives, the Director has 
<br/>a tendency of focusing more on socio-economic rights, and very little on civil and political 
<br/>rights.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She said and I quote: “that while socio-economic rights were important, they could not be 
<br/>separated from civil and political rights as all human rights were indivisible and inalienable to each 
<br/>other.”  She is the co-ordinator of Fiji Human Rights and also stated that the Commission has failed 
<br/>to comply with the guiding principles that are set out in the PARIS principles of the National Human 
<br/>Rights Institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s Human Rights Anti-Discrimination Commission’s failure to comply creates doubt at its 
<br/></span><span>independence and credibility.  Since its re-establishment post-</span><span>coup</span><span> 2006 the Commission has not 
<br/></span><span>made any genuine step towards compliant with the PARIS principles.  The civic space rating of Fiji 
<br/>by Civicus Monitor remains classified as obstructed.  Sir, FICAC is the </span><span>FijiFirst</span><span> Government regime 
<br/>primary attack dog on Opposition political parties, as we have seen. It is in attack mode these days 
<br/>with  Opposition  politicians  as  parties  are  now  taken  to  task  as  we  approach  Elections.    Hardly 
<br/>anything happens about the Government side when we lodge complaints.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Online Safety Commission, again, it appears to come out to attack Opposition political 
<br/>parties.  Otherwise, it is silent for the rest of the year, or working silently behind the scenes with the 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections to get </span><span>Facebook</span><span> to take down anti-FijiFirst Government groups and pages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It seems that the Electoral Commission only serves at the pleasure of those ‘you know who’ 
<br/>and are promptly removed, and they do exercise their independence as the Electoral Commissioners 
<br/>appointed  in  2013,  discovered  when  they  tried  to  discipline  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  for 
<br/>insubordination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2381 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Elections Office (we have covered this adequately) is led by a power-mad hungry person, 
<br/>whose primary duty is to exploit any weaknesses in the Opposition political parties, while holding 
<br/>the FijiFirst Party to a different standard and bending over backwards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Media Industry Development Authority (MIDA) established by the Media Decree in 
<br/>2010 which hobbles the media, restricts the right to information of citizens and rights of the media, 
<br/>has  been  rightly  condemned  by  all  Opposition  Parties  and  right  thinking  people,  but  has  been 
<br/>basically asleep in the last few years since the media are now truly intimidated and cowed submission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In July 2021, the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights and SPC Human Rights 
<br/>Division  published  a  new  report  analysing  the  human  rights  situation  in  the  Pacific,  highlighting 
<br/>about Fiji that the Public Order Act and the Media Industry Development Act have stifled human 
<br/>rights defenders by criminalising free expression, assembly and association and that the sedition law 
<br/>imposes restrictions on freedom of expression. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate, Sir, that collectively these bodies receive millions and exists solely to protect 
<br/>certain elements in Government, as we see this week and creates more and more laws in an attempt 
<br/>to protect itself from its own failures and tries to guarantee a return to power in this year’s Election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The truth, Sir, is that the FijiFirst Government cannot fool all the people all the time and the 
<br/>time for reckoning has come regarding this independent institution.  The truth, Sir, is that the heart 
<br/>sign has worn off and the people can see clearly how they have not been served by these institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Judiciary, there is a general lack of confidence in the Judiciary and there is a need for 
<br/>an independent review by internationally-recognised review bodies to make recommendations and 
<br/>bring back confidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the Justice William Marshall Petition of 2012 details instances of interference with 
<br/>the Judiciary and FICAC, and so an independent review is long overdue. I reiterate that some of these 
<br/>independent institutions and the people in it are compromised.  The problem is one of legitimacy, 
<br/>and this problem of lack of legitimacy originates from the act of treason in 2006 and the Bainimarama 
<br/></span><span>Coup </span><span>which illegally removed the legitimately elected government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  remind  the  people  of  Fiji  that  the  Courts  declared  the  2006  </span><span>Coup</span><span>  illegal.    The 
<br/>Bainimarama Regime did not accept and, therefore, abrogated the 1997 Constitution, formulated and 
<br/>wrote the 2013 Constitution and imposed that on the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two Elections have been held under this imposed Constitution but nothing will change the 
<br/>fact that the 2013 Constitution and related legal political frameworks are products of a sinful violent 
<br/>act of treason where guns and violence was used.  People suffered and hundreds were victimised.  It 
<br/>was an ungodly and ungracious act - pure and simple!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  corruptive  nature  of  that  act  permeates  through  all  systems  of  Government  today, 
<br/>including  the  so-called  independent  institutions.  The  nation  continues  to  suffer  the  consequences 
<br/>today.  It continues to hang like a black cloud over the nation and is a heavy burden on the sole of 
<br/>our nation. Why? Because the product is that the Government constitutional political system is the 
<br/>illegitimate unrighteous product of a sinful unrighteous act.  Righteousness excels a nation, Sir, but 
<br/>seen as a reproach to people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A </span><span>coup</span><span> goes through a natural cycle, including the act of treason, consolidation, acceptance 
<br/>that it was wrong and unrighteous.  You conduct a review consensus and validation by the people, 
<br/>their national acceptance and legitimisation.  That was what happened with the Rabuka </span><span>coup</span><span> in 1987.

<div><span>their national acceptance and legitimisation.  That was what happened with the Rabuka </span><span>coup</span><span> in 1987.  
<br/>Imposition of the 1992 Constitution, the Constitution Review Commission and bipartisan basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are going over time, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That is, Sir, what needs to be done and I am calling on the leaders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today to follow the path in order for us to move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I end by wishing you, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, and all honourable Members of Parliament, all the best in the Elections and we 
<br/>shall leave the outcome to be decided by the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thought  the  honourable  Member  was 
<br/>actually going to make some useful contribution on independent institutions.  However, as usual, he 
<br/>cannot let go of his obsession about this Constitution and, indeed, the so-called illegality of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he chose to select a few independent institutions but before that, I would 
<br/>like to highlight to Parliament that for the first time, independent institutions in Fiji actually have 
<br/></span><span>separate budget items. In the Budget Estimates, Sir, you will see that under Head 9 and Head 13, we 
<br/></span><span>have one-line items that have been allocated to these independent bodies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why they have one-line item, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because they have the ability to 
<br/>look after their own finances.  It is not set out by the Government machinery and in that way, they 
<br/>are truly independent – the Office of the Auditor-General, the Fijian Elections Office, the Judiciary, 
<br/>Parliament,  Office  of  the  DPP,  Media  Industry  Development  Authority,  and  the  Independent 
<br/>Commissions  –  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination  Commission,  the  Constitutional  Offices 
<br/>Commission,  FICAC,  Public  Services  Commission,  Accident  Compensation  Commission  of  Fiji 
<br/>(ACCF),  Legal  Aid,  Online  Safety  Commission,  Electoral  Commission,  Fijian  Competition  and 
<br/>Consumer Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the honourable Member bothered to be genuine in his contributions, he would have actually 
<br/>acknowledged the fact that we have these independent institutions that actually now have complete 
<br/>control over their finances.  For example, when we do formulate the Budget, we do not come and tell 
<br/>Parliament how to spend their money, it is up to them.  They have complete control over it, and the 
<br/>same with the Judiciary.  Before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if they looked at the Estimates, we have set out 
<br/>exactly how much money Judiciary could spend.  Now, they have a one-line item which gives them 
<br/></span><span>further financial independence too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Member  talked  about  the  Human  Rights  Commission.  
<br/>Again, as usual, he quoted someone else, who quoted someone else and other people.  He never has 
<br/>any original thinking himself, nor any sort of intellectual input himself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination  Commission  is  an 
<br/>independent body.  They do not focus on civil and political rights, but only focus on socio-economic 
<br/>rights.  But as he had pointed out himself and I hope he understood what he said, these rights were 
<br/>indivisible, in other words, you cannot only focus on one and not focus on the other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Constitution,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  fact,  for  the  first  time  ever  in  any  Fijian 
<br/>Constitution, we actually have socio-economic rights.   We have rights,  for example, for housing, 
<br/>access to water, economic participation, access to transport and connectivity with portable water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, together with that, we have the civil and political rights.  They are equally 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2383 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as important as each other.  If people are hungry or if people do not have connections to electricity, 
<br/>those discriminatory provisions or those lack of accessibility to  those fundamental  rights  actually 
<br/>causes civil and political issues.  That is how people are actually able to exploit them.  So this is why 
<br/>these rights are indivisible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> He said, “Oh, they do not focus on civil and political rights.” He is talking about Ashwin 
<br/>Raj.  The problem with the Opposition is that, they personalise things.  They attacked Ashwin Raj.  
<br/>Honourable Professor Prasad attacked Ashwin Raj.  Honourable Qereqeretabua, in a very (I thought) 
<br/>disgusting manner, attacked the Supervisor of Elections, calling him all sorts of names.  That is the 
<br/>calibre of contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just thinking last night when I went home that they were attacking 
<br/>and  undermining  the  electoral  system,  attacking  and  undermining  the  Electoral  Commission, 
<br/>attacking  and  undermining  the  Supervisor  of  Elections,  so  hypothetically,  what  if  they  won  the 
<br/>Elections?  They are saying that they want to win the Elections.  Honourable Gavoka is saying they 
<br/>will win the Elections.  So, what if they win the Elections?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suddenly,  Saneem  who  is  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  would  be  alright,  the  Electoral 
<br/></span><span>Commission  would  be  alright,  suddenly  the  Electoral  System  would  be  alright  as  well  as  the 
<br/></span><span>Constitution.  What leg do they have to stand on?  They would have zero legs to stand on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why we have continuously said, “Please, if you are patriotic Fijians, if you believe in 
<br/>a sustainable democracy, do not attack independent institutions.”  There is a fundamental premise of 
<br/>running any country.  They go and berate those institutions and the system, yet they want to compete 
<br/>or participate in the political sphere in that same system.  They never thought about the fact that they 
<br/>are undermining continuously, what if they won?  It would be such a hypocritical position.  They are 
<br/>all looking like stunned mullets. That is the real issue that you have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, the Supervisor of Elections has actually made this clear in the past 
<br/>couple  of  days.    The  same  thing  with  honourable  Professor  Prasad,  he  stood  on  the  floor  of  this 
<br/>Parliament and he lied.  He said you lodged a number of complaints about FijiFirst but none of them 
<br/>have actually come to the fore.  Therefore, it is in the public interest for the Supervisor of Elections 
<br/>to tell members of the public that to protect his institution and protect its independence, that it is 
<br/>actually a lie.  They have not lodged any complaints because what they are trying to perpetuate on 
<br/>the floor of this Parliament is  that,  “We have lodged this  complaint, somehow or the other these 
<br/>people are not attending to it.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Tuisawau  has  done  exactly  the  same  thing  today.    No  complaints  have  been 
<br/>lodged.  Even the ones that were lodged, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are frivolous and vexatious.  If they 
<br/>themselves cannot adhere to the laws or regulations, that is their problem.   If we see another political 
<br/>party breach one, we will complain about it.  That is our right to do so, in the same way it is their 
<br/>right to lodge a complaint.  But do not lodge a complaint for the sake for it.  You need to adhere to 
<br/>the laws.  We adhered to the laws, so if we are greatly compliant with the laws, do not blame us for 
<br/>it, you go and look into your own house.  Look at the billboards, the signage that you have, meeting 
<br/>notices, several of them are non-compliant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have people telling us from New Zealand that Rabuka is having dinner functions to raise 
<br/>funds.  People are simply going at the door, paying money, no one’s name is registered and they just 
<br/>take the money. If they are able to do that with one single individual, imagine what they are going to 
<br/>do with others.  What amount of money has been laundered? What amount of money has been given 
<br/>by people without a registration of who is giving the money?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People have the right to give the money, that is their right, no one is saying that.  All we are 
<br/>saying is that, the person gives money, you need to know who it is.  We need to know that it is not 
<br/>coming from business, we need to know that it is not coming from a non-Fijian or non-former Fijian. 
<br/>It is very simple, just comply with the laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, another fallacy, honourable Tuisawau.  He went on about the Media 
<br/>Industry  Development  Act.    We  have  said  several  times  and  they  have  the  ability,  they  have  the 
<br/>intellect to go and check themselves.  There used to be an organisation called the Media Council 
<br/>which was made up of media companies in Fiji and it was self-regulatory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  look  at  Schedule  1  and  Schedule  2  of  the  Media  Industry  Development  Act  about 
<br/>standards, it is verbatim the same standards that the Media Council had, they have not bothered to 
<br/>check that.  It talks about standards.  How do you portray children?  How do your portray sex?  How 
<br/>do you classify TV programmes?  All of those things are there, verbatim.  Yet, they are going on as 
<br/>it some stuff has been brought out from the neither regions of someone’s anatomy and put in there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, exactly the facts are there, yet they have this narrative and he has actually 
<br/>abused his End of Week Statement.  He talked about independent bodies, but has made a political 
<br/></span><span>statement about it.  He went on about Judiciary, I challenge him to say that outside this Parliament. 
<br/></span><span>There is not a lack of confidence about Judiciary, in fact, it has been enhanced.  We now have more 
<br/>rural sittings in more maritime areas, in the rural areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We now have more Judges 
<br/>in the Western Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Western  Division,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  generated  the  bulk  of  the  Fijian  economy  - 
<br/>tourism, pine, gold, sugar, but they had only one Civil Judge and  only one Criminal Judge for the 
<br/>entire Western Division starting at Korolevu in Nadroga, all the way up to Ra - one Judge for civil 
<br/>matter and one Judge  for criminal matter.  Honourable Waqanika will confirm that. Today, they have 
<br/>four or five Judges.  That is what you mean, access to justice. Today, we have Legal Aid being given 
<br/>access of $5 million.  People who are on the bottom end of the socio-economic scale are able to get 
<br/>access to justice.  They have not mentioned that at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have rooms for feeding mothers. The Legal Aid Commission Officers can go and draft 
<br/>your Wills for people who may not be that wealthy but they may have a house or may have a car. It 
<br/>gives some level  of comfort,  solace and  certainty to  the family. They  get represented in  criminal 
<br/>matters.  Abhorrent as a crime as may be that they are accused of, yet they get legal representation.  
<br/>They have not mentioned that at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  challenge  honourable  Tuisawau  to  give  one  single  instance  where  they  have  found  the 
<br/>Judiciary to be corrupt. I challenge him to say that.  In the same way, we have challenged them since 
<br/>2014 to  say,  “Where in  the electoral  system  -  electoral  process has there been some shenanigans 
<br/>going on that is not above board.”  To-date, they have not provided a single shred of evidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, they are saying that about the Judiciary.  When they do not like decisions, 
<br/>they  said  that,  that  particular  body  is  not  independent.    When  they  like  the  decision,  the  body  is 
<br/>alright.  So, this is the level of personal analysis that takes place, and this is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it 
<br/>is highly unpatriotic.  It is not leadership-like quality to be able to constantly undermine independent 
<br/>bodies when they are completely independent. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importance of a Knowledge-Based Economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my End of Week Statement on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importance of a knowledge-based economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2385 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the concept of a knowledge-based economy was coined to recognise the 
<br/>importance  of  knowledge,  information,  and  ideas  as  a  key  source  of  economic  growth  and 
<br/>development.    Technological  changes,  innovation  and  human  capital  advancements  drive  the 
<br/>development of a knowledge based economy.  Most of us would have heard this old saying, ‘give 
<br/>man a fish, you feed him for day, but teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a life time.’  But, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you provide him or her with the technology and the market linkage, you feed the 
<br/>entire nation and the region.  That is knowledge economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enhancing  human  capital  through  information  technology  and  innovation  offers  endless 
<br/>productivity gains, which is a key ingredient driving the success and development of many economies 
<br/>around  the  world.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  be  able  to  fully  participate  in  knowledge  economy  the 
<br/>following four pillars are important: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education and training - an educated and skilled workforce is needed to create, share and 
<br/>use knowledge; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Information  infrastructure  -  a  dynamic  information  infrastructure  ranging  from  radio  to 
<br/>internet is required to facilitate the effective communication and processing of information; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right  economic  incentive  and  institutional  regime,  where  regulatory  and  the  economic 
<br/>environment  enables  the  free  flow  of  knowledge  and  support  investments  in  ICT  and 
<br/>encourages entrepreneurship, which is central to the knowledge economy; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Innovations  systems  -  network  of  research  centres,  universities,  think  tanks,  private 
<br/>enterprises  and  community  groups  is  necessary  to  tap  into  the  growing  stop  of  global 
<br/>knowledge and assimilate and adopt it to local needs and create knowledge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is a young country with the 70 percent of the population below the age 
<br/>of 40 years.  This is the greatest asset we have as a nation, with the significant investment in human 
<br/>capital development and ICT development.  We are in the right path to harness this great asset and 
<br/>tap in to the knowledge economy.  The Bainimarama Government, since 2013 started with the bold 
<br/>investment to revolutionise human capital development by providing free education to every single 
<br/>Fijian, at the early child hood, primary and secondary levels.  Not only this, we have been providing 
<br/>transportation assistance, free text books and invested millions to improve the learning infrastructure 
<br/>and school environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All this ensures that no-one is left behind, no matter what their socio economic status is, no 
<br/></span><span>matter where they live, no matter who they are including their gender, culture and ethnicity for that 
<br/>matter, and the females are no longer marginalised.  Previously, females were the first ones to drop 
<br/>out if parents could not afford their child’s education.  Today, it is no longer the case.  We are taking 
<br/>everyone together by providing them with equal opportunity, we are empowering them with skills 
<br/>and knowhow required to be successful to make sure the country is successful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had many significant investments in tertiary education with the 
<br/>provision of scholarships and TELS.  Never before have we had this unprecedented level of access 
<br/>to tertiary education.  Many Fijians have told us that had it not been the support provided by the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government, they or their sons, daughters and their grandchildren would have never 
<br/>been able to afford tertiary studies.  Today, we have more females graduating in both under graduate 
<br/>and post graduate levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, data shows that since the establishment of TSLS, more females have qualified from 
<br/>the scholarships and study loans.  This is true empowerment.  But we have to keep this sustainable.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reckless  promise  to  make  tertiary  education  fully  free  is  unsustainable.    Such  policies  are  just 
<br/>populism and pie-in-the-sky kind of promise from a political party that is struggling to be relevant or 
<br/>should I now say, struggling for its own existence.  Apart from tertiary education, Mr. Speaker, Sir…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We shall soon see.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  We  are  also  increasing  our  focus  on  technical  and  vocational  areas  as 
<br/>demand for these skills require increase due to our own development needs and more recently, given 
<br/>the outflow of skills to Australia, New Zealand and other countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government in its recent budget provided funding for the development 
<br/>of  a  10-year  Human  Capital  Development  Plan.    An  international  expert  in  human  capital 
<br/>development  and labour  market  has been engaged to  lead the development  plan.  This  work  will 
<br/>stocktake our current human resources capital status, scope labour market demands for the next 10 
<br/>years, identify investment priorities through scholarships and study loans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having a human capital development plan is one of the fundamentals to demonstrate globally 
<br/>on  the  seriousness  of  our  pursuit.    In  the  current  budget,  the  Government  has  established  a  new 
<br/></span><span>scheme such as upgrade of post-graduate, masters and PhD levels.  These are all culminating towards 
<br/></span><span>the development of a knowledge economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Information infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the education and training, a dynamic 
<br/>ICT infrastructure and connectivity is equally important for knowledge-based economy.  Fiji as a 
<br/>nation has made great progress and 95 percent of Fijians today have access to mobile and internet 
<br/>connectivity.   Mobile phone costs have come down significantly over the last few years. Internet 
<br/>speed in Fiji is better than many comparable countries and cost is much cheaper.  We have more 
<br/>mobile phones in the country than adult population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digital  wallets  like  M-PAiSA,  MyCash  have  now  become  a  key  feature  in  our  financial 
<br/>transaction platforms.  I am not promoting them; these are the realities on the ground.  Our online 
<br/>payments and online services have also become equally prominent.   All these did not happen by 
<br/>themselves.  It was the reforms and investments by the Bainimarama Government in the ICT sector 
<br/>that enabled this progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Bainimarama  Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 
<br/>telecommunications  sector.    Prior  to  this,  we  had  a  monopolistic  arrangement  which  stifled 
<br/></span><span>innovation and meant fewer choices for Fijians with exorbitant charges.  After the opening up, we 
<br/></span><span>saw  new  entrants  in  the  market,  competition  picked  up  and  mobile  phone  charges  came  down 
<br/>significantly.  All these greatly helped improve overall efficiency in the economy and create new 
<br/>pathways for better and cheaper service delivery for Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>liberalised  and  opened  up 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we go ahead Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need more investments in this area.  We need  to be 
<br/>mindful  that  while  digital  connectivity  is  the  greatest  equaliser,  it  can  become  the  greatest  dis-
<br/>equaliser too.  That is why our Government is spending millions to connect to rural schools and rural 
<br/>communities  to  ensure  that  no  one  is  left  behind.    A  regulatory  and  economic  arrangement  that 
<br/>enables innovation by supporting investment and free information flow is also critical together with 
<br/>education, training and availability of ICT infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  a  Constitution  that  protects  the  rights  of  everyone  and  ensures 
<br/>security, stability in the country.  We have strong laws to protect property rights and maintain the 
<br/>rule of law.  We have an independent judiciary that can enforce contracts.  We have a conducive 
<br/>business environment with low taxes and streamlined business processes to entice new investment 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2387 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and further support investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are investing billions of dollars in modernising our infrastructure, connecting people to 
<br/>roads, electricity, water and other utilities.  We have invested in our airports, our national airline, in 
<br/>our seaports to improve connectivity. We have brought in strategic partners in entities like EFL and 
<br/>Fiji Ports that will help further modernise these critical service providers.  These investments Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  is  to  ensure  that  we  create  an  enabling  environment  for  business  that  can  support 
<br/>innovation and a knowledge-based economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also need to invest more in research and innovation and explore how 
<br/>best  we  can  further  incentivize  and  help  patent  creations,  intellectual  property,  new  research, 
<br/>knowledge  creation,  local  software  developments  and  commodification  of  knowledge  into  new 
<br/>products.  While knowledge creation is important for small developing countries like Fiji, even more 
<br/>important is our country being able to import and learn new technology and ideas from the already 
<br/>available pool of global knowledge and technology adapted to local needs.  The universities, think 
<br/>tanks, private enterprises and community groups play a pivotal role here. We need to become agile 
<br/>to be able to adopt new role, better technologies and more collaboration with countries that have done 
<br/>well in these areas and will be beneficial. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  knowledge-based  economy  is  characterised  by  the 
<br/>presence of a higher percentage of highly skilled employees whose jobs require special knowledge 
<br/>or  skills.    Unlike  in  the  past,  when  the  economy  depended  heavily  on  unskilled  labourers  and 
<br/>consisted primarily of producing physical goods, the modern economy is comprised more of service 
<br/>industries and jobs that require thinking and analysis of data.   The modern economy is also known 
<br/>as the post-industrial economy or the information economy, in reference to the central importance of 
<br/>information technology in the economies of developed nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  new  knowledge-based  economy  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  most  valuable  assets  that  a 
<br/>country owns is often intangible assets such as patents, copyrights or proprietary software processes.  
<br/>It  is  in  contrast  to  previous  economic  epochs  such  as  the  agrarian  economy,  where  the  land  was 
<br/>usually  the  primary  asset  and  the  industrial  economy  where  manufacturing  plants  and  equipment 
<br/>were the key assets for most businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-You have overrun your time honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Just about to conclude Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  knowledge-based  economy  supports  and  is  fuelled  by  innovation  research,  and  rapid 
<br/>technological  advancements.    The  overwhelming  majority  of  workers  in  a  knowledge-based 
<br/>economy are very much computer literate and skilled at creating business and financial models. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an increasing emphasis on data collection and analysis and on the development of 
<br/>algorithms and artificial intelligence.  Harvard Business School Professor, Mr. Michael Porter, argues 
<br/>that in today’s economy, the ability of a business to develop and maintain a competitive advantage 
<br/>in the workplace is more dependent on the ability to quickly adapt to an ever-changing world.  The 
<br/>bottom line is that knowledge provides the foundation to be able to compete in the modern global 
<br/>economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the transition from an industrial or service-driven economy to a knowledge-based 
<br/>economy is not without challenges and the process is a long one.  All these unprecedented advances 
<br/>in human resources, ICT’s and access to free education is on the right track.  While others talk and 
<br/>promise the moon and the stars, FijiFirst, under the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delivers what is required and is just.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief as honourable Sachida 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nand has eaten into my time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  point  that  I  would  like  to  make  very  quickly  is  that  not  all 
<br/>countries  can  immediately  become  what  we  call  knowledge-based  societies  where  we  have 
<br/>everything is based on technology. A country like Fiji of course, and numerous other countries have 
<br/>a mixture of what may be called (in a rudimentary manner) agrarian economies plus technological 
<br/>economies  or  knowledge-based  economies.    What  it  does  give  us  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  prime 
<br/>opportunity to be able to take advantage of both and you are able to do the transition.  So, for example 
<br/>if Fiji is focused a lot on agriculture we need to be able to ensure that we use the technology to be 
<br/>able to enhance the productive capacity in the agricultural sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that we need to make that we can get from his statement is 
<br/>that we need to be very strategic about it.  We need to be able to take a holistic approach to it.  We 
<br/>have seen honourable Members from the other side just talk about one particular sector but it is also 
<br/>about taking a very holistic perspective in respect of creating a knowledge-based economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are certain fundamental issues that needs to exist before you have a knowledge-based 
<br/>economy.  One of them, of course, is that you need to have a legal framework that actually gives 
<br/>people the opportunity, the confidence to be able to be creative, innovative, to have what we call a 
<br/>market place of ideas.  We need to be able to enhance the potential of individuals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are actually very lucky as honourable Sachida Nand had highlighted, that 70 percent of 
<br/>our  population  are  below  the  age  of  40  and  65  percent  are  below  the  age  of  35.    M-PAiSA,  for 
<br/>example the programme for that was written by someone from Labasa who worked at Vodafone. So, 
<br/>there  are  numerous  hidden  talents  that  exist  in  Fiji.    Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  a 
<br/>historical basis of where we have not assessed or judged our people or enhanced knowledge and the 
<br/>capacity of people, from the individual assessments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have lumped people in ethnic groups. If we look at our immigrations forms, before the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister directed us to change it (post 5</span><span>th</span><span>December, 2006) it used to say if Fiji 
<br/>citizen - if I’m migrating - name your race, Indian, Fijian, Others, is what we used to have.  They did 
<br/>not say are you a doctor, engineer, nurse so we know who we are losing, or we know who we are 
<br/>gaining. That is what you need to have a knowledge-based economy because it is a market place of 
<br/></span><span>ideas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For any country to be mature as far as a knowledge-based economy is concerned, we need to 
<br/>be able to give people the opportunity and the environment to harness out those ideas.  A classic 
<br/>point is Professor Paresh Narayan who recently helped set FNU up with the Climate Change Research 
<br/>School or the school that is going to be there.  He is one of the 500 most cited researchers in the 
<br/>world. This Professor came from Navua from Vashist Muni Memorial School, went to MGM, went 
<br/>to Suva Muslim School, to USP, and was a Gold Medallist at Monash University.  And we were told 
<br/>by him that when he was at USP, and wanted to do his PhD, one of the Professors we know very well 
<br/>said to him in Hindi, what are you going to do by doing a PhD.  No point doing a PhD.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today he is one of the 500 most cited researchers in the world.  He has come back to Fiji 
<br/>because he believes the right environment exists.  He believes that he will be judged on what he can 
<br/>contribute not by his ethnicity so we need to understand that. People need to be judged on that basis 
<br/>if we want to create a truly knowledge-based economy.  In the same way honourable Sachida Nand 
<br/>highlighted, that today we now have more females in high schools and university because of free 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>education.  You need to provide the right legal framework. You need to have, as we highlighted, the 
<br/>right judicial system in place, all the independent institutions need to function well and we need to 
<br/>be able to give people the opportunity to say “yes, I am free to use my mind, my mental capacity.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, common and equal citizenry does matter. Calling people </span><span>vulagi</span><span> does matter because it 
<br/>alienates people.  Honourable Gavoka, stands up and says </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span> - he cannot even say Fijian 
<br/>Citizens.   Section 5 of the Constitution says we are all Fijian Citizens.  These are the things that 
<br/>makes people more patriotic. They want to contribute. They see this is their country.  If you see this 
<br/>is your country, you will want to contribute but every second day you get told you do not belong 
<br/>here, what will they do?  They will use their brain cells, their skills set and they will go.  If people 
<br/>are not being appointed through OMRS they will not contribute fully well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I also wish to make is that the honourable Sachida Nand talked about the 
<br/>information technology. That of course is critically important. Today Ministry of Agriculture and 
<br/>various  other  organisations  are  now  using  this  opportunity,  where  we  have  95  percent  of  Fijians 
<br/>actually connected to be able to give them access to technology.  Farmers can be given information 
<br/>on the kind of soil that is required.  We now have </span><span>Walesi</span><span>. There are certain channels that are dedicated 
<br/>to increasing the knowledge information that can be imparted to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  hand,  Sir,  we  have  the  Business  Process  Outsourcing  (BPO)  sector  that  has 
<br/>developed  highly  significantly.  From  a  Government  perspective  strategically,  for  example,  as 
<br/>announced in the Budget, we are landing a second submarine cable in the Western Division. A million 
<br/>dollars is being allocated in the Budget because we need to build redundancies. If we have one cable 
<br/>down the other one will actually work.  It will also mean a lot more companies will be attracted to 
<br/>come to Fiji because redundancies have been built in.  There some very fundamental issues like we 
<br/>talked  about  the  other  day,  access  to  electricity,  but  also  having  a  redundancy  in  terms  of 
<br/>infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have of course a number of initiatives that are on foot, the honourable 
<br/>Sachida Nand also talked about many of them and in the interest of time, I would like to end there 
<br/>but essentially we need to tap into the skillsets, innovation, creative thinking of our young people 
<br/>and that is precisely what we are doing by giving them access to free education from early childhood 
<br/>to Year 13, giving access to university studies and also saying to them “Please go out and be creative, 
<br/>please go out and think of new ideas”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are various tax incentives that we put in place; 30 year, 20 year tax holidays that has 
<br/></span><span>been put  in  place and  we look  forward to  that  giving us a lot more enhancement in  terms  of our 
<br/></span><span>productivity, in terms of the growth of our GDP and we have the wonderful opportunity where we 
<br/>are in the transition stage from  agrarian-based society to what we call a “technological” based society 
<br/>but we have the wonderful opportunity to be able to merge them all to be able to take advantage of 
<br/>both the sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ICTs in Fiji’s Rural and Maritime Areas  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for this opportunity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>given to me to deliver my End of Week Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Information and Communication Technologies or ICTs play a momentum 
<br/>role in all aspects of our society changing the way in which we communicate with each other, how 
<br/>we  access  information,  work,  conduct  business,  engage  with  Government  agencies  and  how  we 
<br/>manage our social life.  The COVID-19 pandemic has optimise the shift to online spaces.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past ever since independence the rural and maritime areas in Fiji had 
<br/>always  faced  challenges  of  poor  ICT  infrastructure  development  handicapped  by  the  distance 
<br/>especially  in  case  of  scattered  island  groups,  mountainous  terrains  and  lack  of  supporting 
<br/>infrastructure such as electricity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Government  has  turned  these  challenges  into  opportunities  and  use 
<br/>various tools such as satellites and imaging technologies and the use of solar power energy sources 
<br/>to connect these communities both to mobile network and internet connectivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ability and accessibility of high quality affordable ICT services in Fiji 
<br/>is essential to promote innovation, economic growth and development.  I would like to focus on the 
<br/>two areas in which ICTs have benefitted the rural and maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly the connectivity access empowers our people and provides for closer 
<br/>interaction with government agencies for example parents of a newborn in Wainikoro, in the interior 
<br/>of Vanua Levu instead of going to the BDM office to register the newborn can begin this process 
<br/>online through Digital Fiji platform from their home.  They can book their appointment online and 
<br/>go to their nearest BDM office to verify the details and pick the birth certificate in one visit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, instead of cash pay-out, members of landowning units receive their equal 
<br/>land lease monies directly in their bank accounts from the iTaukei Land Trust Board.  The use of 
<br/>mobile e-wallet have also significantly increase the economic participation of people in the rural and 
<br/>maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  current  roll  out  of  the  Inflation  Mitigation  is  being  paid  out 
<br/>predominantly  over  95  percent  through  money  wallets  which  requires  connectivity  to  mobile 
<br/>networks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  secondly  access  to  connectivity  enables  timely  access  to  information, 
<br/>uncensored to accurate and verified information, this equips people to make better informed decision 
<br/>about their lives.  For example the online portal for the laws of Fiji which was launched in 2016 has 
<br/>the most up-to-date laws as they are passed or amended by this Parliament.  Fijians do not have to 
<br/>visit the law firms to pay them to have access to the provisions of a particular law, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>This is available right at their fingertips. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, live Parliament sessions are broadcasted on the dedicated </span><span>Walesi</span><span> Digital TV platform 
<br/></span><span>and the </span><span>Walesi </span><span>Mobile App whereby our most remote and maritime communities have access to as 
<br/></span><span>well,  from  the  comfort  of  their  homes.    Therefore,  it  is  critically  important  that  as  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, we are making accurate and factual statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing remarks, Government intends to continue to make ICT widely 
<br/>available  in  Fiji  including  the  most  remote  parts  of  the  country  and  I  am  confident  that  the 
<br/>Government will deliver on its promises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for his End of Week Statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  absolutely  critical  that  we  connect  people  in  the  rural  areas  as  the 
<br/>statement that was  made by honourable Sachida  Nand which is  essentially  paraphrasing what  we 
<br/>have said previously; that the digital connectivity can be one of the greatest equalisers but it can also 
<br/>be the greatest disequalisers if you do not connect those who are on the periphery of the geographical 
<br/>landscape of connectivity.

<div><span>We have places like in Kadavu, Sir, that may have a small village but it may connect half a 
<br/>million dollars to connect 30 people to the internet or to mobile phone connectivity.  Mobile phone 
<br/>companies will not go there because it does not make commercial sense to them.  So Government 
<br/>actually has put in money to connect those places.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  that  basis  identified  the  number  of  areas  as  also  highlighted  to 
<br/>Parliament.  For example, we have a list of areas that have been gazetted and I hope they read these 
<br/>gazettes.    There  are  240  sites  that  include  for  example  a  place  in  Ba,  Bua,  quite  a  few  places  in 
<br/>Cakaudrove.  In  Kadavu  a  lot  of  places,  Lau  includes  Kabara,  Moala,  Fulaga,  Lomaloma,  Moce, 
<br/>Totoya) , Kubulau, and then of course in Lomaiviti including Sawaieke, Koro; then we have Naitasiri 
<br/>(quite a few places), Namosi a number of places, Navosa, a few places in Tailevu and the island of 
<br/>Vatulele and Wainunu in Bua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are about 240 sites and I urge the honourable Members to go and read the gazette.  We 
<br/>have already gazetted these areas, of these areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this year’s budget there are 
<br/>about 90 locations where they will either have towers put up what we call “repeater stations’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we plan to have these 90 places at the end of this financial year connected, 
<br/></span><span>already tenders have been put out into the public space and we hope to have the works start very 
<br/></span><span>soon.    The  reason  why  we  are  going  out  to  the  private  sector,  Sir,  is  because  we  can  then 
<br/>simultaneously have made different locations being connected for mobile phone connectivity but it 
<br/>is also noted about mobile phone connectivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to very quickly highlight a few things: As has been mentioned 
<br/>on the floor of Parliament quite a few times that the telecommunications sector in Fiji was very stifled 
<br/>in the sense it was very monopolistic. They had exclusive licence for Vodafone, exclusive licence 
<br/>for TFL,  exclusive licence for what  was then Cable and Wireless or FINTEL.   Sir, FINTEL was 
<br/>owned about 49 percent for memory by Cable and Wireless which is an English based company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Bainimarama-led Government we have what we call the Radisson 
<br/>Accord Agreement. I still remember quite clearly we spent  about three days and three nights, we 
<br/>have reached an agreement, we had support from the World Bank Advisors, we reached an agreement 
<br/>around about 2.00 a.m. or 4.00 a.m. We then subsequently roll out the new laws that were put in 
<br/>place, we brought in experts from overseas and today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our connectivity through 
<br/>smart phones is as low as FJ$99; data plans for one gigabyte for as low as FJ40 cents ($0.40).  All 
<br/>these have led Fiji to being transformed into digital economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the data plans of one GB go for as low as 40 cents making Fiji the third 
<br/>cheapest country for internet plans in the world.  The cheapest is Israel where one gigabyte of data 
<br/>cost approximately 10 cents followed by Kyrgyzstan where it is 20 cents Fijian and we are about 40 
<br/>cents.  These are some of the strides that have been made and unfortunately some people may not 
<br/>necessarily understand this, that internet connectivity plans et cetera are a lot more expensive in our 
<br/>neighbouring countries, not just Pacific but countries like Australia and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced in Parliament previously, we have what we call the Northern 
<br/>connectivity  programme  for  40  schools  and  health  centres  where  we  supply  and  install  electrical 
<br/>solution  such  as  solar  power  where  they  do  not  connect  it  to  the  grid.    We  supply  and  install 
<br/>connectivity equipment including routers, antenna assistance, modems, satellite kits and necessary 
<br/>equipment  to  facilitate  internet  connection  supply;  and  we  saw  peripherals  such  as  computers, 
<br/>webcams, headsets, printers and equipment to be used by beneficiaries and internet bandwidth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the beneficiaries I have a whole list of 40 of them, I do not intent

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to read out, we will put it up on the Government </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page for everyone to see.  Out of these 40 
<br/>sites,  it  is  very  empowering  if  you  were  there  at  a  lot  of  these  places,  26  of  them  had  in  fact 
<br/>communities living around the schools.  Some of them the villages are right next door, we had nursing 
<br/>stations where people are living close by, we have civil servants living close by, so what we have 
<br/>done is we Wi-Fi the entire school compound that people from the village can come and sit in the 
<br/>school compound and get connected to the internet, get connected to viber and WhatsApp.  They 
<br/>apply for Government services on their phones and that is what we have done as far as those schools 
<br/>and nursing stations are concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  estimated  that  about  10,000  primary  and  secondary  school  students  in  the  Northern 
<br/>Division were connected as a result of this internet connectivity and about 7,000 Fijians living in 
<br/>communities around these schools have actually been connected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  2022-2023  financial  year  which  is  now,  80  schools  have  been 
<br/>identified of which 49 schools will be connected as phase 2 of the project.  Out of that, we will have 
<br/>approximately  30  schools  being  connected  this  year  (31  in  fact)  and  they  have  been  highlighted 
<br/>through and we worked with the Ministry of Education.  The number of schools have been connected 
<br/>including in the islands too where the schools as remote as Naitavuni, Nukuiya, Turagabeci Primary 
<br/></span><span>School and Totoya District School et cetera - they have all been connected or will be connected this 
<br/></span><span>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, we have now the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform and I think the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Opposition  have  sort  of  ridiculed  that.    The  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  platform,  essentially,  there  are  about  seven 
<br/>channels. One of them of course is televising all parliamentary sessions, when we are not sitting, they 
<br/>actually highlight the Committee Sittings, they highlight reruns of parliamentary sittings.  A lot of 
<br/>Fijians are getting access to this information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then we have an educational channel, we have a faith based channel, which is called ‘Hope’ 
<br/>then we have three channels by the </span><span>FBC</span><span>, we have a couple of channel by </span><span>Fiji One</span><span> and we have </span><span>Mai 
<br/>TV</span><span>.  Before </span><span>Mai TV</span><span>, for example, which I know some of the Opposition Members have appeared on 
<br/>they were only confined to Suva-Nausori corridor.  Today, anyone is connected to </span><span>Walesi</span><span> in Lau can 
<br/>watch </span><span>Mai TV</span><span> because they are all free to air channels.  This is what we call giving people access to 
<br/>information, empowering them with information to make informed and right choices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>Walesi</span><span> is also in the next phase where we will be able to then have messages 
<br/>coming either way too.   As we have seen, they have also been very instrumental in connecting a 
<br/></span><span>number of schools to the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> channels because of the education channels.  We also give free set 
<br/></span><span>of box for those households that earn less than $30,000 and you can be rest assured that most in the 
<br/>rural areas actually get this new sets of boxes that have been given to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point we wish to make also is that, the areas that have been allocated 
<br/>under the gazette notice - how it is funded.  We take a small percentage of the profits of mobile phone 
<br/>companies and we put it in a Trust Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have recently amended the law to ensure that some more of it can be used for connectivity.  
<br/>Government then allocates funding towards that and the models that we have now adopted, Sir, is 
<br/>that when we put up a tower, it is not going to be exclusively Digicel or exclusively Vodafone.  Both 
<br/>the companies should be on the tower and should give the consumers a choice because as we have 
<br/>seen, sometimes Digicel has a better data plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vodafone may be has a better voice plan, as a customer I should be able to have that choice 
<br/>even though I may be living in some remote part in Kadavu or Lau I still should have that choice and

<div><span>2393 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by giving people the choice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and giving them connectivity, we are empowering all 
<br/>Fijians  and  in  particular  as  a  subject  matter  of  this  particular  End  of  Week  Statement  it  is  about 
<br/>connecting  those  people  in  the  rural  and  remote  areas  because  they  must  be  brought  from  the 
<br/>periphery into the centre.
