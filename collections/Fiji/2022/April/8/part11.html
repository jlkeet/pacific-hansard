<div><span>Rural Electrification Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 89/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 
<br/>Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  the  current  status  of  the  Rural  Electrification 
<br/>Programme implemented by Energy  Fiji  Limited and funded through an  annual  Budget 
<br/>allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the question that has been 
<br/>delivered  by  the  honourable  Filipe  Tuisawau.  By  way  of  background,  the  Government  Rural 
<br/>Electrification Programme has been delivered by two implementing agencies.  The first is Energy 
<br/>Fiji Limited which is responsible for the construction and distribution of powerlines and the

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Department of Energy which has been managing the house wiring. As has been expressed earlier this 
<br/>week by the honourable Minister for Economy that for the 2021 Budget that approach has changed 
<br/>and now both  the house-wiring and the powerline construction are to  be  handled by  EFL  for the 
<br/>current Budget going forth into the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of coverage about 80 percent of Fijians are connected to EFL Grid 
<br/>Extension Programmes in the four islands in which EFL operates. These are Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, 
<br/>Taveuni  and  Ovalau.  The  rest  of  Fiji  and  their  connection  to  power  has  been  through  rural 
<br/>government stations in some parts of Fiji through solar-home systems, solar hybrid systems (where 
<br/>you have a small solo farms) and also a diesel generator that you may use when there is not enough 
<br/>sunshine to power the batteries which then provides power to that area. As I had mentioned yesterday, 
<br/>places like Tukavesi have systems like that and also the diesel systems that we have in a lot of our 
<br/>villages which we are hoping to phase out over time as part of our approach to 100 percent renewable 
<br/>energy for the whole of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Grid Extension Programme which EFL has been managing since 2014, Government 
<br/>has commissioned around 491 Rural Electrification Schemes, benefiting around 12,648 households, 
<br/>with a total value of $85.1 million.  This consists of around 123 schemes in the Central Division, 
<br/></span><span>with a total cost of $16.8 million, 250 schemes in the Western Division amounting to $41.6 million 
<br/></span><span>and 118 schemes in the Northern Division with a total value of $26.6 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of March 2022, there are 32 pending schemes.  From the 2017- 2018 and 
<br/>2018-2019 financial year of a total of $18.85 million which are under construction and are expected 
<br/>to be completed by mid-2023. Once completed, 2,754 households, approximately 10,000 Fijians will 
<br/>benefit from the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude Government is  also funding the house wiring component to 
<br/>connect  all the houses to the grid and on to the 2,754 households, 1,258 house wirings are under 
<br/>construction and the rest, 1,496 house wiring materials are under the procurement process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a case with Namarai, Ra where the power 
<br/>lines are in place and live but it has been one year and they are not connected to their homes. Can the 
<br/>honourable Minister explain why you have cases such as this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  In  Namarai,  Ra,  the  grid  extension  has  been  up,  the  house  wiring, 
<br/>sometimes there are difficulties with making sure that these things happen at the same time.  So the 
<br/></span><span>house wiring has to be done, it has to be commissioned and I know now that Namarai, Ra, and going 
<br/></span><span>all the way up to Naocobau.  The grids are there but now we are in the process of connecting all the 
<br/>houses. I think we have done from Silana (not sure whether it is Silana or Nasinu) and all the way to 
<br/>Naocobau.  As I speak today, I was there I think two weeks ago with the company that has been 
<br/>appointed to make sure that people get connected onto the grid, including the Government station 
<br/>that we have in Namarai, Ra.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of rural electrification in general, the 
<br/>allocation of budget, it is quite alarming to note that allocation generally in Government has been 
<br/>underspent hovering around $500 million annually which is almost a quarter of annual expenditure. 
<br/>The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Meteorological  Services  on  average  under  which  rural 
<br/>electrification comes under underutilises around $48 million annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1113 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- So this underutilisation is also in the rural and maritime ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is being done to address this underutilisation of funds in the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Minister for Economy had 
<br/>read  out  how  the  budget  has  been  utilised.  Sometimes  we  have  budget  certain  amounts  and  we 
<br/>commission more projects, other times we commission certain amount and sometimes when we have 
<br/>massive things like </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, sometimes funds have to be taken out of projects that were budgeted 
<br/>to address things that we need to address immediately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we had the devastation by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, we had to make sure that we pulled funds out 
<br/>of existing projects because there is an urgent need there and then.  A budget is a plan.  It is built in 
<br/>a context of your understanding of the situation you have at the time in which you build that budget.  
<br/>But you cannot always foresee what is about to happen.  Is there going to be tropic cyclone, is there 
<br/>going to be COVID-19, for instance, in which the construction teams cannot move to the areas where 
<br/>they are supposed to put up the grid lines and do the house wiring.  You cannot do it.  So in those 
<br/>cases the budget is not fully utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A budget is a plan with all intents and purposes to make sure that it is delivered on time and 
<br/></span><span>that  is  what  happens  in  this  situation.  But  one  thing  that  I  can  say,  Government  is  firm  in  its 
<br/></span><span>commitment, a 100 percent access to electricity, the plan is there, we hope to be able to achieve it on 
<br/>time but if situations change, it will change, funds will be moved around to where they are needed, 
<br/>but eventually we will get to that destination of a 100 percent access to power to all households in 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a supplementary question.  
<br/>For  subcontractors  who  are  given  contracts  for  Rural  Electrification  Programmes,  how  does  the 
<br/>Ministry ensure that they follow through with the standards allowed by the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before a contract is awarded, the contractor has to 
<br/>show that it has met all the standards.  For grid construction, obviously, EFL also has its standards.  
<br/>At the same time, when the house wiring is done, our own officers also inspect, but now that will all 
<br/>be done by EFL.  They will check to make sure that the contractors that are awarded these tenders, 
<br/>they meet standards upfront and as the work commences, they will also check to make sure that the 
<br/>standards are met, whether it is for the construction of the power lines or house wiring.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask a supplementary question to the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister.  With regard to villages all around Fiji, and this is especially for Kadavu, those 
<br/></span><span>who  are  using  generators,  we  have  requested  for  solar  power  through  the  Rural  Electrification 
<br/>Programme.  The Government has put a hold on that because they are using generators.  What is your 
<br/>policy or plans for the future?  Are you going to change those generators into solar systems as soon 
<br/>as?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  As 
<br/>I said, we have a number of targets in Government, 100 percent access to energy.  So that means that 
<br/>if you have a diesel generator at the moment, and we want to put solar home systems, we will first 
<br/>put it in a place where there is no electricity, because you already have your diesel power.  First put 
<br/>it in that place that has no electricity.  But, eventually, over time, because we have a target of 100 
<br/>percent renewable energy, we hope to remove all those diesel engines and replace it with something 
<br/>that uses renewable energy.  In some cases it will be a hybrid situation, as we have in the village of 
<br/>Namara, Sanima in Kadavu and also in Tukavesi. Where you have a solar farm and at the same time 
<br/>you have a small generator on the side.  When the sun is not shining, their generator powers up the 
<br/>batteries.  But, eventually over time, we want to continually move towards a 100 percent renewable 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>energy.  In some places in Fiji, we have small Pico hydros.  We have a hydro system that used to be 
<br/>there in Buca, we are hoping to get that redone, and another one on the other side of Vanua Levu 
<br/>towards Natewa.  But, the focus at the moment, move towards 100 percent renewable energy.  If you 
<br/>already have a diesel system, we will try to keep that going, but eventually, it needs to be replaced 
<br/>by something that uses renewable energy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coastal Protection Works 
<br/>(Question No. 90/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  coastal  protection  works  currently  undertaken  and  the  respective 
<br/>locations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>asking me that question.  Sea level rise is a major consequence of climate change.  The global sea 
<br/>level rise is due to a combination of thermal expansion of the oceans and increase in the run off from 
<br/></span><span>the mountains of continental glaciers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  rate  of  global  mean  sea  level  has  slightly  accelerated  during  the  last  century,  and 
<br/>projections predict the sea level will be 0.4 metres to 0.8 metres higher at the end of this century 
<br/>around  the  Pacific  Islands.    Regional  variations  in  sea  level  also  exist  and  are  due  to  large  scale 
<br/>current of climate features.  In addition, the sea level experienced in the Pacific Islands can also be 
<br/>affected by the vertical land movement that can either increase or decrease the effects of rise in the 
<br/>global mean sea level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coastal inundation are caused by a combination of high waves, tides, storm 
<br/>surge and ocean currents while future changes in the number and severity of higher waves and storms 
<br/>are difficult to access. The rise in the global mean sea level will cause an increase in the frequency 
<br/>and severity of inundation in coastal areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji will continue to experience a positive rate of sea level rise.  This sea 
<br/>level rise will cause a significant increase in frequency and severity of coastal flooding in the near 
<br/>future.  Our Government has stated that it will be difficult to protect those villages which are lying 
<br/>below the sea level in the longer run so these villages will eventually have to be moved to a higher 
<br/></span><span>ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the Ministry of Waterways is committed to protecting those areas which we can through 
<br/>establishment of construction of seawalls and we have got allocations under the Coastal Protection 
<br/>Programme to  protect  these communities, villagers and infrastructure by  construction of seawalls 
<br/>around  these  areas.  Under  this  programme  we  have  implemented  both  a  mixture  of  nature-based 
<br/>seawall and also concretes seawalls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our nature-based seawalls which is now internationally renowned and we are also getting a 
<br/>lot of enquiries on the exact model. We have got a paper done and uploaded on our home page on 
<br/>the exact dimensions of the nature of the seawall, very unique, the first of its kind where we have 
<br/>three layers of defence in this nature- based seawall.  The first layer of defence is where we plant 
<br/>mangroves in the front and then we have got boulders stacked up in the second layer of defence and 
<br/>the  fourth  layer  of  defence  is  a  play  wall  on  which  we  plant  vetiver.  So,  a  very  successfully 
<br/>constructed nature-based seawalls around Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1115 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  currently  the  Ministry  is  constructing  nature-based  seawalls  at  Viseisei 
<br/>Village  of  500  metres,  one  of  the  longest  seawalls  that  we  are  constructing,  totally  nature-based 
<br/>seawall - Viseisei Village in Lautoka - 500 metres, Navunievu Village in Bua - 250 metres, Nananu 
<br/>Village in Tailevu - 500 metres and Nabubu Village in Macuata - 200 metres.  So these are the current 
<br/>ones  that  has  been  constructed.  All  of  these  sites,  at  the  moment  there  are  machines  where  we 
<br/>construct these nature-based seawalls at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also constructing a concrete seawall at Bau Island - 624 metres. We have been trying 
<br/>to construct the seawall for the last three years because it requires a lot of mobilisation.  It is an island 
<br/>and a lot of costs are involved.  We were not able to get a particular contractor, but finally we have 
<br/>one.  We have mobilised the machines already and the work is being currently undertaken.  Due to 
<br/>the nature of that area, we cannot undertake a nature-based seawall construction.  There is no material 
<br/>on that island as the island is very small.  So we have to undertake a concrete seawall construction. 
<br/>The largest seawall, 624 metres. So that is on Bau Island which is now under construction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  past  four  years,  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  through  its  Coastal 
<br/>Protection  Programme,  we  have  done  14  Coastal  Protection  which  consists  of  four  nature-based 
<br/>seawalls, one concrete seawall in the Western Division, three nature-based seawalls in the Northern 
<br/></span><span>Division, three concrete seawalls in the Central Division, one revetment wall in the Eastern Division, 
<br/></span><span>one nature-based seawall in the Maritime Islands.  These projects have benefitted approximately 750 
<br/>households living in the coastal community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the completed ones  in  the Northern Division  are Raviravi  Village  - 660 
<br/>metres seawall, Naividamu  Village  - 150 metres seawall, Drekeniwai  (completed last  year)  - 150 
<br/>metres seawall and Lamini Village - 220 metres seawall. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Western Division, Nabukadra (completed)  - 250 metres seawall, Vaidoko Village  – 
<br/>nature-based seawall 140 metres, Verevere Village – nature-based seawall 150 metres, Malomalo 
<br/>Village - 70 metres, Namoli Village - 430 metres, Rukurukulevu – 380 metres of  concrete wall.  In 
<br/>Sigatoka, Dravuni Village – 280 metres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Rukurukulevu,  Dravuni  and  Lamini  villages,  these  are  the  concrete  sea  walls,  but  the 
<br/>others, Raviravi, Nawaidamu, Drekeniwai, Nabukadra, Vaidoko, Verevere, Malomalo and Namoli, 
<br/>all  are  nature-based  sea  walls.    In  Sigatoka,  Dravuni  Village  –  280  metres.    The  Rukurukulevu, 
<br/>Dravuni and Lamini villages, these are the concrete sea walls, but the others, Raviravi, Nawaidamu, 
<br/>Drekeniwai, Nabukadra, Vaidoko, Verevere, Malomalo and Namoli, all are nature-based sea walls.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Eastern-maritime, the Lodoni - 200 metres nature-based seawall, Namuana - 280 metres 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>seawall completed already. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  demand  for  coastal  communities  with  regard  to  the  need  for  coastal 
<br/>protection continues to increase every year.  Currently, it stands at about 103 seawalls that we need 
<br/>to construct other than the ones we are doing which will protect close to 160 villages.  The number 
<br/>is different like 103 seawalls protecting 160 villages because some of the seawalls will be protecting 
<br/>two or three villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These 103 includes 17 requests from the Eastern Division for about 4.8 kilometres of seawall 
<br/>that we need to construct, 43 requests from the Central Division for 8.7 kilometres, 30 requests from 
<br/>the Western Division for 10.6 kilometres of seawall, 12 requests from the Northern Division for 4.8 
<br/>kilometres, making a total length of 29.1 kilometres of seawall that we need to construct.  Some of 
<br/>these could be concrete, but most of it where the materials are available, we can construct a nature-

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>based seawall.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a nature-based seawall is sustainable, durable, cheaper and we are 
<br/>using nature to deal with the problem caused by nature itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say that the Ministry is very proud of the nature-based seawall 
<br/>which has been developed; our own thinking, our own original idea and our own original model. It 
<br/>came up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we returned from Taveuni after opening a 150-metre seawall at a 
<br/>cost of $1.2 million and we sat down and said that we cannot continue this way; 150 metres seawall 
<br/>costing  $1.2  million,  how  would  we  get  the  money?    When  were  we  going  to  complete  the  29 
<br/>kilometres of seawall that we needed to do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that time, we did not have 29 kilometres, at that time it was probably about 15 kilometres 
<br/>or so.   And then we said, “look I think we need to sit down, get to the drawing board and come up 
<br/>with a model which is cheaper Then we sat down, get to the drawing board and come up with a model 
<br/>which is cheaper, durable and deals with also developing an eco-system around that area.”  So, the 
<br/>nature-based  seawall  apart  from  providing  protection  to  the  village,  we  also  established  an  eco-
<br/>system  which  contributes  to  building  resilience,  expanding  the  biodiversity  and  also  provides  a 
<br/>source of food for the communities around there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  20</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  2021,  a  volcanic  eruption  occurred  in  Tonga  which 
<br/></span><span>created havoc.  A group of Government delegates made a tour to the Lau Group and during their visit 
<br/>to Daliconi Village in Vanuabalavu, the people of Daliconi thanked the Government of the day for 
<br/>putting a 240 metres nature-based seawall which saved their livelihood, property and village.  Had it 
<br/>not been for that 240 metres nature-based seawall, there would have been havoc in the village with 
<br/>that major tidal surge arising out of the earthquake in Tonga. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the climate change is a problem, is a reality and small island states with a 
<br/>lot of coastal communities like Fiji and the Pacific are in the forefront of this challenge posed by 
<br/>climate change and we are in terms of thinking, we are way ahead.  At the moment we are also putting 
<br/>resources, we are also talking to donors, development partners, ADB has approved the construction 
<br/>of 12 seawalls with a lot of paperwork and we want to thank them for that.  So, there are other donors 
<br/>coming  on  board  and  we  are  working  with  them  and  ensuring  that  we  get  them  the  required 
<br/>documentations they need.  Quite meticulous work needs to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are excited that we will be able to deliver this 29 kilometres of seawall.  
<br/>I do not want to give a timeline now but I can give a timeline maybe in six or seven months’ time, 
<br/>when we are clearer in terms of the funding that we are doing to get from our development partners 
<br/></span><span>and of course our own funding as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Seven months’ time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his reply to 
<br/>that question.  The coastal areas around Vatuwaqa are now very heavily populated, some like Nanuku 
<br/>sitting on a bay is in need of seawalls.  Is there any plan to build and protect that Nanuku area? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think you have already covered that, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I did not hear it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- You should concentrate.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got a long list here which adds up to 29 
<br/>kilometres.  We are happy to examine Nanuku.  The Nanuku I mentioned is not this Nanuku, but I 
<br/>mentioned Nananu.  That is past the jetty at Natovi.  So, we are happy to examine that and see, and 
<br/>get it on the list.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that we need to get it on the list.  We want to know the total 
<br/>kilometres that we need to construct because we are going to donors, the development partners, so 
<br/>we need an exhaustive list.  So, if there are other places, we need to get it on the list, Sir.

<div><span>Production and Export of Primary Agricultural Products 
<br/>(Question No. 91/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  programmes  to  increase  the  production  and  export  of 
<br/>primary products, such as </span><span>yaqona, dalo</span><span>, ginger, </span><span>tavioka </span><span>and so forth? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank honourable Radrodro for asking 
<br/></span><span>that question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture, in its 2019-2023 Strategic Development 
<br/>Plan  envisions  a  competitive,  sustainable  and  resilient  agriculture  sector.  The  priorities  are 
<br/>particularly food and nutritional security for all Fijians and also, expanding commercial agriculture 
<br/>and promoting exports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s top non-sugar agricultural exports are led by kava.  The 2021 data 
<br/>shows  that  kava  exports  were  $41.9  million,  followed  by  </span><span>dalo  </span><span>-  $30.1  million  and  interestingly 
<br/>followed  by  number  three,  which  is  turmeric  -  $22.9  million  exports  only,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but 
<br/>mostly to USA.  Then ginger - $13.9 million, then assorted vegetables - $5.7 million, cassava - $1.7 
<br/>million, chicken meat and eggs - $4.7 million.  Those are the top seven, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, for our working knowledge, kava - $41.9 million, next is </span><span>dalo</span><span> - $30.1 million, 
<br/>next  is  turmeric  -  $22.9  million,  then  ginger  -  $13.9  million,  vegetables  -  $5.7  million,  eggs  and 
<br/>chicken products - $4.7 million and cassava - $1.7 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, kava makes an extremely important contribution to our rural exports.  The 
<br/>leading  export  earner,  non-sugar  crop  and,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  see  that  kava  export  in  terms  of 
<br/></span><span>volume and value will increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  external  shocks,  like  cyclones,  have  affected  all  of  these 
<br/>agricultural crops, particularly kava, after </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>and then that is why prices surged about three 
<br/>times  due  to  a  shortage  in  supply.    But  we  are  anticipating  that  the  external  shocks,  particularly 
<br/>cyclone will continue to be there and that is how we are planning and that is why we are putting a lot 
<br/>of infrastructure on the ground, to ensure that it does not  affect that severely, the export of those 
<br/>commodities.  So, today farmers and exporters are bearing the fruit of the market access that we have 
<br/>developed over the years for these particular crops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total kava production in 2021 was 13.79 tonnes with an average annual growth rate of 12.8 
<br/>percent.  That is a substantial two-digit growth rate, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Agriculture received a total 
<br/>budget of $300,000 for kava production only, and this goes to farm access roads, provision of </span><span>yaqona</span><span>
<br/>cuttings, construction of farm houses, training of farmers, nurseries, technical support and physical 
<br/>testing. Before it was only the University of the South Pacific’s laboratory but now, we have got our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>laboratory at Koronivia where exporters can bring in their kava and get it tested in the fraction of the 
<br/>price that USP charges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have distributed 100,000 kava cuttings in Lomaiviti, Northern Division, 
<br/>Western Division, constructed farms in Ovalau, Moturiki, Levuka and Lau;, established nurseries in 
<br/>Ovalau and Vanuabalavu.  We have plans to establish more nurseries in the Western Division so that 
<br/>instead of giving cuttings to farmers, we can give seedlings because germination rate is 100 percent.  
<br/>With cuttings, germination rates are much lower. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  regards  to  </span><span>dalo</span><span>,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $400,000  was  provided  to  promote  </span><span>dalo</span><span>  and  this 
<br/>includes 63,500 </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers distributed to 55 farms in Bua and 14 plantations in Koro Island.  This 
<br/>was after </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>and</span><span> TC Ana</span><span>.  In addition to this</span><span>, </span><span>452,000 </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers were distributed outside 
<br/>this area.  The annual average </span><span>dalo</span><span> production was 54,700 tonnes.  The annual average growth rate 
<br/>of </span><span>dalo</span><span> production was 7.5 percent for the last five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ginger, with the improved production and targeting export, we are putting a lot of resources 
<br/>on ginger, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There was $3 million worth of material support to ginger.  Ginger is a 
<br/>different crop, we need to open up new land every year.  If you plant ginger in one plot, for the next 
<br/></span><span>three  years  you  cannot  plant  ginger  in  the  same  plot  because  of  nematode.    It  means  every  year, 
<br/></span><span>farmers need to shift their production to new plots and after three years, they can only return, so you 
<br/>have to put in  a lot of money in terms of land preparation and excavator usage and also planting 
<br/>material supply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we assisted 333 new farmers with more than 87 metric tonnes of ginger 
<br/>valued at $217,000.  Yesterday, when honourable Members were talking about poverty reduction, 
<br/>the sustainable way of reducing poverty which they were arguing in the rural and maritime areas is 
<br/>to assist those farmers to utilise the resources that are with them for a sustainable solution to poverty 
<br/>alleviation.  This is exactly what we are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad was saying that we are reading out the Budget.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, what is the Budget about? It is about growing the economy, assisting the farmers and resource 
<br/>owners utilise their resources and earn a sustainable living and, therefore, deal with poverty rather 
<br/>than just giving them a handout. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the turmeric commodity is a competitive advantages.  Our turmeric has a 
<br/>particular cumin component which is much, much higher than turmeric from other countries and it 
<br/></span><span>is for this reason, turmeric is high in demand in the United States.  Turmeric in not only used for food 
<br/></span><span>purposes but also a medicinal product.  Our turmeric now is sought after in the United States, We 
<br/>expend  $100,000  in  this  year’s  budget  on  promoting  turmeric  expansion  and  we  have  seen  that 
<br/>turmeric grew - 33.3 percent last year, compared to the previous year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you talk about export, you also need to support exporters so that they can collect their 
<br/>produce, lift it and export it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  For the last five years, we have spent $29 million with 
<br/>Agro Marketing Authority (AMA) so that they can collect produce from those areas where exporters 
<br/>are not able to reach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the honourable Members were saying that AMA is only collecting 
<br/>for that particular quota.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot have farmers who wakes up one morning 
<br/>and says, “I need$20”, so they will pick half bag of cassava, come to the AMA outlet, sell that cassava 
<br/>and take the $20.  We cannot treat AMA like a bank.  So, what we are saying is, if you sign up a 
<br/>contract with us, then we know what volume you need to secure our market.  Without that, we cannot, 
<br/>we have contracts with buyers from Australia and New Zealand and we need to ensure that we have 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1119 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that volume.  So, in the absence of a contract with the farmer, we are a bit conservative in terms of 
<br/>what we will be able to procure and, therefore, sign up contracts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done now from about six months ago, we have said; “Alright, 
<br/>we will not turn you back.  Anyone coming to Savusavu or Bua, we will not turn you back, but this 
<br/>is the quota, this is the premium price.  Then after that quota, the price drops.  That is the two-tier 
<br/>price, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, no one coming to Savusavu Office or Bua AMA Office will be turned 
<br/>back.  But if the Bua quota is exhausted, then the second price will kick in, which we can buy and 
<br/>sell it at a lower price. This business concept is something they do not understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, they were talking about the welfare of the farmers. We are now 
<br/>going all out in our meetings with FNPF and FDB to make farmers voluntary members of FNPF.  In 
<br/>every meeting, we have an FNPF Officer with the desk there and we announced two days before for 
<br/>them to come with their ID card and $10 to them members of FNPF. A lot of the AMA farmers are 
<br/>now members of FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   We also want our farmers to receive pension after 55 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2012, the Ministry had assisted 25 agro exporters.  As I have said, we 
<br/></span><span>need to support exporters so that they are ready to pick up the produce and send it. We have supported 
<br/></span><span>25 agro exporters with 13 cold storage facilities, nine packing houses, two collection centres, three 
<br/>storage sheds, two freezer trucks and two food processing machines at a cost of $3.3 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to support exporters because they have done an excellent 
<br/>job  over  the  last  two  years  during  the  most  difficult  situation  with  freight  rates  going  up  during 
<br/>COVID-19, but they continued to pick up their produce, lift their containers, both through air freight 
<br/>as well as sea freight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  said  that,  our  exports  have  gone  up  substantially.    In  2020,  for  the  first  time,  we 
<br/>exceeded $106 million, in 2021 it went to $121 million. In nominal terms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, 
<br/>the value of non-sugar agriculture was $1.2 billion.  My belief is that, today in 2022, it is about $1.5 
<br/>billion.  In nine years’ time, we want to get it to $2 billion in the agriculture sector and export to $0.5 
<br/>billion from the $121 million that was there last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  where  we  are.  Numbers  have  picked  up  and  I  hope  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members from the other side use these numbers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe  the  honourable  Minister  is 
<br/></span><span>meandering  in answering his question. So maybe the next time, he should be succinct and give the 
<br/>answer as required in the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the explanation that is given, most of the farmers are saying they are 
<br/>finding it hard to maintain large commercial farming because of the decisions that have been taken 
<br/>by the Ministry, especially in terms of  weedicides.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Ask your supplementary question?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  is  something  to  do  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decision of the Ministry with regards  to paraquat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED- KHAIYUM.- Your question.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Give me a second, honourable Attorney General, I will ask the 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister which is regarding paraquat. As we know, paraquat has been 
<br/>used by neighbouring islands, Tonga and Samoa to increase their production, especially </span><span>dalo</span><span>. The 
<br/>question is, can the honourable Minister review the decision to bring back paraquat to be used by 
<br/>farmers in Fiji, especially those in Vanua Levu, Namosi, Naitasiri who plant </span><span>dalo</span><span> and ginger?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a longwinded supplementary question. I now give the floor to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister and I hope you are brief on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.-  No, paraquat is never going to come back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member said to bring back paraquat to increase production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Paraquat does not increase production.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a major … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.-  You are an educated man, you could explain it to the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, paraquat has a major health risk.  The FSC banned paraquat long time back 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because they found residues of in the sugar that was manufactured, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  farmers  in  USA  are  saying  that  we  should  ban  paraquat  because  of 
<br/>possible  cause  of  Alzheimer’s.  There  is  a  lot  of  health  effect.    Paraquat  has  also  been  found  in 
<br/>vegetables that people are consuming.  There are a lot of journal articles published which demonstrate 
<br/>the link of paraquat to cancer.  I just asked him to </span><span>Google</span><span> and see the effect of paraquat on health, 
<br/>cancer in particular. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  answer his  question about  substitute, he did  not  ask that question, he 
<br/>should have asked, what is  the substitute to  paraquat?  There is  a substitute to  paraquat  which is 
<br/>glucoside.  Farmers are being told and there are cooperative farmers which are completely organic, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. Completely organic is not reading newspapers, there is a big feature article in his 
<br/>favourite paper which shows that they are completely organic without paraquat.

<div><span>Renewal &amp; Replacement Programme - Old Crossings and Bridges  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>           (Question No. 92/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 
<br/>Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  the  progress  of  the  renewal  and  replacement 
<br/>programme for old crossings and bridges? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the question asked by honourable 
<br/>Rohit  Sharma  and  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his  question.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  road 
<br/>infrastructure  network  under  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  consists  of  around  6,400  kilometres  of  the 
<br/>slightly more than 11,000 kilometres of roads that we have in this country.  It includes 1,390 bridges 
<br/>and crossings.  These bridges and crossings form part of the road network and they are very important 
<br/>to the network itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1121 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  years  some  of  the  factors  that  have  affected  our  bridges  and 
<br/>crossings are aging infrastructure, a lot of them are quite old, the impact of natural disasters such as 
<br/>floods, landslides and also the overloading, when a lot of these crossings and bridges were built, they 
<br/>did not have the kind of heavy vehicles that we have now on the roads that are using in our roads in 
<br/>Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the significant increase in the number of heavy trucks on the Fiji network has 
<br/>caused  accelerated  deterioration  of  the  infrastructure  that  it  has,  and  we  have  had  to  impose 
<br/>restrictions in the number of bridges, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  this  regard,  the  renewal  and  replacement  programme  for  bridges  and 
<br/>crossings is very important.  Replacing bridges and crossings on time is critical as if we delay any 
<br/>such exercise it can mean more maintenance costs over time and also poses a risk to those who use 
<br/>those at risk infrastructure.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the selection of these bridges and jetties is determined on the inspection 
<br/>carried out through our National Road Infrastructure Network.  The FRA inspects them, identifies 
<br/>the ones that are most at risk, that are heavily used and then it categorises the ones that need to be 
<br/>fixed immediately, those that can be done progressively over time and those for which you do not 
<br/>have to replace it or you can just do a little remedial work so that it can still be used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  has  committed  unprecedented  funding  allocations  at  recent 
<br/>years  and  has  vastly  expanded  and  upgraded  the  country’s  entire  land  transportation  network  to 
<br/>provide new levels of access and far greater mobility for our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past few years, the funding for this has been consistently between 
<br/>$30 million to $50 million that has been allocated for the upgrade and replacement of existing critical 
<br/>bridges and crossings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the renewal and replacement for bridges and jetties will be pursued on a 
<br/>bigger scale.  In doing so, the replacement for 40 new critical bridges is currently being undertaken 
<br/>in phases with the design phase and then eventually, we will be looking to see how we can fund all 
<br/>those critical new bridges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent programme of improvements of the road infrastructure network 
<br/>achievement, we have had 76 new bridges and crossing renewals and replacements completed across 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the renewal 
<br/></span><span>and repairs of those bridges, because those bridges will also serve agricultural areas in Fiji and ensure 
<br/>production comes up.  I  would like to say that when we come into Government, we are going to 
<br/>increase all those figures that honourable Reddy has mentioned; lot of exports and less on imports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Ask your supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- The question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are you also going to renew and 
<br/>repair the Nabilodra Bridge and Bua Bridge?  The Bua Bridge is not for traffic, but for person traffic 
<br/>one, so can it be included also in the programme, the renewal and replacement of those bridges? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not fully get the question, it was such a long 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- There was no question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Be precise about your question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Yes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    It  is  the  Nabilodra  Bridge  near 
<br/>Namuavoivoi to the Wainunu side and the Bua Bridge, are they included in the programme as well?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  said,  what  the  FRA  does,  it  inspects  all  the 
<br/>bridges and crossings.  At the moment there are 100 critical bridges and crossings; you cannot fix 
<br/>them all at the same time.  There are some crossings, all you need to do is make the approaches better 
<br/>because sometimes when you have crossings, the crossing stay but the approach goes.  The approach 
<br/>means the end towards the side.   So in those cases, what you do, the crossing can remain serviceable, 
<br/>you try to improve the crossing,  you make the cement portion a bit longer so that it does not  get 
<br/>washed away, you do the riprap to make sure the water does not take that away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are others which really need to be fixed immediately, those ones will be immediately 
<br/>put on the critical list.  The Namuavoivoi Road is a very important one because it shortens the access 
<br/>of people from Wainunu going across to Labasa.  At the moment, some of those places still have 
<br/></span><span>splash crossings, which means the vehicle goes across the river and up on the other side.  Eventually 
<br/></span><span>overtime, as it moves up the priority listing then all of these will eventually be addressed.  There is a 
<br/>large list, it has to be done progressively over time, but it is our focus to make sure that that road 
<br/>network is improved overtime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  is  on  Raiwaqa  Bridge  along 
<br/>Kavanagasau Road that links the farmers to the market.  What is FRA planning to with the Raiwaqa 
<br/>Bridge? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the exact thing that is done to any specific bridge, I 
<br/>do not always have that information on hand.  But I will get that information and pass it along to the 
<br/>honourable Member.

<div><span>“Say No to Illegal Logging” Initiative 
<br/>(Question No. 93/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Sugar 
<br/></span><span>Industry, Foreign Affairs and Forestry update Parliament on the status of the “Say No to 
<br/>Illegal Logging” initiative recently launched by the Ministry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am answering this question on behalf of 
<br/>the  honourable  Prime  Minister  who  has  got  an  engagement  in  Serua.    Illegal  logging  is  a  major 
<br/>problem  across  the  world  and  in  all  types  of  forests.    It  has  serious  negative  impacts  on  the 
<br/>environment  and  forest  ecosystems,  communities  and  indeed  economies.    It  undermines  the 
<br/>legitimacy of the forest sector and hinders efforts to implement sustainable forest management.  It 
<br/>also  depresses  the  market  value  of  timber.  It  also  depresses  the  market  value  of  timber  while 
<br/>disadvantaging those companies that engage in legal and sustainable logging and trade. There is a 
<br/>huge disadvantage to the majority of the landowning communities as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United Nations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, estimates that illegal logging costs to global community up 
<br/>to $US206 billion each year.  This makes it one of the largest environmental crimes by economic 
<br/>value in the world today.  Fiji, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not immune to illegal logging and the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trade of illegally log timber. In Vanua Levu alone, for example, Sir, a total of 29 cases were recorded 
<br/>from January 2017 to January 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The most common illegal logging practices in Fiji include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Harvesting, transportation and purchase or sale of timber in contravention of violation the 
<br/>national laws such as the Forest Act, Environment Management Act and the iTaukei Land 
<br/>Trust Act among others; 
<br/>Extraction of CITES listed species deliberately encroaching into forest adjacent to licence 
<br/>logging areas.  Logging in protected areas such as forest reserves, logging in prohibited 
<br/>areas such as  steep slopes, river banks and catchment areas including buffers and removing 
<br/>undersized trees; 
<br/>Falsifying declarations of volume or species harvested as well as export documentations.  
<br/>Transporting logs without truck passes or outdated truck passes.  Ignoring waste disposal 
<br/>and an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) screening processes and operating sawmills 
<br/>without valid licences; and

<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Dishonest practices resulting in only a few benefitting from the forestry deals at the expense 
<br/>of  the  majority  in  landowning  units  and  we  saw  that.    Quite  significantly,  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Bulanauca will know about this.  A lot of illegal logging took place the days before the 
<br/></span><span>mahogany industry was actually regulated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to curb illegal logging and to help enforce our national laws and regulations, 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Forestry  formulised  partnerships  through  Memorandums  of  Understanding,  with 
<br/>agencies  like  the  Fiji  Revenue  Custom  Service  (FRCS),  Fiji  Bureau  of  Statistics,  Fiji  National 
<br/>Provident Fund, Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations and the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  working  very  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment  to  ensure  that  licences  for 
<br/>logging, sawmilling and treatment plants are issued only after an assessment has been conducted and 
<br/>the environmental impacts and the Ministry of Environment has approved either the Environmental 
<br/>Management Plan with a more detail Environment Impact Assessment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  also  strengthening  its  relationship  with  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board 
<br/>especially to clearly identify not only the genuine landowners but also to make sure that majority of 
<br/>them (at least 60 percent of them) have agreed to the harvesting of trees from their respective lands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  latest  development  from  iTLTB  is  the  sharing  of  access  to  the  online  Harvesting 
<br/></span><span>Licencing  System  which,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  had  the  privilege  of 
<br/>launching three weeks ago. This will help expedite our business facilitation processes also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these partnerships aim to form a formidable front to cut down illegal 
<br/>forest activities, ensure that forest-based companies provide appropriate safety working conditions 
<br/>for their staff, pay their staff the correct wages and FNPF and also pay the correct amount of taxes.  
<br/>Importantly,  Sir,  it  aims  to  strengthen  our  efforts  to  protect  the  environment  as  a  way  to  address 
<br/>climate change, as any environment through damage caused by hastily and poorly planned operations 
<br/>can be irreparable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The partnerships will also help to ensure that fair compensation is provided to the resource 
<br/>owners  through  correct  and  timely  royalty  and  stumpage  payments  and  where  appropriate  lease 
<br/>payments. Additionally the partnerships will ensure that the total contribution of forestry sector is 
<br/>accurately measured and reflected in the country’s GDP.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  launched  the  “Say  to  No  Illegal  Logging  Pledge”  in 
<br/>Labasa on the 11</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022.  Their aim is to create greater public awareness and to gather 
<br/>support from as many stakeholders as possible to curb illegal logging.  Close to 300 individuals, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, have signed up to the pledge since its launch.  These include farmers, landowning units, 
<br/>licenced loggers, Government officials, of course, and private companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 68 percent of the pledges actually come from the landowning units and we 
<br/>expect  the  momentum  to  increase  as  we  continue  to  conduct  awareness  through  the  </span><span>tikina</span><span>  and 
<br/>provincial meetings where one of which our honourable Prime Minister is attending today through 
<br/>our ongoing discussion with the members of the timber industry through increasing media awareness 
<br/>and also right here, of course, in Parliament, Sir.  The pledge is been piloted in Vanua Levu before it 
<br/>is implemented in Viti Levu and other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also in discussion with the Fiji Independent Commission 
<br/>Against  Corruption  (FICAC)  where  a  number  of  illegal  logging  cases  have  been  filed,  it  also 
<br/>strengthened partnership including running the say to “No Illegal Logging” pledge in parallel with 
<br/>FICAC’s “I do Not Accept Bribes” campaign.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is building the capacity of its staff, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we wish to thank both 
<br/></span><span>FICAC  and  the  DPP  for  the  training  opportunities  they  have  provided  and  are  providing  to  the 
<br/>Ministry of Forestry staff when investigation and prosecution processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like all Members to actually support this to “Say No to Illegal 
<br/>Logging” pledge because it is critically important for us because I am sure that we all would agree 
<br/>that we need to protect our forests.  If the forest is going to be harvested, we need to be sure it is done 
<br/>in a sustainable manner.  We need to also protect indigenous species.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Forestry, of course, started a nursery on the indigenous species and also, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we also need to look at forestry in a very different manner which is that currently, our 
<br/>way of valuing forestry is only when it is cut down and that contributes to GDP.  But as highlighted 
<br/>in the Climate Change Act, we can actually have GDP contribution by the forestry sector by keeping 
<br/>the trees on the ground through carbon trading.

<div><span>Rehabilitation Works at Lekutu Schools 
<br/>(Question No. 94/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government update Parliament on the rehabilitation works at Lekutu District School and 
<br/>Lekutu Secondary School? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  respond  to  the  question  on  Lekutu  District  School  and  Lekutu 
<br/>Secondary  School,  I  would  like  to  refer  to  honourable  Salote  Radrodro’s  </span><span>Facebook</span><span>  post  of  10</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>January, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Salote Radrodro claimed that she visited both schools on Saturday, 8</span><span>th</span><span> January, 
<br/>2020, prior to school re-opening to check the progress on the rebuilding works on Lekutu District 
<br/>School and Lekutu Secondary School.  These two schools were damaged by </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> and </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> in 
<br/>December 2019 and January 2020.  She claimed that school rebuilding was at a snail’s pace which

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meant,  both  schools  will  operate  with  much  less  classroom  space  whereby  the  social  distancing 
<br/>problem becomes a much a bigger problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Let me speak you will have a chance to ask questions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an utter nonsense.  Let me inform this august House that the situation 
<br/>in the schools that honourable Salote Radrodro visited, as claimed in her </span><span>Facebook</span><span> post, is not true 
<br/>at all.  The Ministry’s response to the damages caused to these two schools… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, we are not referring to the </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, I am answering the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  two  schools,  after  the  tropical  cyclone  were  very  quick  and  students  were 
<br/></span><span>accommodated  appropriately.    Initially,  students  were  in  tents  of  good  standard,  while  pre-fab 
<br/></span><span>buildings were built.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Lekutu District School sustained minor damages during </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and after 
<br/>swift repair works, the school was ready.  However, the student hostel was damaged and students 
<br/>initially used tents.  The hostel is part of the defect reconstruction project.  Now, a single tent is used 
<br/>as a dining facility for the primary school students.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  Lekutu  Secondary  School,  a  1  x  7  classroom  block  was  damaged  during  the  cyclone.  
<br/>While the pre-fab building was being constructed, students were accommodated in well-constructed 
<br/>tents, while school closed on 20</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2021. A 1 x 7 pre-fab block was built by the Government at 
<br/>a cost of $380,000 and the construction work was completed in August 2021, and this building can 
<br/>withstand Category 3 cyclone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this claim was made by the honourable Member in January 2022, the 
<br/>standard temporary classrooms were already built and it was ready for the students to resume classes.  
<br/>So, the temporary structures or what we call the pre-fab buildings, were already built when she visited 
<br/>the place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alternative arrangement was already made, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is rather sad to note how the 
<br/>Opposition Members told half-truth through the </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page.  This was the time when the country 
<br/>was dealing with the crisis and every effort was being made by the Ministry to get the students back 
<br/>into the classroom, but  the Opposition  Members  were hell-bent  in  discouraging  students  to  go to 
<br/>school.  It is related to the school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  six-classroom    building  is  currently  under  construction  by  the 
<br/>Australian Defence Force (ADF) with floor and walls already built as part of phase one.  A team of 
<br/>eight ADF engineering personnel arrived on 5</span><span>th</span><span> April, and will be followed by the main team that 
<br/>will be here on 21</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  main  construction  team  comprises  of  21  RFMF  personnel,  25  ADF 
<br/>personnel, six personnel from the French Armed Forces of New Caledonia and four personnel from 
<br/>the New Zealand Defence Force.  Construction will recommence on 25</span><span>th</span><span> April, and it will finished 
<br/>by the end of July 2022.  So, while this building is being made, there is another set of building already

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>built for the students to  resume their classes.    In addition to the classroom block that the ADF is 
<br/>constructing under the DFAT project, additional work at Lekutu will include; dormitories for girls 
<br/>and boys, one ablution block, a dining hall for Lekutu District School, five teachers’ quarters, covered 
<br/>walkways to  link school  buildings and building services for solar power, water supply and waste 
<br/>management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on overcrowding, let me highlight the fact that Lekutu District School has 
<br/>154 students from Year 1 Year 8.  The lowest number of students in a class is 12 and the highest is 
<br/>29.  The issue of social distancing in Lekutu District School is a non-issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  secondary  school  has  seven  classrooms  in  the  newly-built  prefab 
<br/>building which has a sitting capacity of 45 students per class.  Overall, it can cater for 315 students, 
<br/>while the current school roll stands at 219, so honestly I am not sure what her concern was all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such kind of misinformation actually discourages parents from sending their 
<br/>children to school and during that time, she also advised the students’ parents to engage the children 
<br/>for two hours of learning each day and teach them life skills, such as washing, sewing and gardening.  
<br/>Clearly two hours of school work was not enough to compensate the learning loss of almost eight 
<br/></span><span>months.  We wish to ask the honourable Member, why was she sabotaging the work of the Ministry?  
<br/></span><span>What  authority  did  she  have to  advise parents  against the advice  given  by the Ministry based on 
<br/>science  and  sound  advice  from  United  Nations  Children’s  Fund  (UNICEF),  World  Health 
<br/>Organisation (WHO) and Ministry of Health?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what was happening behind the scene.  While the Ministry was busy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trying to prepare schools … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, just stick to answering that question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are going all over the place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am pleased to say that while DFAT and ADF continue construction 
<br/>work at Lekutu District School and Lekutu Secondary School, there is ample space for students to 
<br/>study in comfort.  I have personally visited the two schools and had discussions with the head of 
<br/>school, teachers, management committee and parents, and I provided them firsthand update on the 
<br/></span><span>project and the work schedule.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  not  fix  the  schools  using  glue.    We  build  Category  5  standard 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>classrooms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Shame on you!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am not ashamed.

<div><span>Land Buy Back Scheme 
<br/>(Question No. 95/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands 
<br/>and Mineral  Resources  update Parliament on the current  status  of the  Land Buy  Back 
<br/>Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vosanibola for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources through  its  Land Use Division, or what we 
<br/>commonly refer to as the Land Bank, has always emphasised the right to equal access to land for all, 
<br/>including members of our indigenous </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and those desiring to secure affordable parcels of land 
<br/>for their livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the past three years, we have committed to taking all the necessary steps in providing fair, 
<br/>transparent,  effective  and  non-discriminatory  administration  of  all  Freehold  Buy  Back  land 
<br/>purchased under the Freehold Buy Back Scheme.  To date, the Land Use Division, through the Land 
<br/>Bank, has successfully implemented joint venture initiatives and resource owner-friendly concepts 
<br/>to fasttrack and assist landowning units, as stated in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So far, out of the 24 Freehold  Buy Back land, the following seven landowning units have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fully paid their dues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Yavusa Waivunia of Cakaudrove; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Yavusa Waidau of Ovalau; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali Nailagobakola of Nausori; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Yavusa Nasuva of Taveuni; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Waidra and Nabu of Yavusa Vugalei in Tailevu; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali Naobisi, Luvunivuaka, Tailevu; and 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali Nasavunivonu, Drekeniwai, Cakaudrove. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A balance of 17 landowning units are still in the repayment process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2021-2022 financial year alone, despite the impacts of the pandemic, two landowning 
<br/>units successfully paid off their dues; namely Mataqali Naomisi of Luvunivuaka Village in Tailevu 
<br/>and Mataqali Nasavunivonu</span><span> </span><span>of Drekeniwai, Cakaudrove.  Further, in the 2019-2020 financial year, 
<br/>Waidra  and  Nabu  of  Yavusa  Vugalei</span><span> </span><span>in  Tailevu  settled  their  dues.    Their  total  repayment  was 
<br/>$380,000, being $92,000 for the Mataqali Naomisi;</span><span> </span><span>$140,000 for the Mataqali Nasavunivonu</span><span>; </span><span>and 
<br/>$148,000 for the Yavusa Vugalei</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is significant to note that there has been a reversion of around 168.6187 acres of Freehold 
<br/>land to native resource owners between the years 2019 to 2021. We have successfully collated and 
<br/>recovered $2.318 million out of the $4.575 billion that was supposed to be collected from the Land 
<br/>Owning Units (LOUs).  This is around 50.68 percent.  There are three out of the four land parcels of 
<br/>the LOUs who had fully paid their dues have been transferred namely; Yavusa Nasuva</span><span> </span><span> of Taveuni, 
<br/>Cakaudrove; Yavusa Waivunia</span><span> </span><span>of Savusavu, Cakaudrove; and Yavusa Waidau</span><span> </span><span>of Ovalau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, we know there are some landowning units who 
<br/>defaulted  in  their  payments.    They  had  encountered  some  challenges  in  meeting  up  with  their 
<br/>contractual  payment  agreements,  or  they  encountered  repayment  constraints.    So,  assistance  was 
<br/>rendered from the Land Bank by leasing of the Freehold Buy Back to meet the landowners’ payment 
<br/>obligation.  To date, nine Freehold Buy Back land has been leased to assist those LOUs who defaulted 
<br/>in their payments.  So they default on their payments, the land is leased and money is collected to 
<br/>pay back what they owe, then that land is given back to the lenders because they could not pay it off 
<br/>themselves.  That is the exercise.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the buyback  land occupied by informal settlements  and Naviria in  Savusavu, ongoing 
<br/>consultation has been executed with the tailor-made solutions communicated to all parties involved 
<br/>for a win situation for all.  With this concept will see the regularisation of the 63 informal settlements 
<br/>occupying the buyback land where they will pay the premium of their lease whilst the money collated 
<br/>would be used to clear all the land owning units arrears with a surplus paid directly to their accounts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In essence as mediators and land administrators, we have to ensure the right balance is struck 
<br/>so that economic growth is stimulated through the collection of revenue from landowning units and 
<br/>appropriate utilisation of our resources it optimised. Consequently, the land use division has to ensure 
<br/>that all parties affected are assisted and their interest are realized and protected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU. J.A.R. SENILOLI.- As reported by the honourable Minister, four landowning 
<br/>units have paid their debts and three parcels have been transferred. There is one landowning unit 
<br/>which I understand is </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> </span><span>Nailagobokola </span><span>in Nausori which has yet to receive their title despite 
<br/>the fact that they have fully paid their debt. Can the honourable Minister explain why the transfer 
<br/>title has not been transferred?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker,  I am sure that the transfer process is in progress and the 
<br/></span><span>officials are working hand in hand with the landowners to make sure that that is done as speedy as 
<br/></span><span>possible and it will be done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I am just trying to make sure no one is at my back. I note that 
<br/>there is a small budget for the administration of all these buy-back land.  Why is there no budget for 
<br/>new buy-back land?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this programme started in 1989 where there was a 
<br/>commitment of  approximately $4.575 million. From 1989 till now, that is the money that has been 
<br/>tied up and not paid on time. If you look at the value of the money at which it was bought and the 
<br/>amount of money collected now, the value of money declines over time. So there were a lot of assets 
<br/>that were tied up at that time, it has been slow.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we wanted to do now is clear the ones that were already there out of 
<br/>the 24 freehold land buy-back schemes; that was the situation. There was a commitment made, the 
<br/>payments were not done on time and the Ministry of Lands has gone out on its own to help them 
<br/>make  their  payments.  These  group  of  landowners  wanted  this  land,  they  could  not  make  their 
<br/>commitment so what the Ministry of Lands said, “We take this, we lease it out so you do not have to 
<br/></span><span>pay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once that money is collected then meets the amount of money that you owe to Government 
<br/>then when the rest of the money that was collected goes direct to you.  We have gone out of our way 
<br/>to  do  that,  but  there  has  been  capital  been  tied  up,  that  was  a  policy  in  1989,  the  Government  is 
<br/>committed to implementing it.  If the Government decides to do it again in the future, that will be 
<br/>something that will have to be decided in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will move. We do not have the time today. We will finish at 12.30 pm.

<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on how much 
<br/>has been spent on outsourcing of services to private general and dental practitioners and 
<br/>the plans moving forward? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the honourable Member for 
<br/>the question. As has been discussed in Parliament previously that the Private GP Scheme that it is 
<br/>going to be made available to members of the public who normally would not go to a private doctor 
<br/>has been made available during the COVID period in June 2021.  We have seen that is a very good 
<br/>scheme that is now providing a lot of services that hitherto was not provided to those Fijians who 
<br/>could not afford to go and visit GPs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently,  there  are  14  GPs,  and  one  medical  centre  that  has  locations  in  three  different 
<br/>centres strewn across predominantly Suva, Nadi, Ba and one in Lautoka.  Sir, essentially the scheme 
<br/>prior to the new announcement, you could go to a GP for consultation, review, referrals, injections, 
<br/>dressings and other minor dressings and also you could participate in the free medical scheme should  
<br/>they prescribe any medicine for you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had allocated $5 million. So, far we have spent $1.6 million, the cost of 
<br/></span><span>medical  services,  58,425  Fijians  have  actually  used  these  services.  When  the  GP  Scheme, 
<br/></span><span>interestingly, Sir, was rolled out in late June 2021, an average of around 1,400 patients were seen on 
<br/>a weekly basis.  Over the last few months we have seen the numbers have gone up to an average of 
<br/>1,700 patients a week that are seen under this particular scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had also announced in the Budget, Sir, that we will in fact now increase 
<br/>the type of services that will be made available under this particular scheme.  So now, for example, 
<br/>if you go and visit one of these GPs, Sir, you can get a multi-urine dipstick test done, ECG, nebuliser 
<br/>treatment,  oxygen supply  and ultrasound scans if they have it, at  all Government’s cost.   So it is 
<br/>actually a holistic approach to the services that these GPs will provide, Sir, including as announced 
<br/>in the Budget, we also have advertised for private medical laboratories. These  doctors can also ask 
<br/>for blood test for you, so for example, sugar, complete blood count, base metabolic penal or basic 
<br/>electrolyte  panel,  cholesterol  lipid  profile,  glycated  haemoglobin  test,  liver  function  and  renal 
<br/>function.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about NCDs, we need to be able to capture the members of 
<br/>the population at this very early stage. So if they develop a relationship with a private GP who they 
<br/>regularly  see,  that  particular  GP  will  be  able  to  track  their  medical  record,  be  able  to  track  their 
<br/></span><span>medical moving as their age, for example.  If they are able to do this test they can also say to them, 
<br/></span><span>“look, you are 30 years old but your sugar is 6 or 7, cut it back down”.  Normally, what we see when 
<br/>these people who normally cannot afford to go and see GPs, when they get really sick, that is when 
<br/>they are turn up to the public health system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as also announced in the Budget, we want to expand this particular service, 
<br/>we have advertised, we have received 28 Expressions of Interest.  Interestingly in a number of new 
<br/>areas too, Savusavu - 1, Labasa - 1, we did not receive anything from Rakiraki or Tavua, Ba  - 3, 
<br/>Lautoka - 2, Nadi - 3, Sigatoka - 4, Navua - 1, Korovou - 1, Nausori - 1, Lami - 0, Nakasi - 3, Nasinu 
<br/>- 2 and Suva - 6.  This will become fairly wide in respect of the services they will be able to provide, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be announcing those who qualify by next week and, of course, these 
<br/>are available on the Government </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page so members of the public can actually go and visit 
<br/>them also.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the expansion to the dental services, as a result of COVID-19 and 
<br/>because of the lockdowns, because of the infection issue, a lot of the dental services were actually 
<br/>put on hold and we have seen now a huge rush for those services. Again, Sir, we have advertised that 
<br/>these  dental  procedures  which  includes  consultation,  temporary  filling,  permanent  filling  and 
<br/>extraction will be provided through this particular PPP Scheme. We have so far received six EOIs - 
<br/>two from Suva, two from Nakasi, one from Navua and one from Lautoka.  If they qualify, Sir, these 
<br/>dental services will be made available to them.  As we also said, Sir, we have also advertised for the 
<br/>Private Medical Laboratory Scheme where we have already received six Expressions of Interest in 
<br/>that respect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last component of this is that we also want to assist private GPs to go 
<br/>into areas where population numbers are growing and people may need to travel long distances. So 
<br/>some of the areas we have highlighted, for example, if you look at Seaqaqa, Nasorowaqa, Dreketi, et 
<br/>cetera, if you have a private GP in that location, you could have a number of people travelling to 
<br/>them too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also if you look at some of the areas that have now expanded in what we call “semi-urban 
<br/>areas” outside Nadi, like, Korovuto, Malolo, Nawai and all those areas, so if you have private GP 
<br/></span><span>there, in particular, for example, if there is flooding and people cannot get to Nadi Hospital, if you 
<br/></span><span>have a private GP available, they will be able to go and see the private GP.  In that respect, sir, we 
<br/>also allocated $200,000 to actually help them with some additional set up costs because we need 
<br/>these people out there.  Of course, we will be advertising that very soon. 
<br/></span></div>
