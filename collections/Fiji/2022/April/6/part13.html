<div><span> Status of the Nadi Flood Alleviation Project 
<br/>(Question No. 70/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that correction.  My question is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and 
<br/>Communication, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament of the status of 
<br/>the proposed Nadi Flood Alleviation Project which was the subject of the Japan International 
<br/>Co-operation Agency (JICA) Report in 2016? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for that correction.  As has been 
<br/>highlighted previously and I did give a fairly detailed information on the Nadi Rehabilitation Project 
<br/>back in 2020, the Nadi River Rehabilitation Project is a diversion from what was in the 1990s.  When 
<br/>the Leader of PAP was then Prime Minister, they had a Nadi River Diversion Project funded by the 
<br/>Japanese Government where they wanted to realign the Nadi River, not for it to go through town but 
<br/>actually take it out at the back where the Colonial Plaza is and empty it down into the basin in that 
<br/>area. Of course, that never took place because lack of accountability during that period.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2016,  the  JICA  conducted  a  feasibility  study,  referred  to  as  the  Nadi  River  Basin 
<br/>Rehabilitation Project, and we were very keen on this.  We have already provided funding for this 
<br/>particular project because Nadi, as we know, is the gateway to Fiji.  The international airport is there, 
<br/>a lot of hotels are in that place and so connectivity, to connect Nadi with the rest of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project proposed by the team has a number of elements to it. There is 
<br/>retarding basin and a river improvement downstream, construction of ring dike downstream and river 
<br/>widening.  When I say river widening, it all means river deepening in midstream and replacement of 
<br/>the existing two bridges - one is what we call the “back road” and one is in the town area - retarding 
<br/>basins A and B, dam and river improvements in upstream and river improvements in the tributaries 
<br/>that feed into the Nadi River which is Nawaka, Malakua and Namosi Rivers and retarding basins in 
<br/>13 other sites.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>991 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nadi River Project is divided into three components.  Component A 
<br/>includes the Nadi Town surrounding dikes and inland drainage of soft component.  Sir, one of the 
<br/>issues in Nadi Town is that a lot of the drainages that actually go from the town has, in fact, over the 
<br/>years been built upon. There is one particular building opposite the Nadi Market and if you go and 
<br/>see, the building was not supposed to be built there. Yet, in the 1990s, the then Government allowed 
<br/>someone to put up a building on top of this major drainage outlet that takes out water from Nadi 
<br/>Town, and if you look underneath the building, you can see the drain but as you go along, it narrows 
<br/>and that is why we get a lot of flooding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second stage which is Component B is the combination of structural 
<br/>measure, including the widening and deepening of the river, construction of bridges, ring dikes and 
<br/>two  retention  ponds.    Essentially,  it  is  from  Nadi  Town  upwards,  going  up  to  the  back  road.  
<br/>Component C is the back road bridge and up that way which is the watershed management upstream.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  had  undertaken  widespread  discussions  with  interested 
<br/>development  partners  in  order  to  identify  suitable  partners  for  the  implementation  of  the  project.  
<br/>Since 2018 and 2019, the Government has spent around $4.2 million for the Nadi Flood Alleviation 
<br/>Project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had allocated funding in the 2021 Budget.  The Fijian Government allocated $3 million 
<br/>for the project of which, a sum of $1.8 million has already been utilised for the release of the EIA 
<br/>report and the engagement of Scope Pacific Fiji Limited in February 2022 to undertake an action 
<br/>plan for Project A. The Japanese Government, Sir, has agreed to support the project by way of a grant 
<br/>for Part A.  It is estimated to be about </span><span>¥</span><span>2.5 billion, equivalent to approximately FJ$46.9 million for 
<br/>the  implementation  of  Part  A.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  this  involves,  as  we  have  said,  the 
<br/>construction of surrounding dikes and inland town drainage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019-2020, Sir, the Fijian Government engaged the JIO Engineering Company of Japan to 
<br/>undertake the additional survey for Project A at a cost of US$848,000 or about FJ$1.5 million. The 
<br/>additional survey includes geographical and topographical studies and also updating of relevant data 
<br/>for Component A.  So, there is going to be a flood gate, Sir, dike gate for roads and rails, et cetera, 
<br/>because when you build a dike, you essentially will be ring-fencing the town against rising waters.  
<br/>It will be like building a dam, for want of a better word. We have already sent a Diplomatic Note to 
<br/>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formalise that grant component, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of stakeholder consultations, in fact, has been held in January 2022.  I 
<br/>remember  going  to  that  one,  Sir,  where  we  had  the  Nadi  Chamber  of  Commerce,  business 
<br/>communities, residents of Nadi and nearby villagers and communities, et cetera.  Again, Sir, we had 
<br/>highlighted this at the recent Budget consultation at the Nadi Town Hall.  Apart from the Budget 
<br/>itself,  we  had  a  presentation  on  the  Nadi  River  Rehabilitation  Programme  and  all  the  different 
<br/>components to the various groups, for example, Nakovacake, people we had met up with and various 
<br/>other groups we have met, in terms of telling them as to what exactly is going to happen.  A sum of 
<br/>$1.8 million as has been stated earlier, has been utilised for the release of EIA and the engagement 
<br/>of scope.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next steps, of course, we have also got the Minutes of discussions or the 
<br/>preparatory survey for the project for Nadi River Project and detailed project designs will be also 
<br/>issued, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding ADB, we have a bit of a disagreement. For Component B, Sir, as 
<br/>has  been  highlighted  in  a  number  of  other  projects,  we  believe  that  the  river  should,  in  fact,  be 
<br/>deepened to its original state.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>992 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted back in 2020 in Parliament, if you look at all the towns in Fiji, apart from Suva 
<br/>and perhaps one can argue Lautoka, all of them are built on riverbanks.  The reason why they were 
<br/>built on riverbanks, Sir, is because that is the mode of transportation in those days.  So, the ships 
<br/>would come from overseas and the cartage with the boats would actually go up the rivers themselves 
<br/>and then the towns will flourish around that.  Today,  you cannot even take a cartage up the Nadi 
<br/>River for that matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have highlighted, in the Sigatoka River, people are playing rugby at low tide in front of 
<br/>Laselase  Village,  opposite  Tappoos,  and  even  in  Ba  River.    That  is  why  dredging  is  critically 
<br/>important, to ensure that the depth of the river has enough capacity to convey that amount of water 
<br/>downstream and empty it out into the sea.  In fact, ADB’s proposal in component B was to keep it at 
<br/>the same depth but buy vast tracts of land around the river and create flood plains.  It actually means 
<br/>relocation of thousands of people and just keep those flood plains, so do not dig up the river and 
<br/>restore it to its original state.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, of course, have said, “no”, we need to ensure the river gets restored to its original depth.  
<br/>It can also restore the river life and the sea life that used to exist there, but because of years of silting 
<br/>that  does  not  take  place  anymore.    Now,  as  a  result  of  the  disagreement,  we  are  currently  in 
<br/></span><span>discussions and are now talking to a number of other developments partners, including the Asian 
<br/></span><span>Infrastructure  Investment  Bank.    We  are  also  talking  to  JICA  and  the  World  Bank.    In  fact,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  the  Australians  are  already  looking  at  component  C  -  the  Australian  Infrastructure 
<br/>Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP).  That, Sir, I would say, would be the most recent update. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  river  widening  and  deepening,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  from  Narewa  Village  and  all  the 
<br/>surrounding villages in that area, all the way up to Votualevu, around at the back end, which is one 
<br/>of the six priority projects proposed in the FS 2016 by JICA.  This will actually mean to cater for 
<br/>1,800 cubic metres of flood discharge, which is equal to design flood with the occurrence probability 
<br/>of one in a 50-year occurrence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can, of course, design, you can under design, you can over design, so 
<br/>the benchmark that we have used is that, it should be able to cater for one in a 50-year event.  You 
<br/>can do a one in a 100-year event, which is like a pandemic, drawing analogies between that.  That 
<br/>will, of course, mean a lot more deepening, a lot more widening and a lot more drainage systems, but 
<br/>if  you  cater  for  one  in  a  50-year  event,  we  believe  that  is  good  enough  to  be  able  to  meet  the 
<br/>conveyance of water in the one in a 50-year event.  So that, in a nutshell, Sir, is the current status of 
<br/>the Nadi River Rehabilitation Project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker; $2.156 million 
<br/>was allocated in the 2019-2020 Budget for the Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project.  The whole 
<br/>amount was then deployed to Judiciary, according to the final quarter Appropriation Statement for 
<br/>that year, why was the Government not serious about this critical issue for Nadi back then?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  the  honourable  Member  had 
<br/>actually asked that as her main question, but I knew that she would do something like that, so I have 
<br/>got  the  figures  here.    The  honourable  Member,  of  course,  forgets  that  we  had  this  thing  called 
<br/>COVID-19  and  when  we  do  all  these  international  engagements  and  we  bring  in  engineers  from 
<br/>overseas because with that capacity, it does not exist in Fiji, people do not travel during the COVID-
<br/>19 period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have got the figures here.  In 2019-2020, the figure was $7.9 million, then it was revised to 
<br/>$5 million in the COVID-19 Response Budget and $1.6 million was actually utilised.  Similarly, in 
<br/>2020-2021,  $5  million  was  allocated  and  $595,000  was  utilised.    I  have  the  breakdown  of  the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>993 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>payments  as  to  where  they  were  made  but  fundamentally,  work  could  not  continue  because  of 
<br/>lockdowns,  because  the  Japanese  refused  to  travel  during  that  particular  period,  understandably.  
<br/>Their country did not allow people to leave their country and consultants even from Australia and 
<br/>various other places, could not travel.  So, the honourable Member should rather in trying to look at 
<br/>these figures and say, “Oh wow, there is something there, they allocated, they have not spent”, she 
<br/>should actually look at it holistically which obviously, they have a problem with looking at things, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Rural Development Model Initiatives – Saemaul Undong 
<br/>(Question No. 71/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National  Security  and Policing, Rural 
<br/>and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update  Parliament  on  how  rural 
<br/>development model initiatives such as the Sauemaul Undong benefit rural and maritime 
<br/>communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for 
<br/></span><span>the question, on how rural development initiatives such as the Saemaul Undong Programme from the 
<br/>Government of South Korea benefit rural and maritime communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the few models that we are seriously looking at and we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also thankful that because of one of the participants, we have been able to pursue this further.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the other models, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the Sufficiency Economy model that 
<br/>was  designed  by  the  King  of  Thailand  and  we  are  also  looking  at  one  by  the  Government  of  Sri 
<br/>Lanka, which is the Ruhunu Rasara model, but I will concentrate on the Saemaul Undong model. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  few  years  back,  the  then  Permanent  Secretary  for  Public  Service 
<br/>Commission, Mr. Parmesh Chand, visited South Korea and he came with this model and discussed 
<br/>it with the Ministry of Rural Development.  In 2016, together with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we sent five of our people to South Korea - two from the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs, the Senior Assistant Roko in Macuata and the Senior Assistant Roko in Tailevu, 
<br/>together  with  three  Turaga-ni-koro.    One  from  Nabavatu  Village  in  Macuata,  one  from  Silana  in 
<br/>Tailevu and the other one is the Mata ni Tikina from Toga in Rewa.  They came back and as part of 
<br/>the training, they were  given tasks to implement before the team  from South Korea, the Saemaul 
<br/>Undong Team, could come over and visit the projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, the Turaga ni Koro in Nabavatu, Macuata, and the Mata ni Tikina in Toga, 
<br/>Rewa, did not do much of what they learnt.  We are thankful that the Mata ni Tikina from Silana in 
<br/>Dawasamu  did  an  excellent  work  in  the  implementation  of  this  Saemaul  Undong  initiative,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  I will dwell on that later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The word ‘Saemaul’ means new village and ‘Undong’ means movement, so it is about a new 
<br/>village movement that was adopted way back in the 1970s in South Korea.  It was regarded as one 
<br/>of  the  most  successful  long-term  economic  development  model  that  was  behind  the  Republic  of 
<br/>Korea’s  growth  in  the  1970s.  The  model  was  based  on  the  Saemaul  spirit,  focussing  on  three 
<br/>components - dilligence, self-help and co-operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated, ‘Saemaul’ means new village and ‘Undong’ means movement, and it was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mainly designed to overcome the endemic rural poverty in the 1970s in South Korea on three 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>successive stages: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Basic rural infrastructure; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Development; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Dissemination in terms of changing the mindset and confidence of the people to embrace 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the idea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the successful achievement of the Saemaul Undong (SMU) Model included 
<br/>rehabilitation  of  village  agricultural  production,  infrastructure,  construction  of  farm  roads, 
<br/>introduction  of  high  yielding  crop  varieties,  improvements  in  rural  housing  structures  and 
<br/>improvements in the overall rural environment such as rural electrification and telecommunication 
<br/>and significant increase in rural household income.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the success of this development model in South Korea, together with other 
<br/>countries, we have seen this being implemented and, of course, the model in Fiji particularly has been 
<br/>tailor-made to our local context, to ensure that our local communities are empowered and embrace 
<br/>this new idea of socio-economic transformation through a “can do” spirit.  This “can do” spirit has 
<br/>transformed the Government of South Korea from a donor-recipient country in the 1970s to a donor 
<br/></span><span>country in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century, in a span of less than 50 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Fiji context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Saemaul Undong Initiative was first introduced to 
<br/>Fiji through the signing of the MOU in 2018.  But as I have stated, prior to that, we sent the team 
<br/>across to go and study in South Korea on this model.  When it was initially signed, it was with the 
<br/>Ministry of Youth and Sports because the Minister was then in South Korea and he signed it and it 
<br/>was under the Ministry, but we  have now transferred it to the Ministry of Rural Development and 
<br/>we are thankful to the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports for facilitating this request.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2020, the Government of Korea has invested over FJ$286,000 in three 
<br/>villages. The three villages are Silana, Naimasimasi  and Mau in  Namosi, and we will still  revisit 
<br/>Macuata, particularly the Dreketi community in Nabavatu and, of course, we will revisit Rewa.  I 
<br/>have had some discussions with the </span><span>Marama na Roko Tui Dreketi</span><span> during tea break if she can assist 
<br/>with Rewa.  But these are the three villages that have been assisted because from Silana in Tailevu, 
<br/>the Turaga ni Koro who is now Mata ni Tikina, given his implementation of what he learnt, he has 
<br/>been widely used by the Tailevu Provincial Council Office to spread this concept.  We have seen 
<br/>significant  improvement,  particularly  in  most  villages,  but  Naimasimasi  and  Mau  have  also  been 
<br/>chosen to be part of this implementation under the current MOU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, $286,000 is for the improvement in sanitation, particularly from the 
<br/>transition  from  pit  toilets  to  flush  toilets  and  the  construction  of  septic  tanks.    Secondly,  is  the 
<br/>improvement  in  water  supply,  due  to  the  construction  of  water  dams  and  water  catchment 
<br/>improvements, community hall upgrades, footpaths and village drain construction and improvement 
<br/>and waste management improvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Silana,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  have  also  gone  ahead  because  they  were  the  initial 
<br/>implementers  of  the  Saemaul  Undong  Initiative.    They  are  now  also  focusing  on  their  livelihood 
<br/>projects through community work.  They are also focusing on improving, particularly agriculture-
<br/>related projects in the villages.  But let me just give  you a breakdown of how that $286,000 was 
<br/>spent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Silana, they were allocated about $95,468 and that includes the construction of footpaths 
<br/>and even driveway into the community, the community hall upgrade which included their kitchen, 
<br/>village office and dispensary.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, Silana last hosted the Tailevu Provincial 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Council  Meeting  and,  of  course,  one  community  toilet  and  two  village  footpaths  upgrade  and 
<br/>construction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Naimasimasi  Village,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  also  an  allocation  of  $95,000.    They  have 
<br/>completed five toilets and septic tanks and 25 are in the process of being constructed, the garbage 
<br/>collection improvement site and one small footbridge and crossing just next to the community hall.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Mau Village, Mr. Speaker, Sir, same allocation - $95,468.  The water improvement dam 
<br/>extension which includes the upgrade of the old existing dam, laying of water pipes to elevated areas 
<br/>to maintain water pressure, fixing of water tanks and connecting water pipes to affected households.  
<br/>The newly upgraded water system will benefit the whole village, consisting of 152 households with 
<br/>a population of 452 villagers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have also constructed one footpath and footbridge connecting the village and school, 
<br/>one village drain  upgrade and, of course, they upgraded their community  hall which includes the 
<br/>kitchen, office, toilet and bathroom and, of course, their evacuation centre and the improvement of 
<br/>their waste management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this ties in well with the </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> spirit that already exists in our rural 
<br/></span><span>communities.  So,  these  grant  initiatives  showcase  the  ability,  particularly  for  participatory  and 
<br/>inclusive modality, and it has created a sense of innovation in creative projects for the community 
<br/>and proactive approaches on the reduction of different vulnerabilities and social risks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just lately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, towards the end of last year, the Director-General of Saemaul 
<br/>Undong visited Fiji and we have had some serious discussions on the future of the project and, of 
<br/>course, the possibility of keep extending it into the other communities.  That is why we are targeting 
<br/>Macuata and, of course, Rewa, and hopefully, this will spread into other areas within Fiji as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  thankful  to  the  Government  of  Korea  for  this  partnership  and  we  also  thank  the 
<br/>Ministry of Youth and Sports for the initial three years in which this programme was under them, as 
<br/>well as the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs on us working together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is Government’s contribution to this?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is something that we also 
<br/>have  discussed  with  our  friends  from  South  Korea.    We  will  also  look  at  how  Government  can 
<br/>complement the work that is being undertaken and particularly, we have had discussions with these 
<br/>communities on their income generation projects for their economic empowerment.  Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for laying out what is 
<br/>happening with this Initiative,  but I do not hear anything about the economies of the villages.  Is that 
<br/>part of the equation that you uplift the economy of the villages?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I did state this yesterday as well when 
<br/>answering the questions on rural development that we are shifting from social projects into economic 
<br/>empowerment projects and this is one of the key initiatives.  As I have stated, in Silana, Dawasamu, 
<br/>they have already focussed on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  I  may  elaborate  on  it,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  they  have  done  in  Dawasamu  under  the 
<br/>Saemaul Undong initiative, let us say if this farmer’s main crop is chilli, so there will be a time in the 
<br/>month where the whole village will just go and work on the chilli’s farmer’s farm, so that he can 
<br/>produce more.  At the same time, weekly, there is a sort of a collection just to cater for emergencies 
<br/>(I would say) or some levies that may be given to the villages. That is also something that they are 
<br/>looking at.  This is where our government programme will also link up with them because we are

<div><span>looking at the potential in each of these communities.   In Dawasamu, they are heavily involved in 
<br/>fishing as well, so probably fishing boats, et cetera.  This is part of the work that we are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this, we are also concentrating on the youth and our women.  That is 
<br/>something that the team have discussed together with our counterparts from Korea.  Basically the 
<br/>idea  is,  you  deal  with  the  daily  issues  first  -  hygiene.    If  you  go  to  these  villages,  you  will  see 
<br/>collection points.  They will have a separate bag for glasses, plastics and household leftovers and 
<br/>then the daily lives like water and sanitation, the same thing with the Sufficiency Economy Model of 
<br/>Thailand. Eventually once this is accounted for, then the economic empowerment is the last thing 
<br/>that we will focus on once the other areas have been addressed.

<div><span>Regularisation of Expired Tenancy Agreements 
<br/>(Question No. 72/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  actions 
<br/></span><span>taken to regularise expired tenancy agreements on properties still occupied by Government 
<br/></span><span>agencies? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for this question.  The honourable Member asked about the expired tenancy agreements, I 
<br/>presume he means office space.  If he refers to Head 50 - SEG 5, you will see that we allocate about 
<br/>$35 million a year in renting office space throughout Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past number of years, of course, the number of tenancy agreements 
<br/>that  have been  entered into by previous  Governments and this Government  also  and any tenancy 
<br/>agreement that has been entered into previously, we obviously have a legal obligation to continue 
<br/>with those tenancies until they come to an end.  Unfortunately, one of the things that we have seen is 
<br/>that, a number of the tenancy agreements that did come were entered into by previous Governments 
<br/>for a very long term tenancy agreements without proper checks and balances.  So a lot of the buildings 
<br/>that  were  actually  leased  out,  for  example,  for  15  to  20  years  were  substandard  and  were  not 
<br/>necessarily built to requirements of government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can give you a case in point with the Suvavou House, you can have lifts that do not work 
<br/>for months.  There is absolutely nothing in the tenancy agreement that gives any relief to the tenant, 
<br/>which in this case is Government.  So members of the public who want to access offices on Levels 
<br/>2, 3 and 4, do not have to access it through the elevator, they have to climb up the stairs.  We have 
<br/>elderly people who cannot access the offices, so Government obviously, cops the blame for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not have enough waiting rooms.  We do not have, for example, Ministries like the 
<br/>Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, separate rooms for women who may come 
<br/>with their children, there is no feeding area, et cetera.  We have been lumped with these buildings so 
<br/>what we have been doing, Sir, in the past number of years is, we have been improving the tenancy 
<br/>agreements. Whenever a tenancy agreement comes to an end, we are now entering into only three-
<br/>year tenancy agreements or five-year tenancy at the most, where there is a requirement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  those  cases,  we  then  have  the  landlords  being  able  to  provide  that 
<br/>particular service to us as tenants. We are forking out a lot of money in that respect and we expect 
<br/>value for money. There are about 40 tenancy agreements, honourable Vosanibola, that you would 
<br/>probably be concerned about through your question, that are being done on a month-to-month basis, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>997 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whilst we are renegotiating the tenancy agreement to put in clauses that are more suitable to us as 
<br/>tenants because obviously, when we are paying money, we are paying top money.  We are paying 
<br/>market rates and we expect the same level of service from those buildings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another case in point is that, if we look at the MOIT building in Samabula which used to be 
<br/>a cinema before, absolutely, there are no windows on either side of the building because it was a 
<br/>cinema.  The rent, I have just got a confirmation that was over $200,000 for the renting that place - 
<br/>a very basic building, a cinema, someone said it used to be the inn at that time, PSC used to rent all 
<br/>the buildings. We have seen a number of cases which we can highlight as the honourable Vosanibola 
<br/>asked that question. In fact, the Elections Office at one stage under the old system, three floors, each 
<br/>floor was about $25,000 a month of rent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is how much money was being forked 
<br/>out to these private individuals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua talks about corruption, that is what she should be looking at. We 
<br/>are now actually holding accountable these landlords. No one can simply come in and have a mate 
<br/>in and get a tenancy agreement, but we now have people paying the market rate.  Every time there is 
<br/>a power blackout or water shortage, there is no backup generator or there are no water tanks. As a 
<br/>Government,  we  need  to  be  able  to  continue  with  the  services.  Our  civil  servants  need  a  better 
<br/></span><span>environment to be able to ensure that we provide a good workplace environment.  Therefore, we are 
<br/></span><span>building and entering into tenancies that will actually provide the right work environment and the 
<br/>right service environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You would have seen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also that Government advertised some time back and 
<br/>calling  for  the  construction  of  buildings  where  the  private  sector  can  actually  build.    In  those 
<br/>arrangements, we will specify what we want, they build to our specifications, they put  the capital 
<br/>upfront  and  we  can  then  enter  into  long  term  agreements  if  it  is  built  to  our  specifications.  The 
<br/>Ministry  of  Education  is  actually  strewn  across,  I  think,  about  nine  or  ten  different  locations 
<br/>throughout Suva.  So the Ministry of Education is not a one-stop shop - Exams Office is somewhere 
<br/>else, another office is somewhere else.  Even Poverty Alleviation is somewhere, half of it is is spread 
<br/>across.  You have half of the Lands Department in there, the other half - the Maps, is in Raojibhai 
<br/>Patel Street.  It used to be stuck in some old corner of an office.  Someone obviously got a sweet 
<br/>deal.  I have actually been to that building. The paint on the walls is peeling off because it is built 
<br/>right  next  to  Nabukalou  Creek  and  there  is  dampness  coming  through.  The  seepage  is  coming 
<br/>through, the maps are getting old, they are deteriorating even before it is supposed to deteriorate. 
<br/>That is what we are doing and part of the deal that we have announced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have called for expressions of interest and Cabinet has just recently approved.  We will, 
<br/>in fact, be announcing all those different companies that will be doing the construction - the right to 
<br/>build those buildings for us or ministries. We will be putting the Ministry of Education in one building 
<br/>and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation all in one building. So all the people 
<br/>who need to access those services can go to one place. So you can have one entire building dedicated 
<br/>to that.  We want to have, for example, coffee shops, service areas for members of the public and for 
<br/>the  staff,  better  working  environment  and  not  being  stuck  in  cubicles  with  no  windows  and  no 
<br/>ventilation - that is what we are doing. This is part of the process.  We are reviewing the tenancy 
<br/>agreement on that basis but we will also be entering into new tenancy agreements where we can enter 
<br/>into long term agreements, as long as they build it according to our specifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Will the Government consider updating its building codes to cater 
<br/>for the requirements that the Government is looking at which, I  believe, is good and that can all be 
<br/>addressed, Mr. Speaker, in the building codes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  It  is  a separate  matter altogether. Of  course,  the building 
<br/>codes are being reviewed but let us not deviate from the main point.  It has nothing to do with building 
<br/>codes. You have to have buildings that are built to your specifications. The building code does not 
<br/>say, “You can have a feeding room”. The building code does not necessarily say that your lift must 
<br/>be working all the time.  It is the responsibility of the landlord to do so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  it  is  also  the  responsibility  of  the  tenant  who  is  negotiating  to  ensure  that  the 
<br/>building which you are going to lease is actually built for purpose, it is built to your specification.  If 
<br/>it is not, then you should not be leasing it because you should actually provide a good workplace 
<br/>environment for the civil servants.  You should also ensure that the toilets are working all the time, 
<br/>there is enough ventilation there, and that has got nothing to do with building codes. That is to do 
<br/>with  the  quality  of  landlord  and  tenancy  relationship,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  that  has  not  been 
<br/>happening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Most of the Ministries require, for example, screens whether it is for zoom meetings, whether 
<br/>it is presentations, there is no dropdown screen, there is no proper air conditioning, air conditioning 
<br/>is  an  afterthought,  there  is  no  aesthetic  in  respect  of  how  the  building  looks,  there  is  not  enough 
<br/>ventilation, there is not enough natural sunlight coming through. These are the specifications that we 
<br/></span><span>want these new buildings to have.  If we have enough natural sunlight coming through, you do not 
<br/></span><span>need to turn on the lights during the day, you save electricity cost.  These are the sort of things, the 
<br/>finer points of your tenancy that we are looking at, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  previous  administration,  provincial 
<br/>companies  were  encouraged  to  build  and  rent  out  to  Government.  Some  of  those  leases  are  now 
<br/>coming for review and most were built at that time, Sir, and they need to be brought up to speed with 
<br/>modern appointments, as the honourable Minister is highlighting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Would the Government help the provincial companies upgrade these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>facilities so that they may continue to retain the patronage of Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, any landlord or any company that wishes 
<br/>to become a landlord can apply through the normal process, that is what we are doing.   Suvavou 
<br/>House, for example, has a 20-year lease.  By now, they should have more than three times paid off 
<br/>their  loan  and  started  making  profits.    But  what  we  have  noticed  is  that,  in  many  of  these 
<br/>organisations, money is being siphoned out on the side.  People are not actually doing the right thing, 
<br/>there  is  no  proper  accountability.    The  same  thing  that  is  happening  with  the  Kadavu  Provincial 
<br/>Building.  We actually paid a million dollars just to get out of that contract because we knew that that 
<br/>building was built to substandard.  The UN is now telling us that one of the walls or one of the floors 
<br/>has actually cracked and one of them fell down on someone.  That is the quality of the buildings that 
<br/>were being built. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Exactly what we were…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  should  have  never  built  it.    There 
<br/>should have been proper accountability.  People were dodgy and if you look at the shareholders of 
<br/>that company, there were people who were siphoning off funds.  The point being, Sir, is that whoever 
<br/>wants to lend or  lease buildings or floor space to us, we will treat everyone equally.  We will ensure 
<br/>that if they meet the specifications.  There is one particular provincial council that is currently talking 
<br/>to us and they are going to build something specific to our requirements and we will go ahead with 
<br/>them. We will have a very good relationship as landlord and tenants.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>999 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister;  for  those  places  outside  of  the  CBD,  will  the  Government  consider  assisting  provincial 
<br/>councils who intend to build so that Government can rent, in places like Vunidawa, for example?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  the  honourable  Member  who  obviously  sees  himself 
<br/>representing Naitasiri,  already knows that we have been  discussing with  people from Naitasiri  in 
<br/>respect  to  that.  But  again,  like  you  said,  if  there  is  a  need  for  it,  we  will  then  only  rent  it.  The 
<br/>Government’s model is this, we want people to build it for us. They need to come up with the upfront 
<br/>funds.  We will, of course, in return, give them a long term lease, if they build it to our specifications, 
<br/>and that is the basis on why people can go and borrow money.  But, they need to ensure that they 
<br/>simply do not get a free ride, and Ba Provincial Holdings is a classic example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on about it.  Honourable Saukuru should know about this.  For the 
<br/>Family Court and Magistrates Court, the toilets do not work.  Half of their building is non-operational 
<br/>at times, things are falling down and dilapidated, yet, the Government year-on-year, using tax payers 
<br/>funds, is actually paying the market rent for this, and there is abuse in that  Holding Company.  There 
<br/>is an abuse of funds in the Ba Provincial Holdings.  There is fraction, there is friction and there are 
<br/>fractures in that company itself.  Funds have gone missing.  That is what is happening, and here they 
<br/></span><span>come and pontificate on that basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to be able to deliver the service that we, as tenants, 
<br/>want.  Not to get a free ride, but we all assist people.  Like I said, there is one provincial council that 
<br/>is actually talking to us, we are looking at entering into a tenancy agreement with them because they 
<br/>will do the right thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budgetary Allocation for Electrification Projects  
<br/>(Question No. 73/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>budgetary  allocation  for  electrification  projects  by  Government  and  in  which  particular 
<br/>areas this will be targeted? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for this question.  The Electrification Programme under the FijiFirst Government has been 
<br/>one of the most empowering programmes ever undertaken by any Fijian Government in such a short 
<br/>time.  It is the fact.  Honourable Gavoka, please, listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, never before and it is fact, you can actually verify this.  If you look at their 
<br/>kilometres of electrical cables that have been laid since 2012 uptil now and if you compare it to any 
<br/>other period in Fijian Government history, it has been the fastest at such a huge rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since  2012, we allocated $237.2 million  for what  we call in  those days, 
<br/>Rural Electrification Projects, we actually now call it Electrification Projects because it is not only 
<br/>confined to rural areas, there are some peri-urban areas that do not even have electricity, so we are 
<br/>also connecting those people too.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, also, its solar panelling too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of the $237.2 million allocation, $187.4 million has, in fact, been utilised.  Of course, some 
<br/>of it had to be put on hold because of things like COVID-19, we had cyclones and we had to re-divert 
<br/>funds.  I will give you a breakdown, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2012, $9.9 million was actually budgeted for.  The amount used, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was 
<br/>$10.6 million, in other words, more was used.  They vired it and got more because more projects 
<br/>were being done.  In 2013, $9.9 million was allocated and $9.3 million was used.  In 2014, $22.8 
<br/>million  was allocated  and $21.68 million  was used.   In 2015, $22 million  was allocated  and $12 
<br/>million was used.  In 2016, $13.2 million was allocated and $13.2 million was used.  In 2016, $18.02 
<br/>million was allocated and $17.91 million was used.  In 2017, $42 million was allocated, in fact, they 
<br/>went over budget and used $43 million.  In 2018, $61 million was allocated and $42 million was 
<br/>used.  In 2019-2020, $17 million was allocated and $10 million was used.  In 2020, $7.8 million was 
<br/>allocated and $4.9 million was used.  In 2021-2022, $10.3 million was allocated and, of course, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to date, we have used $9.6 million and the year is yet to end. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of that, and as we have seen, for example, along the Kings Road, we 
<br/>have  extended  the  grid  itself,  that  is,  electrification.  There  is  also  what  we  call  the  solar  system 
<br/>projects which are standalone systems where people have been given access to solar systems where 
<br/>they are too far away from the grid so they cannot actually be connected to the grid and it is done a 
<br/>lot quicker.  Since 2014, Sir, the number of schemes that have actually been approved and, in fact, 
<br/>been connected were 491 schemes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the changes that we have also done now is before, when we had these 
<br/></span><span>grid extensions, EFL would actually do what we call the grid extension, and the house wiring which 
<br/>is what they call the black wiring when colloquially speaking, was done by the Department of Energy.  
<br/>In  order  to  bring  a  lot  more  synergy  now  and  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  disconnection,  the  entire 
<br/>contract is now given to EFL. So, EFL has to do the grid extension, they also have to do the black 
<br/>wiring  because  in  some  cases,  what  we  used  to  have,  the  grid  will  go  but  the  black  wiring  was 
<br/>delayed.  So, people will say, “Hang on, what is happening”, or in some instances, the black wiring 
<br/>was done but the grid actually do not come along so people will say, “Oh, there is a disconnection.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to avoid the disconnection, Sir, from the recent Budget, we are now saying that EFL 
<br/>will be given the entire contract.  So, they will be responsible both, for the grid extension and for the 
<br/>black wiring.  So the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Economy and other stakeholders can 
<br/>actually go to one organisation which is EFL and say, “What is actually happening with this particular 
<br/>project?”  That, we are seeing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is working out a lot better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Honourable Member, in fact, had asked for the areas which will be upgraded, Sir.  During 
<br/>the next three financial years, the Fijian Government will be allocating more than $20 million to fund 
<br/>a total of 178 schemes.  These areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will benefit about 10,000 Fijians living in the 
<br/>various areas, for example, in the Western Division, these includes:  Mavua and Navuto in Sigatoka; 
<br/>Dratabu,  Lavusa  and  some  areas  in  Votualevu  in  Nadi;  Abaca,  Natawarau,  Lovu,  Tavakubu  and 
<br/>households without electricity living along the Vuda Back Road in Lautoka; Balevuto, Moto, Vatusui 
<br/>and  Vakabuli  in  Ba;  Waiqumu  Settlement,  Wairuku,    Nadele,  Nabuna,  Toko  and  Vuniniurea  in 
<br/>Tavua; Navolau, Tavuvatu and Naqaqa in Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Northern Division, areas such as: Muqumuqumu, Bulileka and Korotari in Labasa; 
<br/>Nabalebale, Matakunea, Nasavu, Natuvu and Natua in Savusavu; Drekeniwai and Boruto in Taveuni. 
<br/>So, those are the areas that will be connected in the next three financial years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government will also ensure that those in the Central Division that do not 
<br/>have access to electricity in areas such as Korovou, Tailevu, Namosi, Naitasiri and Serua will also 
<br/>be connected to the grid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have got a list of all of these villages here that have been connected in the past number of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years and, of course, we have continuously invited honourable Members of the Opposition, if they

<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister; for those EFL customers whose houses were destroyed by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016, how do 
<br/>they get Government to resolve their electricity plight? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir,  I  did  not  hear the first  part of the  question, can  you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please, repeat it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- For those EFL customers whose house were destroyed by  </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span> in 2016, they still have yet to be connected to electricity, how do they get Government to 
<br/>resolve their plight?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- They have to apply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- They have already applied.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  if  the  honourable  Member  is  saying  that  they  have 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Update on the Government Rural Housing Scheme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 74/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.A.R. SENILOLI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>Government Rural Housing Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member  for  this  question.    This  particular  Programme  has  evolved  over  a  period  of  time,  not 
<br/>necessarily for good reasons but it has been a kind metamorphosis in respect of this Rural Housing 
<br/>Project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It actually started in 1976, as far as the record show, that we had what we call Rural Housing 
<br/>Project and it was essentially confined to the rural and maritime areas.  Over the past 45 years or so, 
<br/>some form of assistance has been provided - sometimes it is not very good, sometimes it is all right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2005,  the  One-Third  and  Two-Third  Assistance  Programme  for  Rural  Housing  was 
<br/>introduced under the previous Government.  Under that particular Programme, the applicant pays 
<br/>one-third of the material cost and Government assists with the two-third balance of the material cost, 
<br/>procurement and delivery of the materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the Government actually focusses on the financial assistance, there 
<br/>was not much focus on the quality of the houses that were built and that was a huge problem because 
<br/>obviously as we know in the rural setting or village setting, a lot of people have moved away from 
<br/>the </span><span>bure</span><span> to build something a bit more substantial to withstand climatic changes, et cetera.  So, whilst 
<br/>the funding was provided, there was not much emphasis given on the engineering standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Development,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was 
<br/>established in  2018, the administration of the Rural  Housing Assistance  was transferred  from  the 
<br/>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and the review of the Rural Housing Assistance was

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actually a key task undertaken by the Ministry itself as immediate steps to improving the quality of 
<br/>housing in rural areas.  The Ministry made improvements to the 24 feet x 16 feet open house plan 
<br/>with assistance from registered engineers. However, there were about 64 applicants who were still 
<br/>part of the old project under the old Scheme, and they were actually assisted under the old Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  the  Programme,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  fact,  has  identified  many  areas  of 
<br/>improvement.  The One-Third and Two-Third Programme was, in fact, designed primarily to assist 
<br/>rural community development projects, such as upgrading, and also assist in roads, community halls 
<br/>and repairing culverts.  It was not solely for individual households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  assistance  was  only  rendered  to  households  within  village  boundaries  in  rural  and 
<br/>maritime areas, and excluded other Fijians living outside of those areas or within rural boundaries.  
<br/>So, we see a lot of settlements that are now developing, for example, in Deuba and various other 
<br/>places, so they do not actually qualify for that.  This, of course, excludes a large proportion of Fijians 
<br/>living in those areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per the 2017 Census, Sir, there were about 10,274 people on Freehold titles; 6,633 State 
<br/>leases;  17,475 leases  with  iTaukei  Lands Trust  Board, in  rural  areas in  Fiji.  As  I have said,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker,  Sir,  a  lot  of  this  focuses  on  the  financial  side  of  things,  as  opposed  to  the  engineering 
<br/></span><span>standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Rural  Housing  Assistance  Programme  aims  to  introduce  a  more 
<br/>sustainable and climate-resilient housing assistance in rural areas.  The Assistance under the new 
<br/>policy will be extended to all Fijians living in the rural areas, provided they are either part of the 
<br/>landowning unit, they are building their own homes within the village boundaries, or they hold other 
<br/>areas for which they have some form of title.  Sir, applicants will require to produce a house plan 
<br/>certified  by  a  recognised  engineer  for  Category  4  Cyclone  standards.    We  actually  have  that 
<br/>ourselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To assist the applicants in this, the Ministry has introduced a Category 4 Engineer Certified 
<br/>two-bedroom house plan which is available for free to any Fijian, so they can copy that.  The plan 
<br/>comes with the full list of materials required to build their house to specific standards.  The Ministry 
<br/>is currently negotiating the prices of the building materials with major hardware suppliers so that 
<br/>successful applicants can purchase materials at those agreed prices because what we can do is, we 
<br/>can have some people, for example, who can price gouge.  We do not want these people turning up 
<br/>with the money and the hardware company is actually putting up their rates when they know it is 
<br/>coming from Government.  The new house plan, Sir, covers 47 square metres, and it includes two 
<br/>spaces bedrooms, living area, a kitchen and sanitation facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, successful applicants under the new policy will receive a grant assistance 
<br/>of  up  to  $10,000  to  purchase  building  materials  -  $8,500  and  transportation,  for  example,  in  the 
<br/>maritime areas; sea cartage - $1,500 to applicants from the maritime areas or sometimes from the 
<br/>deep rural areas, they need a lot of cartage for that too.  Prices negotiated with hardware companies 
<br/>will be inclusive with transportation either in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new policy also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises the importance for gender inclusiveness in 
<br/>the rural housing sector.  This is one main for moving away from the traditional open plan house 
<br/>structures and introducing two bedrooms so you have some privacy, et cetera, separate kitchen, living 
<br/>area  and  sanitation  facilities.    The  house  plan  can  also  easily  accommodate  changes  to  improve 
<br/>accessibility with ramps for people with disabilities.  As the Member would also notice, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, under the revised budget, we have allocated from now until the end of the financial year $600,000 
<br/>to implement this revised policy.

<div><span>National Substance Abuse Advisory Council Counselling Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 75/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Local 
<br/>Government  update  Parliament  on  the  counselling  services  provided  by  the  National 
<br/>Substance Abuse Advisory Council (NSAAC) to students during this pandemic? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>Our  children  have  suffered  immensely  with  the  spread  of  Coronavirus  across  the  nation.    Some 
<br/>children  lost  their  loved-ones,  others  faced  emotional  and  physical  abuse,  neglect,  cyberbullying, 
<br/>violence and drug abuse.  During this time, counselling services provided solace to heal their pain 
<br/>and suffering.  The pandemic caused hardship to  many families because  of job  losses or reduced 
<br/>hours of work.  With children at home, restricted movement and financial issues, it was a difficult 
<br/>experience for many families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When such situation arise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impact is felt by our children as well.  We 
<br/></span><span>were not alone in this.  Many countries around the world had similar experiences.  There are several 
<br/></span><span>reports by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
<br/>and  Cultural  Organisation  (UNESCO)  and  the  World  Bank  that  document  the  impact  of  school 
<br/>closure and downturn of the economy on children.  These reports showed that during school closure, 
<br/>children’s health and safety were jeopardised particularly with an increase in domestic violence and 
<br/>child labour. The mental health crisis amongst young people also reached unprecedented levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NSAAC has been working closely with the Ministry of Education to provide 
<br/>training and workshop for the teachers as well as counselling and support services for students.  The 
<br/>counselling  services  for  students  were  provided  by  four  divisional  counsellors,  33  teacher 
<br/>counsellors,  913  trained  child  protection  officers  and  NGOs  such  as  Medical  Services  Pacific, 
<br/>Empower Pacific and Lifeline Fiji.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the eight months of school closure, NSAAC provided counselling 
<br/>via  phone  to  their  student  clients.    They  also  worked  closely  with  the  head  of  school  to  identify 
<br/>students who needed counselling.  The counsellors conducted phone counselling for 82 students and 
<br/>two teachers during the lockdown.  During COVID, NSAAC sent psychosocial support messages to 
<br/>students,  parents  and community members through social media platforms  such as  </span><span>Facebook </span><span>and</span><span>
<br/>Instagram</span><span> with the assistance of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the facility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the psychosocial support information flyers were sent to schools to help the 
<br/>teachers to prepare themselves before students returned for face-to-face classes. In anticipation of the 
<br/>help that may be required by students when they return to school, NSAAC in collaboration with the 
<br/>Ministry and UNICEF took advantage of the school closure and provided online training to 913 child 
<br/>protection officers.  This was done to ensure child protection officers could provide immediate basic 
<br/>support to students and refer more challenging cases to NSAAC and other NGOs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When schools re-opened, the psychosocial support services programme was developed for 
<br/>Years 12 and 13 by NSAAC.   Mr. Speake, Sir, NSAAC staff along with the 33 ministry counsellors 
<br/>and  schools  child  protection  officers  conducted  the  support  programme.    Students  who  needed 
<br/>individual  help  were  also  assisted  through  one-to-one  counselling  session.    These  psychosocial 
<br/>support services programme was conducted in the first week of November when school re-opened 
<br/>for  face-to-face  classes.    A  total  of  129  secondary  schools  were  visited  to  provide  psychosocial

<div><span>support services to 8,934 students and 680 teachers.  Around 60 students and 7 teachers were assisted 
<br/>with one-to-one counselling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2021,  a  total  of  316  students  were  counselled  between  January  and 
<br/>December.    All  child  abuse  cases  were  referred  to  Social  Welfare  and  a  follow-up  was  made  by 
<br/>NSAAC to ensure that the safety and welfare of the students were not compromised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  234  students  received  counselling  from  4</span><span>th</span><span>  January  to  31</span><span>st</span><span>  March,  2022 
<br/>when school re-opened this year.  According to the data collected by NSAAC, the pressing issues 
<br/>identified with students were sexual abuse at home and in the community which was reported by 
<br/>students,  mental  health  issues  and  depression  where  students  inflicted  self-harm  because  of  the 
<br/>underlying negative emotions caused by the trauma they had experienced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Students reported challenges they faced from their own families such as abuse, neglect, break-
<br/>up or relocation.  Students using drugs in the school compound and this was reported when I visited 
<br/>more  than  70  schools  during  this  period.    Students  displayed  violent  behaviour  in  school,  some 
<br/>students were cyber-bullied by other students on social media using vulgar words and sex-related 
<br/>clips.  Teenage pregnancy also increased during the lockdown.  While comparing data from recent 
<br/></span><span>years, the most common issues were violence, drugs and cyberbullying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank NSAAC staff, child protection officers, counsellors, NGOs, heads 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of schools and teachers for working together to protect our children from social and mental issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for raising this question. It is very important concerning our students. My supplementary question to 
<br/>the honourable Minister is, in the long term, is Government considering establishing a rehabilitation 
<br/>centre for young people given that St. Giles is not fit for these special purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  I think that question should be directed to  honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social Welfare.

<div><span>Staff Retention Initiatives/Policies – Civil Service

<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on 
<br/>Government’s  staff  retention  initiatives/policies  for  skilled  and  technical  areas  in  civil 
<br/>service? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I could just  be allowed, I had mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in my earlier question about the rental and I wish the </span><span>de facto</span><span> deputy leader of paapi was here.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The </span><span>de facto</span><span> leader of paapi, honourable Prof. Prasad.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1005 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the SVT days, Nasilivata House which I mentioned, the rent for that 
<br/>which  entered into long term agreement for an old cinema was $61,881 per month (VEP),  annual 
<br/>rental - $742,572 (VEP) a year for that building. That is the kind of tenancy agreements that previous 
<br/>governments as SVT had entered in to. Nearly three quarters of a million dollars a year we are paying 
<br/>for the junk building – 20-year lease or whatever it was and that is where the money is going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Tuisawau does  not know that  I  have answered this question 
<br/>partially the other day. As announced in the Budget that we have allocated $50,000 to carry out a 
<br/>scarce skills review in the civil service. These allocations will in fact fund research that will identify 
<br/>those  highly  skilled  positions  across  the  Government  and  further  identify  the  underlying  reasons 
<br/>contributing towards the scarcity of that skill. For example, surveyors in the Ministry of Lands, local 
<br/>tertiary institutions do not offer Degree level programmes which means that Diploma level graduates 
<br/>need to undertake longer years of practical to in fact become a registered surveyor and specialized 
<br/>skills cannot be gained in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, surveyors used to work in the private sector because the remuneration is a lot 
<br/>higher. Recently the Head of our Climate Change Division was poached by a UN agency. We had, 
<br/>for example, the Head of our Communications section, the gentleman who rolled out all the ground 
<br/></span><span>breaking work we did a few years ago, he has been poached by the World Bank.  He has now become 
<br/></span><span>the regional expert for them and laying up projects across the Pacific. We have, for example, some 
<br/>of the nurses, of course, because of the pandemic, a lot of overseas countries are requiring our nurses. 
<br/>We have Indian nurses moving across to UK, they are providing services there. We actually have a 
<br/>lot private sector organisations that are getting to the medical field.  So the Private Hospital like De 
<br/>Asa has opened one up and various other people in Walu Bay, others are being opened up. They are 
<br/>also being poached, they poach these young, trained or good trained nurses in the system, some of 
<br/>them 10 to 15 years, now they are going to these private institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, obviously there is movement of labour across the different organisations, global trends 
<br/>change and of course, trends within our country itself changes. For example, a huge demand for IT 
<br/>specialists not just in Fiji but in Australia and New Zealand. They are poaching some of our best and 
<br/>brightest.  We also need our ITC Centre to be run properly by good people, young, trained people or 
<br/>older trained people.  So this is what we are looking at in terms of the scarcity of the skills sets but 
<br/>also retention is critically important for us, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that also needs to be made is not only about wages or salaries. It is also about 
<br/>having a right work environment. As we mentioned earlier on, we need to provide good work places 
<br/>for them. They need to have all the tools, work in offices that are salubrious and that are enticing for 
<br/>them to stay in, and have proper ventilation and lighting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> People  want  those  types  of  things,  they  need  to  be  able  to  understand,  know  and  feel 
<br/>confident in the system that if they perform their high performer, they will get recognised for that 
<br/>high performance. They are not going to be actually promoted based on seniority but on capacity and 
<br/>capability  and  what  they  can  deliver.  That  is  what  they  need  to  feel  confident  about  because 
<br/>workplace environment is not just about wages and salaries but about the environment itself that you 
<br/>work within and also having the confidence in the system to know that if you are a high-flyer, you 
<br/>would  be  recognised  for  that.    If  you  want  to  apply  for  jobs,  everyone  will  be  treated  on  a  level 
<br/>playing field and that is what actually helps people stay in jobs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F  TUISAWAU.-  Staff  retention  can  also  be  affected  by  leadership  and 
<br/>management  issues.  Some  of  the  major  complaints  which  have  been  coming  through  is  the 
<br/>management of contracts, where contracts have come to an end and civil servants have been given 
<br/>short-term  contracts  which  affects  their  job  security,  et  cetera.  So,  the  question  is,  what  is  the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government doing to rectify that problem when the contract comes to an end and nothing is done to 
<br/>renew or advertise and they are given short-time contracts, monthly contracts?  What is being done 
<br/>about that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I wish the honourable Member had actually asked that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>substantive question.  That appears to be a substantive question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Yes, we can ask the question anytime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- His question, Mr. Speaker, says, “ Can the Minister update 
<br/>Parliament on Government’s staff retention  initiatives/policies for skilled and technical  areas…?” 
<br/>Now, he is talking about general contract conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have highlighted to Parliament time and time again, this does not fit 
<br/>in with your narrative, that is the problem.  All of you are going out, trying to create this  disquiet 
<br/>amongst civil servants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As any civil servant would know, Sir, if he/she initially takes up a position, you give/her a 
<br/></span><span>three-year contract.  If, at the end of three  years’ assessment he/she performed above a particular 
<br/></span><span>level, he/she is given a five-year contract.  Most of the people who have actually been through the 
<br/>three-year cycle all have five-year contracts.  I cannot understand what he is going on about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We did say in Parliament a few years ago that some HR Departments in some of the Ministries 
<br/>and, again, there was no investment in the HR Departments of many Ministries.  We have said this 
<br/>on the record also, some of the Ministries need to strengthen their HR Department.  The HR people 
<br/>need to know, for example, that the contracts of these 10 people are about to expire in six months’ 
<br/>time, so they need to start the particular process so that people know before their contract expire, 
<br/>whether they will be renewed or not, and that needs to be done in time.  That is the point we are 
<br/>making and I have continuously said this in Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am again emphasising 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was some issues with some of the Ministries and that has been rectified. If there are 
<br/>one or two instances where they have not, please, bring it to the attention of the respective Ministers 
<br/>or respective Permanent Secretaries and get it addressed.  But do not use one or two examples to try 
<br/>and  shoot  down  an  entire  system  which  is  working  well,  which  is  actually  giving  a  lot  of  young 
<br/>people the opportunity to work in the Civil Service, a lot of people in the private sector to come and 
<br/>work in the Civil Service, bring a particular skillset that is still required in the Civil Services and to 
<br/>be able to improve the quality of the workplace environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Sir,  as  we  are  still  on  staff  retention,  recently,  we  had  massive 
<br/>resignation  of  nurses  in  the  Ministry.  Does  the  Ministry  has  a  plan  to  improve  their  working 
<br/>conditions and increase their salary for retention purposes?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, as highlighted previously  and, again,  I had  answered 
<br/>this question in many ways, honourable Kuridrani should take heed of what we have said. We had 
<br/>said that nurses in respect of their movement, there is a lot of demand for them from overseas.  If you 
<br/>look at the people who are resigning, where are they going? That is what you need to look at.  It is 
<br/>not just simply the question of resignation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, if they are resigning, for example, to go overseas, whether we paid them three or four 
<br/>times more their salary, obviously they will go, you cannot stop them.  So, do not just come here and 
<br/>say, “Oh, they have resigned, therefore, there is something bad.”  But they are going for alternative

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>employers that may be offering lots of money. We cannot, actually, offer that amount of money.  We 
<br/>cannot compete with the salaries in the United Arab Emirates.  Those guys have oil, we do not have 
<br/>oil. There were huge shortage of people, they have a much larger population, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, some of them are resigning, as I have mentioned earlier on, because they are going 
<br/>to  some of the private hospitals, the private health  centres, some of the  private GPs  and one just 
<br/>opened opposite the QVS Boys Club – the MIOT facility.  Maybe when I say QVS Old Boys Club, 
<br/>you may know where it is. Some of the nurses I have seen there have actually gone from the public 
<br/>health sector, some of them have gone from Suva Private Hospital to there, so there i is movement 
<br/>of people.  De Asa’s Hospital, there is a hospital in Walu Bay. I have got some other companies that 
<br/>want to set up a private clinic also.  Zens employ so many nurses, and the problem for us, of course, 
<br/>is that they are taking people who we have trained and so for us, that is an issue.  It is an HR issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  them,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  not  be  happy  with  the  conditions.    We  have  now 
<br/>restarted and reignited the overtime as announced in the Budget.  Honourable Kuridrani, read the 
<br/>Budget!  The nurses are the only ones that get overtime in the Category F.  No other civil servant in 
<br/>Category F gets overtime, except nurses.  If you look at their salary increment that took place in some 
<br/>of the different categories of nurses, it went up in some areas by 39 percent, 42 percent.  Please, look 
<br/></span><span>at that.  As also announced, that is part of the Civil Service reform.  We have allocated this funding 
<br/></span><span>to look at areas where there is shortage of skillsets.  We will be reviewing those areas also which, of 
<br/>course, includes the nurses also.

<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament of the latest 
<br/>update pertaining to the first home owners grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for this question.  This is actually a very highly successful programme that was launched by 
<br/>Government.    The  first  time  it  started  was  in  2014,  and  the  idea  was  to  assist,  in  particular,  low 
<br/>income  Fijian  families,  to  buy  or  build  their  first  home,  because  we  have  seen  the  rate  of  home 
<br/>ownership in Fiji is very low.  As a result of that, many Fijians do not have an asset against which 
<br/>they can borrow in the future.  This is why we find a lot of people, for example, go to moneylenders 
<br/>for small loans, because they do not actually have an asset they can take to mainstream financial 
<br/>institutions, use that as collateral and be able to borrow against that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Programme which started in 2014, we gave an assistance of $10,000 to 
<br/>Fijians with an annual household income of $50,000 and below.  In 2018, this further expanded by 
<br/>increasing the First Home Grant to $15,000, and also introducing the First Land Purchase Grant of 
<br/>$10,000 for Fijians buying their first residential piece of land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the financial year 2020-2021, the First Home Grant was further increased 
<br/>to $30,000 and we also had two categories in that.  If you earn a household income of $50,000 or 
<br/>less, if you are building your first home, you get a grant of $30,000.  If you earn more than $50,000 
<br/>but less than $100,000, you get a grant of $15,000, if you are building your first home.  If you are 
<br/>buying your first home, the amount is lesser than the building grant, so one is $15,000 and the other 
<br/>one is $5,000.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2020-2021 financial year, the Ministry paid $7.5 million under this 
<br/>assistance programme to 433 successful applicants.  This was the highest payout till last year since 
<br/>the Programme was introduced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2021-2022 Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $4 million was allocated for the First 
<br/>Home Grant, which was in July last year when we approved it, and this was paid out within the first 
<br/>few months of this financial year, assisting 213 Fijian households.  In fact, $410,000 was vired from 
<br/>the First Land Purchase Programme to meet the total payout of $4.3 million.  A total of 130 or 61 
<br/>percent  of  households  from  the  213,  received  their  grant  to  construct  their  first  home,  and  83 
<br/>households received their grant to purchase their first home.  A total of 145 households benefitted 
<br/>from the $50,000 and below income category, and the balance of 68 were in the high income bracket.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  although  the  funding  was  fully  utilised,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and 
<br/>Community Development continued to receive applications for the First Home Grant.  To meet this 
<br/>high demand, and I hope the honourable Members of the Opposition have picked this up, the Ministry 
<br/>has been allocated an additional $5.9 million in the Revised Budget, to be able to cater for those 
<br/>applicants who have actually been successfully processed through the banks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has received a further 243 applications.  From the 
<br/></span><span>243  applications,  nine  were  declined  as  they  did  not  meet  the  eligibility  criteria.    There  were  26 
<br/>incomplete  applications,  and  the  Ministry  is  currently  liaising  with  the  applicants  for  further 
<br/>information.    The  remaining  208  successful  applicants  will  receive  their  grant  payments  in  the 
<br/>coming weeks to a total payout of $4.6 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the really update regarding that.  As we have said, it is working out 
<br/>quite successfully.  Just as a matter of interest, it is one thing to give the grant but it is also important 
<br/>to  know  the  total  value  of  loans  they  took  out.    In  2020-2021  financial  year,  the  433  successful 
<br/>applicants were able to secure home loans to a total of $58 million.  In other words, the $58 million 
<br/>were actually lent by the banks under this scheme for them to buy or build their homes.  In the current 
<br/>financial year, home loans in access of $63 million have been secured to-date by the 421 applicants, 
<br/>over seven folds of economic activities compared to the total grant payout of $9 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it meant that as a result of $9 million grant by the Government, $63 
<br/>million was released into the economy by the banks and that, of course, has created economic activity 
<br/>in the construction sector, et cetera.  Of course, this means more employment opportunities and better 
<br/>roofs for ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.A.R.  SENILOLI.-  Mr.  Speaker,  a  supplementary  question;  can  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister inform Parliament as to why this grant is not available to those who wish to build a home 
<br/>in their village or on mataqali land when FNPF allows for such withdrawals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- They qualified under the Rural Housing Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.A.R. SENILOLI.- Can the Minister inform Parliament why this grant is not available 
<br/>to those who wish to build a home in the village or on </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land, whilst FNPF allows for such a 
<br/>purpose? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his question.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can provide him with further clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1009 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNPF does allow people to take out 50 percent of their eligibility funds to 
<br/>build on land on which they own as members of the landowning unit because they are a member of 
<br/>their landowning unit, so obviously no one can ever boot them out from there.  In the Vola Ni Kawa 
<br/>Bula (VKB), they are in that particular landowning unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, FNPF knows when they take out that 50 percent, that that money is not going to waste.  
<br/>That is why FNPF will never allow you to take out your 50 percent, if you are going to build a house 
<br/>on land that is not secure through title.  If you do not have a proper lease and no proper title, they 
<br/>will not allow you to take out the money.  But if you a member of the landowning unit and also in 
<br/>the VKB, no one can illegally boot you out of that land. So, that is why they will let you take out 
<br/>your money because that money is for you to build your home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular scheme, of course, the Honourable Member would know, that the banks are 
<br/>actually providing the bulk of the funds.  So, someone may come along and say, “I want to build a 
<br/>$150,000 home.” They have a proper title, whether it is freehold, whether iTaukei lease or whether 
<br/>it  is  Crown  lease.    The  bank  approves  that  because  they  obviously  have  to  have  a  job  to  do  the 
<br/>repayments.  The bank then provides the loan funding, they will apply to us also and we give $30,000 
<br/>towards their loan.  That is how it works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The bank takes a mortgage on that particular property. If that person cannot pay the fund, the 
<br/>bank can use that land which is as collateral, to be able to move in to do a mortgagee sale, in the 
<br/>worst case scenario.  Obviously, you cannot do a mortgagee sale on iTaukei land because you will 
<br/>never have to do a mortgagee sale on iTaukei land because the person will never leave that land and 
<br/>you take out 50 percent of your money from FNPF.  That is the difference.  Of course, as I have 
<br/>highlighted earlier on, we have the other housing scheme where we contribute $10,000 for people to 
<br/>be able to build their homes, should they want to access that particular fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- I do not understand how this scheme works.  We all understand that 
<br/>Civil Servants’ contracts is only up to five years maximum and to be renewed two years or three 
<br/>years but the policy of the banks in order to provide the loan, they need to secure the repayments of 
<br/>the loan.  They need to establish that the customer has to repay that loan within that period.   The 
<br/>financial institution will provide a 20 years term.  That is what I am saying.  I do not understand how 
<br/>the banks or financial institutions can lend money when the security of a job is only five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I do not know whether the Honourable has worked in the 
<br/>private sector or not, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but Honourable Gavoka should talk to him.  He has worked 
<br/>in the private sector, he never had a life term employment agreement, no one. Not even Shangri La 
<br/>gave him a life time work. Tourism Fiji did not give him….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- How did you know? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I know these things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  I  have  worked  in  the  private  sector  before.  Honourable 
<br/>Tanya Waqanika has worked at Fiji Revenue and Customs Service, she did not have a lifetime job.  
<br/>So, you worked at FDB, I understand, you did not have a lifetime job.  No one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, gets 
<br/>a  contract  for  a  lifetime.    Banks  know  that,  even  the  bank  CEO  get  contracts  for  three  years 
<br/>themselves  or  five  years  maximum.    They  still  go  and  borrow  money.  So,  it  is  a  fallacy,  it  is 
<br/>misrepresentation and maybe we can perhaps have a discussion afterwards.  Banks do lend money to 
<br/>people who have a job, contract for three years or for five years.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They give them a loan because they do know at that point in time, that you actually have a 
<br/>secure contract and the contract will also stipulate the manner in which it can get renewed but they 
<br/>also have at the same time a collateral, they have a mortgage over the property. In the event that you 
<br/>cannot pay, they give you time to pay and should you not pay within or go through a default period 
<br/>and then if they do not, then they can get their money back by getting the collateral. So, that is how 
<br/>it works.  No one in the private sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has a job for a lifetime - three-year contracts, 
<br/>five-year contracts and banks still lend them money.
