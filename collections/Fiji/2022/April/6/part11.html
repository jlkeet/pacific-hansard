<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Reserve Bank of Fiji 2018-2019,  
<br/>2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 
<br/>to  submit to  Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Reserve Bank of Fiji  2018-2019, 
<br/>2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports.  While the 2018-2019 period was business as usual for 
<br/>the RBF, the year 2020 brought its own unique challenges due to trade tension between the USA and 
<br/>China during the first half of the financial year and Fiji being hit by COVID-19 cases during  the

<div><span>second  half,  like  many  other  countries,  Fiji  too  had  to  face  the  brunt  of  the  pandemic  as  global 
<br/>economic  activities  had  dwindled  significantly.    Proactive  measures  were  taken  by  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government to avoid large-scale outbreak and with borders closing around the globe, the number of 
<br/>inbound  tourists  dropped  dramatically  which  led  to  the  negative  economic  ramifications  in  the 
<br/>country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While deliberating on the Report, the Committee noted the various policies that the Reserve 
<br/>Bank  of  Fiji  (RBF)  had  introduced  during  2019-2020  and  2020-2021  periods  to  mitigate  the 
<br/>economic impact of COVID-19 and commended the Bank for its swift action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the shift towards digital method of transactions which were triggered 
<br/>by COVID-19 restrictions, with more people using services such as M-PAiSA and internet banking.  
<br/>Fijians living abroad used mobile money services to  send money to  relatives living in  Fiji  which 
<br/>contributed towards the significant increase in remittances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Committee appreciates the shift towards cashless transactions, it also recommended 
<br/>for RBF to continue working with key stakeholders, such as the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), 
<br/>to strengthen its cyber security capabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  havoc  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  also  an  opportunity  to  explore  other 
<br/>prospects, one of it being the huge potential of business process outsourcing and the many benefits 
<br/>Fiji could gain with more international businesses outsourcing their services to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the Governor of the RBF 
<br/>and his team members for being prompt in answering the various queries and questions raised by the 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced this Report, namely: the Deputy Chairperson – honourable Veena Bhatnagar, honourable 
<br/>George Vegnathan, honourable Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Review of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>RBF 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.

<div><span>Review Report - Follow-Up Audit Report for High Risk Ministries and Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, the Committee Report follows the Report 
<br/>of  the  Auditor-General  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  on  the  Follow-up  Audit  Report  for  High-Risk 
<br/>Ministries and Departments.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Audit  Report  covers  the  outcome  of  the  follow-up  audits  of  audit  recommendations 
<br/>provided in the 2017 Audit of High-Risk Ministries and Departments. The follow-up audits were 
<br/>carried out during the audit of the 2017-2018 Agency Financial Statement.  The following reports 
<br/>and agencies were covered: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Audit Report on General Administration Sector 2017 </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 07 of 2019)</span><span>, 
<br/>covering Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management, 
<br/>Republic of Fiji Military Forces and Fiji Police Force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Audit  Report  on  Social  Services  Sector  2017  </span><span>(Parliamentary  Paper  No.  08  of  2019)</span><span>, 
<br/>covering  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Audit Report on the Economic Services Sector 2017 </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 09 of 2019)</span><span>, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covering the Ministry of Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Audit Report on Infrastructure Sector 2017 </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No.10 of 2019),</span><span> covering 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report examined the extent of implementation of the audit recommendations made on 
<br/>the  above-mentioned  Reports  with  responses  from  Ministries  and  Departments.  The  Committee 
<br/>noted  that  this  detailed  status  update  was  done  on  the  follow-up  audits  for  the  eight  high-risk 
<br/>agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that majority of the recommendations made in the 2017 reports for 
<br/>different agencies were yet to be fully implemented.  Only 39 percent of the recommendations were 
<br/>fully implemented, 27 percent were partially implemented and 34 percent were not implemented at 
<br/>all.    However,  after  the  Committee’s  consultations  with  the  eight  respective  Ministries  and 
<br/>Departments, it has been confirmed that these agencies have shown progress in their implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of the above, respective Ministries and Departments should take necessary action to 
<br/>fully implement the remaining recommendations.  There is a possibility that Permanent Secretaries 
<br/>of  some  agencies  have  not  been  largely  updated  on  the  status  of  the  implementations  of 
<br/>recommendations by their Accounting Heads as required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  the  implementation  rate  can  be  improved  if  recommendations 
<br/>made in these reports are implemented and outstanding audit reports are included in the agenda of all 
<br/>monthly meetings of the agencies.  This can be achieved by the formation of an audit committee by 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries.  The role of the audit committee should be extended to include findings for 
<br/></span><span>internal audits and matters relating to risk of agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were matters highlighted in the report by the Auditor-General that were not seriously 
<br/>considered by some Ministries in relation to audit recommendation implementation as reflected in 
<br/>the follow-up audit report.  This was a matter of concern by the Committee as the relevant Ministries 
<br/>and Department Heads need to prioritise and take necessary action where appropriate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Committee commends the effort of those Ministries and Departments that have 
<br/>progressively implemented the relevant recommendations.   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  acknowledge  the 
<br/>support from the Department that despite the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, the Committee met on 
<br/>a virtual platform to conduct its scrutiny process of the Audit Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I also wish to thank my fellow Committee Members, namely: honourable 
<br/>Alvick  Maharaj  -  Chairman,  honourable  Ro  Teimumu  Kepa,  honourable  Virendra  Lal  and 
<br/>honourable Aseri Radrodro, for their efforts and contributions in the final compilation of this Report. 
<br/>With those words, I now commend this Report to Parliament.</span><span>
