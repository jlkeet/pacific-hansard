<div><span>Cath Lab Equipment &amp; Angiogram – CWM Hospital 
<br/>(Question No. 61/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- My question is to the honourable Minister for Health and 
<br/>Medical Services and with your approval, Mr. Speaker, to save me from having to stand up on a Point 
<br/>of Order during the reply, if I could just ask the honourable Minister to, please, follow Standing Order 
<br/>45(4) where it says that the Minister must reply to a question, a reply must be relevant, concise and 
<br/>confined to the subject matter, so that we are not getting a ministerial statement for oral questions.  
<br/>My question, therefore, is ….    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you do not put any conditions into your questions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You ask the question and the Speaker will take it on from there. No conditions!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament of 
<br/>the reasons that led to the malfunction and in-operational status of the Cath Lab equipment 
<br/>and Angiogram at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  that 
<br/>question.    As  we  speak,  the  Catheterization  Laboratory  that  we  have  is  working  very  well  at  the 
<br/>Colonial War Memorial (CWM) Hospital.  Not only is it working very well, it is also serving and 
<br/>looking after our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Catheterization Laboratory was installed in 2009 and i2010 and this was through 
<br/>a collaboration between Dr. Vijay Kapadia and his group, the Rotary Club, and also the group in 
<br/>Australia, who had a vested interest in the training of our staff.   So, that Catheterization Laboratory 
<br/>served us well throughout that time and was also involved in the training of our three Cardiologists, 
<br/>including our two Intensive Interventional Cardiologists that we now have.  During that period of 
<br/>training, the team will come from overseas and when they come, then the Catheterization Laboratory 
<br/>could open and work because they have to train under supervision.  It was not available all the time, 
<br/>it was only available during the time that our team came. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2020,  the  machines  started  having  some  issues  and  problems  and  working  with  our 
<br/>biomedical technicians and Mr. Peter Koern, who was our biomedical engineer, initially with Philips 
<br/>but now doing his own consulting after retiring from Philips.  He worked with us and remotely, we 
<br/>were able to fix issues as we went along.  Unfortunately, we reached a stage where we could not fix 
<br/>it anymore and discussions were done on being able to bring forward the current machine that we 
<br/>now have and is working at the CWM Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2009 and 2010, the Catheterization Laboratory at CWM Hospital was the 
<br/>only one in the country.  Throughout that period, with the tax incentives that have been put in place
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>969 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the support to the private hospitals, we now have a Catheterization Laboratory also available in 
<br/>Oceania  and  also  Heart  International  which  we  must  also  commend  because  Heart  International 
<br/>consists of a group of Fijians from New Zealand, who also have a vested interest in our country and 
<br/>they have set up a Catheterization Laboratory in the West. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have also done during the period that in between the last one to two years when we 
<br/>have had some times when the Catheterization Laboratory was not working, those patients we were 
<br/>able to pick up from the system and we were able to support them, depending on the threshold in 
<br/>terms of their salaries, as we do with any other cases that we send overseas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have to realise that the Catheterization Laboratory has gone from a 
<br/>training Catheterization Laboratory for Angiograms to now our fully qualified Cardiologists who are 
<br/>able to do interventional cardiology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  forward,  what  we  intend  to  do  and  what  the  Fijian  Government  and  also  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy has alluded to is that, we have Health Care (Fiji) which is coming 
<br/>online and they will be offering cardiovascular services, including cardiology services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have begun discussions and we have put it as a policy in the Budget that we would 
<br/></span><span>like to outsource some of the interventional and also diagnostic work that is being done within the 
<br/>public hospital system.  What we will do is a few things, it means that we are able to have this, that 
<br/>we can actually look towards and go and utilise outside, but we can also ask them for a standard of 
<br/>care and also ensure that the biomedical equipment has a service contract and fixed on a regular basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister; can he update Parliament in terms of rebooking patients who were supposed to 
<br/>undergo  Angiogram  or  attend  Catheterization  Laboratory  procedures,  what  is  the  process  now  in 
<br/>following up and rebooking of patients to undergo the services that is now available?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that 
<br/>question.  As I have alluded to earlier, we now have three areas in which cardiology service such as 
<br/>Catheterization Laboratory is available and those are at the public system, in Oceania and also in the 
<br/>Heart International. If you are booking patients and I presume that the honourable Member is asking 
<br/>the question whether it is a public patient or a private patient, because we also have a private practice. 
<br/>So in the private practice, as you are aware, those patients can either be referred to us or referred into 
<br/>the private system. The system is through the Fiji College of General Practitioners (FCGP) and also 
<br/>the links that we have with Oceania through FCGP to Heart International.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With our system, the referral is the same.  That comes through and it is triaged by Dr. Bharat, 
<br/>Dr. Sahin and Dr. Sukapa and if it is coming from Taveuni, for example, then they will state a date 
<br/>in which the person can come in and also receive their care. During the tea break, I was able to go up 
<br/>and within that period from the morning till about 10.30 a.m. when I was there, they had done three 
<br/>cases already. So, certainly they are rolling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  important  thing  is,  and  we  must  congratulate  the  team  and  the  Government  for 
<br/>supporting this,  is  that we have cardiology services  at  that level  available now on a regular basis 
<br/>rather  than  waiting  for  the  team  to  come  from  overseas.    Honourable  Dr.  Lalabalavu  would 
<br/>understand that in the interim period, they had to wait until the team comes to able to do interventional 
<br/>cardiology services, but that is now available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Really, when we talk to them, there are three types of patients that they have. There are those 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  A  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Minister;  can  he 
<br/>enlighten the House on what the Ministry has considered as a backup service for the Catheterization 
<br/>Laboratory and Angiogram in case there is a malfunction in the future? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  even  with  the  last  Catheretization 
<br/>Laboratory, we had considered that and that is why we had the backup in Australia. As I have alluded 
<br/>to  in  my  previous  reply  to  honourable  Qereqeretabua,  the  discussions  were  being  held  by  the 
<br/>biomedical  engineer  in  Australia  with  our  technicians  here  remotely,  albeit  remotely  had  some 
<br/>challenges.    They  sent  across  a  computer  that  was  different  but  again,  now  that  the  borders  are 
<br/>opened, the ability to travel is actually much simpler.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Budget - Benefits to Rural &amp; Maritime Teachers 
<br/> (Question No. 62/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SIGARARA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Local 
<br/>Government inform Parliament on how rural and maritime teachers will benefit from the 
<br/>Revised 2021-2022 Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  
<br/>While the Government provides Free Education Grant, Transport Assistance and Free Textbooks, it 
<br/>is  also  our  responsibility  to  ensure  that  students  in  remote,  rural  and  maritime  schools  are  not 
<br/>disadvantaged in terms of accessing qualified teachers for quality education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we see it necessary to support school management in their efforts to provide 
<br/>teachers with quarters.  This, in turn, ensures that teachers are comfortable and are able to provide 
<br/>better support to our students.  School quarters and now with the reinstatement of rural allowance, 
<br/>both these two things being put in place will assist the Ministry to attract teachers to serve in the rural 
<br/>and maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is doing what it can to provide support to our teachers to go to these remote and 
<br/>maritime areas to teach our students by assisting with their accommodation. Our teachers are our 
<br/>assets and we want to do whatever we can to make their lives comfortable in their job.  In the Revised 
<br/>2021-2022 Budget, the Ministry of Education received a funding of $1.3 million for the building and 
<br/>maintenance of teachers’ quarters in 10 schools. These include schools in the Ra, Ba, Tavua, Lautoka, 
<br/>Nadi, Yasawa, Nadroga/Navosa, Macuata, Bua, Lomaiviti, Koro, Lau, Kadavu and Nausori Districts.  
<br/>It includes the renovation and construction of approximately 40 teachers’ quarters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last seven years, the Ministry has spent around $4.4 million to upgrade 
<br/>teachers’ quarters for 187 schools around the country through its building grant allocation.  After </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span>, schools that were rebuilt included teachers quarters and some of those quarters were built 
<br/>mostly as duplexes and triplexes, just to increase the number of teachers’ quarters in the rural areas. 
<br/>For example, at St. Teresa School, we have built teachers’ quarters which are duplexes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Australian  Government  has  provided  around  AU$12.5  million  to 
<br/>rehabilitate nine schools in the North that were damaged by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.  In this programme, they will 
<br/>also refurbish and rebuild teachers’ quarters in these schools.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>971 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while teachers’ quarters belong to the communities and the responsibility 
<br/>to  maintain  quarters  is  with  them,  the  Ministry  has  been  encouraging  School  Management 
<br/>Committees  to  rent  quarters  to  teachers  and  use  the  rent  to  maintain  the  quarters  and  wherever 
<br/>possible, the Ministry is also rebuilding and renovating these quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  teachers  in  the  rural  areas,  particularly  in  the  maritime  areas,  are  quite 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>excited about the new Revised Budget with the reinstatement of rural allowance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  provision  of  proper  housing  quarters  and  the 
<br/>reinstatement  of  rural  allowance  in  the  Revised  Budget  will  greatly  benefit  our  teachers  in  the 
<br/>maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  intrigued  by  the  words  of  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister saying “reinstatement”.  Apparently, this allowance was paid way back in the time of Ratu 
<br/>Mara.  Why did you stop it? Now, you are wanting to bring it back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  honourable  Member  was  also  in 
<br/>Parliament  when  the  honourable  Attorney-General  presented  the  Revised  Budget  and  because  of 
<br/></span><span>COVID this rural allowance was held back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Ministry for the work that it is 
<br/>doing, especially in the renovation of quarters, but as far as the allowance is concerned, when will 
<br/>this be implemented? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The announcement  was already made by the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and we all sit in Parliament. The problem is, we are not listening carefully. The allowance 
<br/>comes into place from 1st April.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Education Management Information System – Status of SLA 
<br/>(Question No. 63/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the status 
<br/>of the Service Level Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding with the Information, 
<br/>Technology  and  Computing  Services  (ITC)  regarding  the  Fiji  Education  Management 
<br/>Information System? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the honourable Member’s 
<br/>question is premised on the Auditor-General’s Report.  That is where he is coming from without, of 
<br/>course, fully understanding and reading the Report.  What is really interesting and, again, this is what 
<br/>we are talking about the incompetency in the Office of the Auditor-General.  It says, and I would like 
<br/>to read the extract: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“MEHA stated that a SLA is ideal and the MEHA IT Department will liaise with 
<br/>ITCS to  draw up an SLA.  However, one of the disadvantages of SLAs could  be that 
<br/>sometimes  it  can  make  service  worse  because  they  can  let  the  provider  take  the  full 
<br/>amount  of  time  specified  in  the  SLA.    If  the  provider  is  allowed  three  days  to  fix 
<br/>something  that  takes  five  minutes,  then  the  provider  will  probably  take  three  days.  
<br/>Attention needs to be given to non-compliance and how will this be captured in the SLA. 
<br/>Given that there is no contractual relationship between MEHA and ITC except that they 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are  both  part  of  the  same  government  machinery  and  the  ITCS  responsibilities  are 
<br/>mandated through the legislations, it may be difficult to put in place an SLA.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, having observed all of that, the Auditor-General’s Office, in their wisdom, comes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up and says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“MEHA in consultation with ITCS should consider having a SLA or MOU on the 
<br/>type  of  services  that  would  be  provided  by  ITCS  and  what  would  be  MEHA’s 
<br/>responsibilities.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  honourable  Member,  in  your  quick  win  to  try  and  score  some  points,  you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overlooked and did not read the Report itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Lands pays the lease in their allocation for all the land that 
<br/>Government leases from the iTaukei Land Trust Board.  There are different Ministries, but we do not 
<br/>have an SLA between Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Rural Development, where they may have 
<br/>some Government stations.  They do not have an SLA between themselves.  We have the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy paying all the rental for all the Government Offices we rent.  They do not have an SLA 
<br/></span><span>between them, it is part of Government, so obviously we do not need an SLA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament does ITC have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an MOU or an SLA in place with other Government Ministries?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already answered the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Investments in Rural Areas  
<br/>(Question No. 64/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural 
<br/>and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  inform  Parliament  how 
<br/>Government investments in the rural areas since 2018 have improved living standards 
<br/>in rural and maritime communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>this question, which I have a great pleasure in presenting to this august House on how Government’s 
<br/>investments  have  improved  the  standard  of  living  in  the  rural  areas  around  Fiji.    Government  is 
<br/>committed to rural development as it is a key national priority.  This is an inspiration outlined in the 
<br/>20-Year National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our commitment is built on the foundation that the development of our rural areas is a solid 
<br/>measure of the progress of the nation, and Government is fully aware that investment, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in rural infrastructure is critically important to foster Fiji’s economic development and prosperity. 
<br/>This  will also  contribute to  higher productivity and growth,  facilitates trade and connectivity and 
<br/>promotes economic inclusion.  In fact, the social and economic development of rural communities is 
<br/>integral to the wellbeing of any society and the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Honourable Minister for Education has touched briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on some of the 
<br/>initiatives  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  covering  under  their  allocation,  but  I  will  speak 
<br/>specifically on a few areas, mainly rural water, rural electrification, rural infrastructure and, of course, 
<br/>a few of the programmes that are allocated to the Ministry for Rural Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>973 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  provides  allocation  to  various  Government  Ministries  to 
<br/>implement capital projects and services.  In recent years, we have witnessed substantial Government 
<br/>investment  in  the development of rural  infrastructure, provision  of  education and health services, 
<br/>rural  electrification,  access  to  water,  income-generating  opportunities,  better  communication  and 
<br/>transportation infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last two weeks, I have been visiting communities in the Northern 
<br/>and Western Divisions and before that, I was also in the Eastern Division, in the islands of Ovalau, 
<br/>Moturiki and, of course, Kadavu.  We were commissioning some of the Government-funded projects 
<br/>that were implemented by my Ministry.  But I am pleased to note the scale of new developments 
<br/>implemented  recently,  not  only  rural  development  allocation  but  projects  that  were  given  to  the 
<br/>Ministry of Rural Development but, of course, with the other key stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will begin with water, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Water is a basic necessity in life and Government 
<br/>is  committed  to  improve  the  access  of  our  rural  communities  to  safe  drinking  water  in  adequate 
<br/>quantities.  One thing that I wish to mention here, and it is also the same with rural electrification, 
<br/>we are, sort of, into the second cycle of development, meaning some of the water projects that were 
<br/>done  previously  are  no  longer  meeting  the  demands  because  demands  have  increased  in  some 
<br/></span><span>communities.    The  same  thing  applies  with  electrification,  some  were  given  diesel  generators  in 
<br/></span><span>previous years but now, most of them want the EFL grid because of the extension by Government 
<br/>and,  of  course,  we  are  going  clean  and  most  are  into  solar  as  well.    So,  this  is  the  new  cycle  of 
<br/>development that is happening in the rural areas which is encouraging to see, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On water, as I have stated, new projects particularly for catchments, for those that have water 
<br/>directly from source, then boreholes and, of course, there are places and I will not go into the list, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  who are  asking for ecological  purification systems  so that  they  can have better 
<br/>quality drinking water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $1.25 million has been allocated to the Ministry in the last two 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financial years to address a higher priority Water and Sanitation Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on rural health centres and nursing stations, we have also seen upgrading in 
<br/>subdivisional hospitals to provide access to basic healthcare and medication, and the children in rural 
<br/>and maritime areas in general have good access to health facilities.  Of course, the same applies to 
<br/>education, for their transportation with the subsidised allocation given from the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  on  infrastructure,  Government  is  committed  to  restoring,  upgrading  and  building  new 
<br/>roads,  bridges  and  jetties  through  its  Rural  Roads  Programme.    Investment  in  roads  alone  has 
<br/>increased from $26 million in 2015 to $39 million in 2018 respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last three financial years since 2018, a total of $76 million was allocated towards the 
<br/>jetty  replacement  programme  and  upgrading  of  rural  roads.    In  addition  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>Government invested around $6.9 million during the same period on Shipping Franchise Schemes, 
<br/>which is in line with the Northern Development Programme (NDP) goal of ensuring safe, efficient, 
<br/>reliable and affordable shipping services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Rural  electrification,  Government  has  progressively  invested  in  this 
<br/>Programme through grid extensions and the installation of solar home systems.  And for some of 
<br/>these grid extensions, the Rural Electrification Team and EFL are in the final process of finalising 
<br/>the connections, particularly with the inspections from EFL so that the communities that have already 
<br/>been wired will get their connections to the EFL grid.  For that, in the last three years, Government 
<br/>has spent about $34.4 million on rural electrification projects.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  some  of  the  projects  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  I  have  been 
<br/>commissioning  a  lot  of  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths,  and  Footbridges  (CARFF)  related 
<br/>projects.  Across the four Divisions, about $4.4 million was allocated in the last few years, benefitting 
<br/>more than 200 communities.  These projects have made accessibility easier and improved access to 
<br/>essential services for about 41,000 Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  name  a  few,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Nakida  Village  Access  Road,  they  have  never  had 
<br/>roading before and that will benefit the community.  That came at a cost of around $47,000 for the 
<br/>initial access that has been cut. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  in  Ra  last  week,  the  Nalaba  District  School  serving  the  </span><span>Tikina</span><span>  of 
<br/>Nalaba and Tokaimalo, their access road, because the carrier was not willing to take the students 
<br/>directly to the school because of the state of the road, so we fixed that for the community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Self-Help Programme, we are now focusing not only on social projects but more on the 
<br/>livelihood  approach  as  well  on  the  income  generating  projects  as  a  means  of  empowering  rural 
<br/>communities.  Women’s groups, Mr. Speaker, Sir, having solar freezers, canteens, some farmers get 
<br/>their animal sheds, so those are examples of income generating projects and we are shifting slowly 
<br/></span><span>from the usual social projects into empowering rural communities.  Of course, this also supports the 
<br/></span><span>basic needs of life, including access to water, communication and transportation in the social aspect 
<br/>of the projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Government’s major investments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have highlighted a few but for water 
<br/>and sanitation, we continue to construct and upgrade water projects which allows communities to 
<br/>access safe drinking water in their homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had mentioned  rural roads, it underpins the ability for the communities to 
<br/>access services, such as health, education, water, et cetera, as well as the franchise shipping services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May, I also add that Government in terms of its decentralisation and empowerment and taking 
<br/>services closer to the rural people, have also constructed DOs  or Government Stations in some of 
<br/>the areas, particularly for the services of the DOs and the Assistant DOs Mr. Speaker, Sir.  To name 
<br/>a few in the West, we are just in the process of completing Namarai in Ra and hopefully, that facility 
<br/>will be commissioned soon.  The same in the North, Sir, Kubulau in Bua is operating, likewise Lekutu 
<br/>in Bua, and there is a new DO stationed now in Wainikoro, Macuata.  In the Eastern Division, Nasau 
<br/>in Koro, Qarani in  Gau and, of course, Kavala in Kadavu.  These are new projects that will help 
<br/>improve services and, of course, access to it as well by the rural communities.  In the Central Division, 
<br/>we have also constructed a DO’s post Dada, Namosi, Sir.  So, these are the many projects that will 
<br/>bring a lot of benefits to our rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister.  According 
<br/>to the Household Survey Report of 2019-2020, our poverty rate was 36 percent and 74 percent of 
<br/>these  are  rural  dwellers.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  enlighten  the  House  about  what  type  of 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation is done to ensure the effectiveness and success of these investments in 
<br/>rural areas?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, each agency that is involved in rural 
<br/>development  have  their  own  monitoring  systems  as  well  and  for  us  in  the  Ministry  of  Rural 
<br/>Development, this is something that we take seriously and, of course, we are also reviewing policies 
<br/>in the Ministry particularly in trying to elevate those recipients from their current status.   We are 
<br/>calling it an incubation period of say the first five years for all project recipients, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>975 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what we are looking into in the Ministry of Rural Development so that we continue 
<br/>to  have  effective  monitoring.    With  that  as  well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  talked  about  income-
<br/>generating projects.  One of the things that we are demanding from the recipients now is for them to 
<br/>have bank accounts and not only that but if they can have savings and of course possibility of having 
<br/>investments as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it is quite encouraging.  Even in some of the projects 
<br/>when it comes to monitoring particularly those by IHRDP, some projects have issues, probably with 
<br/>previous managements but the good thing is, they still have money in their savings accounts.  So I 
<br/>wish to assure this august Parliament that we take monitoring seriously and it will show its impact 
<br/>definitely in the years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>answers that he gave for the substantive question.  I just want to ask the honourable Minister, how 
<br/>can his Ministry assist rural-based communities that have independent water sources, who have to 
<br/>relocate  their  catchment  areas  or  the  dam  themselves  because  traditional  communities  actually 
<br/>encroach into the catchment area for their own  survival  because they do not  have leases to  these 
<br/>catchment areas?  For example, WAF, to retain their catchment area would have to take an exclusive 
<br/></span><span>lease of the area to protect it but rural communities use the same land for their own survival, therefore, 
<br/></span><span>sometimes it becomes untenable, so what kind of assistance can you offer them?  I know there is a 
<br/>whole lot of communities where the catchment areas have actually been intruded into, so how can 
<br/>you, perhaps some funding or how can your Ministry help in that regard to these communities?  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT. COL.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first,  we also have the  rural  water 
<br/>component with the Ministry of Infrastructure.  Rural communities are advised if they can have their 
<br/>local water committees to look into their issues.  Development is taking place at a very fast rate in 
<br/>rural  areas, particularly  with  agriculture and the  expansion of agriculture, livestock, or  even with 
<br/>crops and these threaten some of the water sources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are few categories of water sourcing in Fiji.  One is directly from the streams and dams 
<br/>are constructed.  These are the communities that probably the honourable Member is referring to.  
<br/>For these communities, I have talked about ensuring that they have quality drinking water because it 
<br/>is coming directly from the source, it goes directly into the tap as well.  So that is where the ecological 
<br/>purification system comes in to.  There are a lot of these cases all over Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first thing that the Government does whether it is the Ministry of Infrastructure, through 
<br/>the Rural Water Team or in the consultations with the Ministry of Rural Development, the first thing 
<br/>is  to  identify  an  alternative  source  within  the  area  because  particularly,  when  landowners  are 
<br/>involved,  we  have  to  have  the  consent  as  well,  ensuring  that  all  the  requirements  are  met  before 
<br/>Government can put the infrastructure in place.  So the first option will always be for an alternative 
<br/>source.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That alternative source must not only serve the needs now, but one thing that learning from 
<br/>the past as well based on the trend in the rural communities as well, population particularly.  I must 
<br/>here acknowledge all the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> and the </span><span>mata ni tikina</span><span> because right now in the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural Development, working together with the iTaukei Affairs, we have the profile of almost every 
<br/>village in Fiji; their water sources, type of houses, type of energy is provided to the village and their 
<br/>sanitation issues.  It is a big improvement from where we started off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we have this information, we are able to plan in advance on the requirements of the 
<br/>area.  One thing that Government is seriously looking into now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not only this 
<br/>specific community but the wider area.  For example, I have talked a lot about Namara and Verata, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they have water issues and the Water Authority piping is quite a distance away.  We are now working 
<br/>together with Water Authority of Fiji to identify a source that not only will cater for Naiborebore or 
<br/>Tobuniqio, but it is the wider community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a strategic approach rather than just reacting to the needs of one community only.  This 
<br/>is one thing that we are doing.  Otherwise, borehole is the other alternative or rainwater harvesting.  
<br/>Those are the two other alternatives that we have for these communities.  So direct source from the 
<br/>dams  or  boreholes  or  rainwater  harvesting.    Rainwater  harvesting  is  vulnerable  as  well  because 
<br/>dependent on the weather because it is Tailevu, no problem, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition Security 
<br/>(Question No. 65/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A. LALABALAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment update 
<br/>Parliament on the status of the Food and Nutrition Security and the Fiji Plan of Action for 
<br/>Food and Nutrition Security? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Member for asking 
<br/>this question.  When we talk about food security, there are two key aspects, one is accessibility and 
<br/>affordability.  Within this framework of accessibility and affordability, I am going to explain to this 
<br/>Parliament about what we are doing in terms of ensuring that we do have food security for Fijians in 
<br/>the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Food and Nutrition Security for all Fijians is one of the key strategic 
<br/>priorities in the Ministry’s 2019 and 2023 Strategic Development Plan as well as Fiji’s 5-Year and 
<br/>20-Year National Development Plan. So, the entire activities that we undertake basically emanates 
<br/>from this overall framework – The Strategic Development Framework for the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>and Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year Development Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  guiding  strategy  is  the  basis  of  the  related  policies  and  initiatives 
<br/>formulated during the course of our 5-Year Plan to develop and boost the achievement of at least 
<br/>food security for all Fijians.  Furthermore, the Ministry is also working with the other line ministries, 
<br/>for example, the Ministry of Health in ensuring that we are able to guarantee as far as possible food 
<br/>and nutrition security for all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last two years, we have several policies, activities and programmes 
<br/>that was implemented to achieve food security. Two key notable programmes over the last two years 
<br/>that we undertook was the Home Gardening Programme and the Farmers Support Package. When 
<br/>you talk about accessibility, then the accessibility will happen when we have production and supply 
<br/>distributed throughout Fiji. When you have production and supply, let say in Taveuni, Kadavu and 
<br/>Cicia, then it is  accessible. But when  you talk about affordability then the only way to  guarantee 
<br/>affordability is to have sufficient supply on the ground. The temporary issues about increasing wages 
<br/>and salaries, price-cap, et cetera is not a sustainable solution to deal with the issue of affordability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When there is a temporary price hike due to COVID-19, flooding or a cyclone, there had been 
<br/>calls  made  to  the  Ministry  thinking  that  the  Ministry  can  set  price  caps.  But  neither  do  we  have 
<br/>powers to do that nor it being a sustainable solution to deal with an issue that is temporary. I always 
<br/>believed that to deal with a temporary measure, we should not have policies to deal with a temporary 
<br/>measure.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  strategy  is  to  ensure  that  we  work  on  the  ground  to  deal  with 
<br/>production and supply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>977 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two programmes that we introduced at the beginning of 2020, we had 
<br/>228,744 home  gardening  seed packs, which had  $1.1 million  individual seeds packs  given out  to 
<br/>households throughout Fiji. That programme is still being implemented where households were able 
<br/>to grow their own food. There is an amazing mobilisation of households throughout Fiji in terms of 
<br/>growing their own food. The dust has not settled yet with the crisis between Ukraine and Russia and 
<br/>the increasing shipping freight cost. We have not put our guards down, we are on the ground ensuring 
<br/>that we continue to get people motivated in terms of growing their food as far as possible and as 
<br/>much as possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, we were also able to mobilize the farmers who were able to grow and expand 
<br/>production  for  their  own  household  income  as  well  as  national  interest  and  there  is  a  substantial 
<br/>growth in the agricultural  output which fed the entire nation and in  addition to  that, were able to 
<br/>export in surplus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total agriculture grew at an annual average growth rate of 3.2 percent 
<br/>from  2016-2020.    In  addition,  agricultural  production  also  grew  at  an  average  growth  rate  of  3.6 
<br/>percent from 2016 to 2019.  The latest GDP Release still notes that there is a major positive growth 
<br/>in agriculture, despite a decline in the other sectors of the economy.  Of course, one would say that 
<br/></span><span>it is a temporary measure because these people moved back to agriculture and they have come back.  
<br/></span><span>But we have got new land under production that shows that agriculture is here to stay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in nominal terms, when you are talking about the value of agriculture, at 
<br/>the moment, it is $1.5 billion but our target over the next 10 years from last year, we want to get 
<br/>agriculture to have a value of $2 billion.  Having said that, the question that arises is, what do you do 
<br/>with the surplus, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  In 2020, the agricultural exports - fresh and chilled was $106 
<br/>million.  The latest figure for 2021 shows that the agricultural exports - fresh and chilled after feeding 
<br/>the entire nation, has gone up to $121 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  leading  the  charge  in  exports  is  </span><span>kava</span><span>  which  is  around  $40  million;  $30 
<br/>million - </span><span>dalo</span><span> (fresh and chilled); $21 million - turmeric (a new crop on the board) and over the last 
<br/>three years, has surpassed the other traditional export crops; and ginger at $21 million; we have got 
<br/>eggs being exported to Pacific Island countries.  So all these have pushed exports to $121 million in 
<br/>2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only that, Mr. Speaker, we have also identified, given food security issue, strategic crops 
<br/>(staple food crop) that we need to grow if we have a strategic advantage within.  Rice, for example, 
<br/>we  are  spending  about  $42  million  every  year.    There  is  a  major  boost  in  rice  production  in  the 
<br/>Northern Division, as well as in the Western Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  last  two  years,  we  have  raised  self-sufficiency  in  rice  from  16 
<br/>percent  to  20  percent  and  my  feeling  is,  it  could  be  22  percent,  if  we  account  for  this  year’s 
<br/>production.  There is substantial savings in the money that we are losing, which we are gaining from 
<br/>export of traditional crops, tourism, remittances, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, pushing production on the ground, ensuring this is accessible, 
<br/>ensuring this is in the volume that will reduce prices and make it affordable, is the long term strategy 
<br/>to ensure and guarantee food security for ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; we have just heard about 
<br/>the  many  programmes  and  policies  that  have  been  introduced  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  to 
<br/>ensure accessibility and affordability of good nutrition to the people.  Can the honourable Minister 
<br/>enlighten the House on four key result areas that have made their programmes a success or failure?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>978 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am currently baffled that they do not listen to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our responses and asking about the four key result areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, the prices of agricultural output in the markets and on the roadside 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stalls will demonstrate to you whether it is affordable or not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second is the supply issue. If you go and ask people whether they are able to get vegetables 
<br/>that they consume daily and if they are not able to get them, then there are food security issues, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third is the data. The data that I am presenting in terms of production, I am saying that while 
<br/>all the other sectors have declined or 13 percent declined, agricultural output has increased over the 
<br/>last  two  years.    The  RBF  and  the  Bureau  of  Statistics  data  shows  that  agricultural  outputs  have 
<br/>increased, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that surplus where exports have gone up, from 2022, we have gone 
<br/>up to $106 million, in 2021, $121 million. What other data or evidence would you want us to show 
<br/>that our food security are under control?  And not only that, we are exporting the excess after feeding 
<br/></span><span>the entire nation, to get that much needed foreign currency into the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Impact of Natural Disasters - Groundwater Usage and Consumption 
<br/>(Question No. 66/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources inform Parliament on the impact of recent cyclones and other natural 
<br/>disasters on groundwater usage and consumption? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Geological Services Division of the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands, in particular the Mineral Resources Department (MRD), has the responsibility of looking after 
<br/>groundwater assessment, investigation to confirm boreholes that might provide water and also do 
<br/>groundwater drilling and reticulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can confirm that a lot of boreholes were affected by the cyclones, in particular  </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>
<br/>which hit us in December 2020, which is the second strongest cyclone to hit Fiji, and also </span><span>TC Cody</span><span>
<br/>in January 2021.  It affected the whole number of boreholes and examples of these included the 10 
<br/>Villages in the Kubulau District of Bua.  Also, there are about nine communities around Labasa and 
<br/>another seven communities in the wider Macuata Province.  It was good in a sense that the damage 
<br/>was mostly done to the infrastructural equipment - solar panels, associated electrical systems, water 
<br/>storage tanks, pump house and also the distribution pipes that reticulated water to the various houses 
<br/>that are hooked up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of our concerns was that the cyclones and the saltwater intrusion would actually affect 
<br/>the aquifers, but the good thing to note is that it did not affect the aquifer, so the Ministry then had 
<br/>to focus on just fixing the infrastructure around the boreholes.  Because of the severe impact of the 
<br/>tropical cyclones, the MRD put together a quick response and recovery team with technical expertise 
<br/>in equipment and responded to damage assessments and restoration works from December 2020 to 
<br/>January  2021.    But  since  2015,  the  Ministry  has  assisted  around  47  communities  by  providing 
<br/>groundwater  supply  systems  to  supplement  the  existing  water  systems,  whether  this  is  rainwater 
<br/>harvesting, or whether it is actually surface water systems that they already have.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>979 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  technical  team  continues  to  design  and  develop  water  supply  systems  that  should 
<br/>withstand the impacts of tropical cyclones.  The cost of restoration work was about $400,000 and 
<br/>this included the drilling of two boreholes for Yaro Village on Kia Island, which was one of the most 
<br/>heavily affected communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.  LAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question;  can the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inform Parliament what assessment does MRD do to ensure borehole water quality is appropriate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of things MRD does in order to make sure 
<br/>that the quality of the water and the capacity of the water is in accordance with what we need for 
<br/>human consumption.  Over the years since it has operated, it has developed a number of Standard 
<br/>Operating Procedures, developed on the basis of what they have done in the past, so this is aligned 
<br/>to the minimal acceptable standards of water well drilling globally.  So it involves making the best 
<br/>use of materials and the right materials, because we have found that sometimes if the wrong materials 
<br/>are used, then the borehole itself gets contaminated, and that is something we have seen over time.  
<br/>There is a heavy emphasis on using scientific methods and equipment in determining the potential 
<br/>for groundwater development and also in implementing test to determine the capacity of an aquifer 
<br/>or the amount of water that is in an aquifer to release the groundwater from storage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also carries out community consultations and engagements before and after each 
<br/>phase of the groundwater, to ensure that the needs of the communities are met and various issues 
<br/>relating to access to safe and water source are considered and recorded.  For instance, the issue that 
<br/>was raised by the Honourable Tikoduadua, when you have surface water making sure that people do 
<br/>not  intrude  in  your  water  catchment  area,  the  same  sort  of  things  are  done  with  respect  to 
<br/>groundwater. In this way, groundwater users are empowered. They give the knowledge and skills so 
<br/>that  they  can  work  in  partnership  with  the  Ministry  in  making  sure  that  groundwater  is  made 
<br/>available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I have just said here that the Ministry also tries to make sure that we do 
<br/>not over extract from any borehole because if you do that, you will get dirty water or the borehole 
<br/>dries up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also conducts annual monitoring of all the boreholes drilled by Government and 
<br/>installed with water reticulation systems.  If we do find that some boreholes are not producing water 
<br/>that is of good quality for people to drink, that borehole is flushed and sanitised and if the aquifer or 
<br/>borehole is still heavily contaminated, then the borehole is decommissioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Rasova, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister, can he 
<br/>inform Parliament how can the Government better assist companies that are involved in the extraction 
<br/>and export of groundwater, considering the amount of money received from exports? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I did not fully grasp the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament how can 
<br/>the Government better assist companies that are involved in extraction and export of groundwater, 
<br/>considering the amount of money received from its exports?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had the occasion of working with companies 
<br/>that are interested in extracting groundwater. Our MRD has helped them out in trying to get the land 
<br/>where is needed and also checking to make sure that there is water where they need to extract that 
<br/>particular water.  So, that sort of thing is done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the concerns that we have at the moment is to try to get a firm grip on the amount of 
<br/>water  that  we  have  in  our  aquifers.  One  of  the  concerns  that  we  have  in  the  future  that  it  is 
<br/>theoretically possible for us to over extract water from our aquifers.  So, this is one of the things that 
<br/>we are developing at the moment, trying to get a firm grip on how much water is there.  Water in our 
<br/>aquifers comes from rainwater.  So you have to look at the amount of replenishment that is going 
<br/>into  the  aquifers  and  look  at  that  in  relation  to  the  extraction.  So,  this  is  a  process  that  is  being 
<br/>undertaken now by the MRD because water is a vital resource.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know that there are countries in the world now that fight over water, so this is one of the 
<br/>things that we are looking at. We do help out these organisations, but as much as possible over the 
<br/>long term, we want to make sure that we do not over extract because our people and our country can 
<br/>be affected.

<div><span>Social Welfare Recipients Insurance Eligibility- Fiji Care Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 67/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  eligibility  requirements  of  the  insurance  scheme  for  social  welfare 
<br/>recipients through Fiji Care Limited? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for the question with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a smile, of course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2018-2019,  the  Fijian  Government  in  partnership  with  the  Fiji  Care 
<br/>Insurance Limited, introduced the Micro Bundle Insurance for all Civil Servants and Social Welfare 
<br/>recipients, a first initiative for the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The insurance cover included; life, funeral, fire and personal injuries, and a total of around 
<br/>11,000 beneficiaries were initially covered with a total cover of $10,000 which included; $3,000 for 
<br/>Life; $1,000 for Funeral Expenses; $3,000 for Fire; and $3,000 for Personal Injuries.  This cover was 
<br/>provided as an annual premium of initially $70, which is now $65 just for social welfare recipients.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since its inception, Fiji Care Limited has paid out $21 million in claims to 16,690 
<br/>insured people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of social welfare recipients, the question is, what is the eligibility?  Of course, you 
<br/>have to be a social welfare recipient and you have to be a recipient of one of the four Social Protection 
<br/>Programmes  that  we  have,  that  is,  Poverty  Benefit  Scheme,  Care  and  Protection  Scheme,  Social 
<br/>Pension Scheme and Disability Allowances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To date we have 86,000 people under these four Social Protection Programmes and all of 
<br/>them are covered.  Since November last year, one of the criteria to be eligible for this Fiji Care Micro 
<br/>Bundle Insurance Scheme was that you have to be vaccinated.  I am proud to say that most of our 
<br/>social welfare recipients complied with that and of course had access to the insurance payout. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from funeral expenses that is covered by this insurance, the Ministry also has fire  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>981 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assistance to non-recipients.  So, if you are a non-recipient, not covered by the Fiji Care Insurance, 
<br/>the Ministry has a budgetary allocation where upon the receipt of the fire report and the police report, 
<br/>we pay out $1,000 immediately for emergency supplies to fire victims.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Scheme  is  reviewed  annually  and  of  course  the  government  will 
<br/>continue to pay the premium so that we are sort of expanding our financial security net  for these 
<br/>welfare recipients and we will continue with this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a Scheme that has benefited over 16,000 of our social welfare recipients and apart 
<br/>from  this  Scheme,  of  course,  the  Social  Protection  Programmes  assist  people  in  terms  of  food 
<br/>vouchers and monthly allowance.  Of course, this includes the disability and social pension scheme 
<br/>where the age limit is now 65 years.  So, if you are over 65 years of age, you qualify for the Social 
<br/>Pension Scheme per month which is $100 per month.  Never before!  So, this is a Government that 
<br/>has put in place this initiative to protect our poor and the vulnerable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Rosy 
<br/>Akbar.    Can  the  Minister  inform  Parliament  why  those  who  passed  away  without  receiving  the 
<br/>COVID-19 vaccine, their relatives are not eligible to benefit from the insurance paid in their relatives 
<br/></span><span>name under the Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.S.  AKBAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  already  said  that.    One  of  the  conditions  of  the 
<br/>insurance scheme is that you have to be vaccinated.  If you did not comply with that requirement, 
<br/>obviously, you will not receive the payout. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to ask a supplementary question regarding 
<br/>this Scheme.  Has a cost benefit analysis been done?  The reason I am asking is thatf, from the figures 
<br/>she gave - 86,000 recipients, $65 per recipient as premium, that comes to $5.5 million and the payout 
<br/>for beneficiaries has been $23 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- $21 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- $21 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The question is, has a cost benefit analysis been done on this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme in terms of premiums being paid and the benefits? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.S.  AKBAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please  allow  me,  I  do  not  understand  what  your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>problem is.  Are you against us helping our vulnerable? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- It is just a cost benefit analysis.  The cost of …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see a lot of benefits for the social welfare recipients,

<div><span>Easing of Inflationary Pressures from Food &amp; Fuel Prices 
<br/>(Question No. 68/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on measures 
<br/>that  the  Fijian  Government  has  adopted  to  ease  inflationary  pressures  emanating  from 
<br/></span><span>rising international food and fuel prices? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for his question.  Sir, as mentioned yesterday in response to one of the other questions, we 
<br/>all know the inflationary pressure in fact has been rising globally, in particular, the second half of 
<br/>2021 due to high import price and freight costs.  The entire world is actually facing global supply 
<br/>chain disruptions pent-up demand, in fact, there has been now, is outpacing supply itself with supply 
<br/>chains further affected by the Ukraine and Russian war.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Crude oil prices, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are currently hovering over US$100 a barrel and wheat 
<br/>and other commodity prices have been rising rapidly.  Domestic prices, Mr. Speaker, have also risen 
<br/>in recent months reflecting international price developments.  Annual inflation stood at 4.7 percent 
<br/>in March 2022.  As mentioned yesterday also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expect price rises to actually 
<br/>continue due to global food and fuel supply disruptions exacerbated by the war.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in countries like USA, inflation rate is now 7.9 percent, 
<br/>India is 6.07 percent, New Zealand is 5.9 percent, UK is 5.5 percent, Singapore is 4.3 percent and 
<br/>Australia is 3.5 percent.  These go back to December and January, February of this year.  Mauritius, 
<br/>a country like ours, a tourism-driven country, the inflation rate there as of February this year is 9 
<br/>percent.  Of course, Samoa is 4.5 percent as of January 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what have we done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is precisely the reason why we have also 
<br/>carried out various revisions to the 2021-2022 Budget.  As highlighted, we have reduced or zero-
<br/>rated VAT on 21 household items.  Just to reiterate – sugar, flour, rice, dhal, tea, potatoes, onions, 
<br/>garlic, canned fish,  cooking oil, salt, liquid  milk,  powdered milk,  baby milk,  sanitary pads, soap, 
<br/>bathing soap, soap powder, toilet paper, tooth paste, cooking gas and kerosene.  Of course, this will 
<br/>mean Government forego $163 million, Sir.  However, of course, we see there is a benefit for the 
<br/>overall population in Fiji too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International  crude  oil  prices  have  increased  to  US$100  a  barrel  as  stated  earlier  on.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to mitigate against these rising fuel prices, we have removed the 20 cents levy per litre 
<br/>of fuel, a duty that we had, we had introduced earlier on.  As a result of this, Government will lose 
<br/>out about $56 million in direct collections.  Again, this is to help ordinary Fijians, businesses, carrier 
<br/>drivers, bus companies, mini bus companies, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>983 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  highlighted  also  the  other  day,  the  price  of  fertiliser  is  skyrocketing.  
<br/>Countries like Ukraine and Russia, they make a lot of urea and potassium, et cetera that goes into the 
<br/>fertiliser mix.  China and Russia combined together, we are told, produces about 90 percent of the 
<br/>entire world fertiliser production and of course as a result of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen 
<br/>prices increased quite substantially.  International sanctions on Belarus also propelled spot prices on 
<br/>GMO fertiliser or muriate of potash to almost double and, of course, shipping rates has exponentially 
<br/>grown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to put it into context, Sir, prior to COVID, a bag of fertiliser that Government used to 
<br/>subsidise was $45.65.  A sugarcane farmer paid $20, Government paid $25. 65.  Before the Ukraine 
<br/>war actually broke, Sir, we received the figures and we have to input it into the Budget that it will 
<br/>rise to $80 or to $90 a bag.  So essentially the sugarcane farmer will still pay $20, Government will 
<br/>have to, if it goes to $80, we would be lucky if it goes to $80 and not more than that, will have to pay 
<br/>$60 a bag.  That is how much it has increased, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Obviously, we will be bearing the 
<br/>burden  for  that  and  we  have  allocated  an  additional  $9.7  million  through  the  Ministry  of  Sugar 
<br/>Industry under the Fertilizer Subsidy Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Electricity Fiji Limited (EFL), we are continuing with our 50 percent 
<br/></span><span>subsidy.  We had in fact made it a 100 percent with some collaboration with EFL, but now goes back 
<br/></span><span>to 50 percent of the bill as allocated in the Budget.  Sir, we have allocated $13.2 million in the Revised 
<br/>Budget.  It will assist domestic customers, with a combined annual income of less than $30,000 per 
<br/>household for the first 100 kilowatt of electricity consumption.  Currently, under the Scheme, about 
<br/>58,192 customers are benefitting from this. Some, of course, some more can apply too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the honourable Members seem to forget what is actually in the Budget, but we 
<br/>had also announced last year and which is continuing is that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>(MSMEs) where they are now paying domestic rates.  We are actually subsidising the difference 
<br/>between the domestic rate and the commercial rate which they used to pay with an annual turnover 
<br/>of $1.25 million or less and we are covering the first 1,000 units of electricity consumed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  extending  under  the  Revised  Budget,  we  have  extended  this 
<br/>programme  now  to  July  2022  with  an  allocation  of  $2  million.    Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as 
<br/>highlighted  in  the  Budget,  and  as  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation also highlighted, we are also paying a one-off $50 to all social welfare recipients in the 
<br/>Revised Budget, you will see that in SEG 50 - $7 million has been allocated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have allocated $13 million as a $100 one-off payment to all those 
<br/>in the informal sector in Vanua Levu because they had not received anything during the past two 
<br/>years.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about 34,385 WAF customers will continue to get their water 
<br/>subsidy which we provide for those households earning less than $30,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  major  announcement  of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  taking  into  account  on  what  has 
<br/>happened  globally  and  following the undertaking by  Government  in  2018 that we will revise the 
<br/>National Minimum Wage every two years.  Some politicians, I think the </span><span>paapi</span><span> lot have said that we 
<br/>should have revised it two years ago in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously, it is quite silly to suggest we should have reviewed the wages in 
<br/>2020 when over 100,000 Fijians lost their jobs. You could not do a review when 100,000 people have 
<br/>lost  their  jobs  and  do  a  minimum  wage  review  then.    Of  course  the  borders  have  opened  up, 
<br/>honourable Gavoka seems to be shaking his head.  Obviously he does not understand this at all, nor 
<br/>does  he  appreciate  it.    If  he  had  appreciated  it,  he  actually  would  be  applauding  this  initiative, 
<br/>honourable Gavoka.  Unfortunately, you need to look within to find out the solutions.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Minimum  Wage  has  been  reviewed.    I  have  to  remind 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament again, because they tend to forget, it was the Bainimarama-led 
<br/>Government that introduced the National Minimum Wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- There was never a National Minimum Wage.  It was only 
<br/>the  ten  Wages  Sector  that  had  their  own  minimum  wage,  the  Bainimarama-led  Government 
<br/>introduced it at $2 and I hope just to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to say this because they need 
<br/>to be schooled on these matters that National Minimum Wage means that you cannot pay anyone 
<br/>below this particular rate irrespective of what job they do, whether they come and cut grass at your 
<br/>house, or dig a hole for foundation or any job they do, you cannot pay below the National Minimum 
<br/>Wage.  The other ten Wages Sectors have their own minimum wage which is a lot higher than the 
<br/>National Minimum Wage.  So, it was $2 in 2014, the review was done in 2013, it went up to $2.32 
<br/>an hour, then it went up to $2.68 an hour in 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, of course Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the assistance of Dr. Partha,  we have now said that 
<br/>the minimum wage will be increased to $4 an hour but we are doing it responsibly, not for political 
<br/></span><span>stunting like they want to do.  We have done it in four stages because we have to be considerate, we 
<br/></span><span>do not want people to lose their jobs.  If tomorrow someone is paying $3 or $2.68 an hour, you cannot 
<br/>expect them to overnight pay immediately $4.  In this way, we will be able to make sure the jobs are 
<br/>still maintained and then we will  be able to meet the rise in cost of the inflationary impact that has 
<br/>been brought about by the pandemic and of course the war in Ukraine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, we have provided the unemployment support in respect of how 
<br/>we would people meet their cost of living in respect of this inflationary impact. We have already 
<br/>disbursed $205 million to top up members’ balance to the FNPF system and, of course, the rounds 
<br/>of the $360 and $50, and the two rounds of and the $90 - a whopping payout of $225 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, we have seen a huge consumption increase during the times when 
<br/>those payments were made out, and again we see a particular level of confidence that are coming 
<br/>back to the consumers - psychological and it is also real. On the ground, if you go out and look at 
<br/>retail stores, you will see a lot consumption taking place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  that  respect,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  to  ensure  that  we  continue  down  this  path,    as 
<br/>already been announced, and should there be any dramatic changes within the global economy, we 
<br/>as  a  Government  will  always  maintain  that  flexible  position  to  be  able  to  respond  to  any  of  the 
<br/>inflationary matters, should they get out of hand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- May I suggest going forward, we remove the Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the Order paper, Mr. Speaker? We are getting it everyday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable member, ask your question, if you have a question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last few days, Mr. Speaker, a litre of unleaded fuel has gone up to $2.77 and that is 
<br/>when one barrel of oil is pegged at about US$100.  The honourable Minister has said that it might go 
<br/>up to US$300.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I didn’t say $300.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>985 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- He said that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that happens, Mr. Speaker, a litre of unleaded fuel can go up to $8.31, or even $10. Now, 
<br/>that will cripple this country. Is the Government planning for an eventuality such as this, because the 
<br/>way things are going, this war and the ramifications elsewhere will bring about this thing wasting, 
<br/>and Government appears to be asleep – sleeping on the job? They need to be showing us their plan, 
<br/>in the event things get worse than what we have today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  and  for  those  who  wish  to  ask  supplementary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>questions, ask your supplementary question, but do not make a statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  would  appear  that  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member’s disruption with his own Party is disorientating him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already answered this question yesterday. He had asked a similar 
<br/>question yesterday about what is going to happen in the future.  I never said the price of a barrel of 
<br/>fuel will go up to US$300 a barrel.  I never mentioned that, please, check the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.  Please, 
<br/>do not misrepresent what I had said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did say that the prices can actually go up. Yesterday, when he asked 
<br/>whether we have any reserves or we can keep any reserves, we did also say in that context that the 
<br/>Americans are thinking of releasing some of their oil reserves. If they do, do that, then it will reduce 
<br/>the pressure on the global fuel price. There is a lot of geopolitics that goes along with it because if 
<br/>they release their reserves, Sir, then it could mean the price will come down but, of course, other 
<br/>countries may benefit from it if they do not want.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said yesterday and I have also said just now, Mr. Speaker, that we will maintain a 
<br/>flexible position. We have already said that, and we have shown that through our policies that we 
<br/>have a very flexible position in being able to meet the inflationary impact, whether it has a detriment 
<br/>on our economy or not, that is something that we will deal with. We cannot look into the future and 
<br/>say, “Exactly, this is what is going to happen." And that is a sign of a good government - it does not 
<br/>commit to something that he cannot actually put his finger on, but maintains a particular level of 
<br/>flexibility to be able to deal with a situation as and when it occurs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Attorney-General for his contribution to the debate. 
<br/>Honourable members, Oral Questions is now over, but before we move on, I would like to take this 
<br/>opportunity to acknowledge and welcome to the House, the Non-Resident Ambassador for the State
