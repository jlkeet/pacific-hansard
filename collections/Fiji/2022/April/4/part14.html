<h3>CUSTOMS TARIFF (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>CUSTOMS TARIFF (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Customs Tariff (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 be considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament today, Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022, and 
<br/>that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, similar to the previous motion, Sir, this is, 
<br/>again,  in  relation  to  the  1,500  codes  that  were  changed,  two  codes  under  this  particular  Act  of 
<br/>overriding law was, in fact, incorrectly referenced.  One of them is related to the gas stoves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Customs Tariff Code for gas stoves under this particular Act was incorrectly referenced 
<br/>as  highlighted  earlier  on,  7323.81.00  which  should  have  been  referenced  as  7321.81.00,  and  the 
<br/>reference to the concession code for the Fijian Drua was incorrectly referenced as 237, which should 
<br/>have been referenced as 307. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implications, of course, as we have said, the idea is to have the import 
<br/>VAT on 15 percent for gas stoves.  Having 237, Sir, for the Fijian Drua as opposed to 307 would 
<br/>create  confusion  because  we  actually  have  a  237  for  approved  companies  for  international  cable 
<br/>laying maintenance.  This was already in existence before the Revised Budget Amendment Act, the 
<br/>sharing of one code for two different  categories will, of course, create confusion and give rise to 
<br/>uncertainty, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted earlier on, we take responsibility for this.  The 
<br/>Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS), unfortunately, gave us the wrong code number but we still

<div><span>take  responsibility  for  it  and  ask  Parliament  to  approve  this,  to  give  the  effect  to  the  policy 
<br/>announcements in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/>the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover.  Any Member wishing to take 
<br/>the floor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As there is no one wishing to take the floor, honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing further to add.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  there  being  opposition  to  the motion,  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will now vote.

<br/></span><span>- 
<br/>- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you now have the Bills with you.  We will go through the process of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debate after we have had morning tea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, it might have surprised you today about the Bills being presented but it is the right of 
<br/>Government to make corrections as soon as it is possible and if the House is sitting at that time, it 
<br/>does  it  at  the  first  opportunity  and  this  is  the  first  opportunity  for  that.    We  had  already  made 
<br/>arrangements for todayâ€™s sitting but once those Bills came in and the request that it should be done, 
<br/>my  Office  and  the  Secretariat  accommodates  that  request  to  make  the  correction  at  the  first 
<br/>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have done that.  That was why there was a delay in the start of Parliament today which I 
<br/>apologise  for,  but  sometimes  you  have  to  make  the  adjustments  when  it  is  necessary  and  it  was 
<br/>necessary today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, on that note, we will take a break not for half-hour but for about one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hour so you can, at the same time, consider the Bills that are before you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Take your seat!  Do not get up when I am speaking, honourable Whip of the Opposition.  Just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remember that!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  we  have  one  hour  break  and  then  we  will  resume  debate  on  the  Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Whip, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Just a point of clarification, 
<br/>for our information.  I just want to confirm whether we are discussing the Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/>for one hour straight after this, if that could be clarified?

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will take the morning tea break, you have the time.  We are still dealing 
<br/>with these two Bills.  That is the process that we will follow, unless no one wants to take morning 
<br/>tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, honourable Members, we will break for morning tea.
