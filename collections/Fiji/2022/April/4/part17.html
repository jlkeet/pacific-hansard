<div><span>Participation of Serving Inmates in Sports Tournaments 
<br/> (Question No. 51/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament of the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service policy that permits a serving inmate to participate in a national rugby 
<br/>sevens tournament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in the Business Committee, there is no such thing as a policy 
<br/></span><span>when it comes to Government regarding the running of the Corrections Service, nor is there a policy 
<br/></span><span>by the Commissioner of Corrections.  He cannot run policies, he actually goes by the law and I would 
<br/>have thought that the honourable Member would have actually looked at the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the Corrections Service Act 2006, Sir, and I would like to take the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member through the Act itself Sir.  It says in section 5(1), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “The Head of the Fiji Corrections Service shall be the Commissioner of Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service, who shall - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subject  to  the  orders  and  directions  of  the  Minister,  have  the  administrative 
<br/>command and direction of all officers of the Corrections Service in accordance 
<br/>with the provision of this Act; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the purpose of exercising any of the powers provided by this Act, have the 
<br/>power to make Orders for observance by corrections officers and prisoners, which 
<br/>shall be known as “Commissioners Orders”; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>have the control of all prisoners and may allocate them to such prisons as he or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>she sees fit; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>have the power to designate, from time to time, the classification, purpose and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>function of any prison; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span> </span><span>have  the  power  to  make  delegations  of  the  Commissioner’s  authority  to  any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>officer by written instrument of delegation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It, of course, goes on further to talk about the officers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  law  also  states  that  under  the  regulation  itself,  there  are  various 
<br/>provisions pertaining to what the Commissioner of Corrections can actually do.  “The Commissioner, 
<br/>of course, shall have the power to review all proceedings heard by any supervisor or senior officer 
<br/>under this regulations,” in other words, should there be a hearing. they do have to conduct internal 
<br/>hearings within the prison itself.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Schemes for Early Release which the Commissioner 
<br/>of Corrections  can do, for example, in  addition  to  any requirement  for  eligibility of early  release 
<br/>provided for in the Act, a prisoner may meet the following criteria to be considered for early release 
<br/>-   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>A prisoner must have a record of good behaviour and prison work;   
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>The prisoner must demonstrate a desire and ability to return to the community as a law 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>abiding citizen;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>The prisoner should have availed himself or herself opportunities offered during the 
<br/>term of imprisonment, aimed at rehabilitation and equipping the prisoner for productive 
<br/>life upon their release. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, of course, we have schemes for short term release.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further on, as provided for in the law and as you can see I am reading from 
<br/>the Laws of Fiji, we have what we call Prison Rehabilitation Objective.  We have programmes in 
<br/>prison to allow rehabilitative environment.  It says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Programmes in Prison to Allow Rehabilitative Environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The prison environment should – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>encourage positive changes and behaviour and attitude; 
<br/>provide good social examples 
<br/>challenge offending behaviour and promote self-esteem;   
<br/>encourage prisoners to take responsibility for their actions; and  
<br/>promote prisoner self-control.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  prisoner  classification  must  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissioner Order No. 011, which states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Upon  admission,  each  prisoner  must  be  assessed  for  programme  needs  with 
<br/>particular  regard  to  the  offence  committed  and  regularly  assessed  through  their 
<br/>classification  process,  all  sentenced  prisoners  must  be  provided  with  the  opportunity  to 
<br/>participate in programmes including drug and alcohol, parenting, personal hygiene, sports 
<br/>and recreation and spiritual development.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  does  also  say  that  the  Commissioner  of  Prisons  under  these  orders, 
<br/>therefore,  can allow the prisoners to participate in sporting activities too.  These are all provided for, 
<br/>and I would like to highlight to the honourable Member, under the orders that is actually stipulated 
<br/>in the Act.  It is all available there, and I urge the honourable Member to read the actual law itself 
<br/>where these guidelines, of course, cannot be breached but are actually adhered to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, it does go on to also say that the prisoners can participate, the 
<br/>Commissioner of Prisons can also reach out, for example, to members in the community, the </span><span>turaga 
<br/></span><span>ni koro</span><span>, et cetera, to see how people can fit in when they want to come back to the community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have prisoners, for example, who choose to go out and do cane cutting, Sir.  As we have 
<br/>seen, we also have, for example, Ms. Jane Ricketts who has done a wonderful work where they have 
<br/>an art gallery in Korovou.  They go out and do art paintings, they intermingle with the cruise liners 
<br/></span><span>that used to come, they used to mix around with the tourists that used to come who buy their paintings, 
<br/></span><span>et cetera, and so there are a number of schemes that are available.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>949 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Sir, in schemes for short-term release, it does also say, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Commissioner may approve the short-term release of a prisoner into the care 
<br/>and supervision of traditional chiefs and other community leaders upon being satisfied 
<br/>that –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The traditional chiefs or community leaders are willing to assume responsibility over 
<br/>the care and supervision of the prisoner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>The traditional chiefs or community leaders are capable of making a contribution to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rehabilitation of the prisoner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Any condition imposed by the Commissioner of Prisons in relation to the release of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prisoner shall be complied with.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Yellow Ribbon Programme and also with the orders that has been 
<br/>put in the </span><span>Gazette</span><span>, we have seen that the rate of recidivism in Fiji dropped tremendously.  At one 
<br/>point in time, the rate of recidivism in Fiji was 50 percent, a few years back.  In other words, the 
<br/>prisoners, people who went to prison, 50 percent of them used to go back.  It was like a revolving 
<br/>door.  That is what used to happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember very clearly, Sir because of the lack of these types of rehabilitative functions and, 
<br/>indeed,  policies  through  the  orders  implemented  through  the  Corrections  Service,  the  rate  of 
<br/>recidivism is very high.  I have the rate of recidivism with me, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2009, it was 7.9 percent; 2010 – 5.91 percent; 2011 – 3.0 percent; 2012 – 6.34 percent; 
<br/>2013 – 5.7 percent; 2014 – 3.56 percent; and 2015 – 5.19 percent.   From the new financial year, 
<br/>August 2016 to July 2017 – 4.78 percent.  The following year, it was 1.5 percent, then 2.5 percent, 
<br/>1.7 percent, 1.06 percent currently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this essentially indicates that the combination of ensuring that people who 
<br/>are  to  serve  their  sentences  are  actually  serving  their  sentences,  in  conjunction  with  the  Yellow 
<br/>Ribbon Programme, together with the various orders of the Commissioner of Corrections andit is 
<br/>working well in a holistic manner, to ensure that the rate of recidivism drops in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Personally, Sir, I have been to workshops being held at the ANZ National Stadium where 
<br/>they  actually  invited  employers  and  you  had  all  these  prisoners  who  actually  had  different  trade 
<br/>skillsets and over there in that particular meeting, people were actually given jobs.  So, people coming 
<br/>out knew that they actually had a job.  The Commissioner of Corrections knew that this person could 
<br/>actually  be  released  into  the  community  and  we  have  seen  many  of  them,  of  course,  a  huge 
<br/>percentage, never coming back to the prison system.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a bit of additional information for the honourable Member because I think she is, kind 
<br/>of, very mono-focussed.  The point of the matter, Sir, is that, the powers exist within the Corrections 
<br/>Act itself, powers exist within the subsidiary legislation for the Commissioner of Corrections to be 
<br/>able to carry out these sorts of measures where he or she believes that whoever is the commissioner, 
<br/>that the rehabilitation of prisoner can actually take place.  Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Mr. Speaker, arising from that, can the Commissioner of Prisons 
<br/>allow his discretion under the Yellow Ribbon, for example, to permit a talented player to represent 
<br/>his division or the country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not get the question. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Can the Commissioner of Corrections Service allow his discretion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the Yellow Ribbon to permit a talented player to represent Fiji or his province? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, we do not make those decisions.  As 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlighted, I would like to read it, again.  It says here, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Upon  admission,  each  prisoner  must  be  assessed  for  programme  needs  with 
<br/>particular  regards  to  the  offence  committed  and  regularly  assessed  through  the 
<br/>classification process.  All sentenced prisoners must be provided with the opportunity to 
<br/>participate in programmes including drug and alcohol, parenting, personal hygiene, sports 
<br/>and recreation and spiritual development.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, that assessment, Sir, is built upon the Commissioner of Corrections Service’ team, 
<br/>the Commissioner of Corrections himself, and also his team would provide that assessment.  It goes 
<br/>on further to say and in the interest of time, I refer the honourable Members to page 527,001 of the 
<br/>Laws of Fiji where it does say also in terms of building up the capacity of individual prisoners, and 
<br/>I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Organised  sports  builds  positive  self-regard  and  fosters  positive  self-esteem,  a 
<br/></span><span>healthier  lifestyle  and  teaches  social  values  such  as  sportsmanship,  participation, 
<br/>teamwork, cooperation, respect, discipline and goodwill.  All sentenced prisoners are to 
<br/>be permitted and encouraged to participate in and an organised sport/sports and recreation 
<br/>indoors every now and then. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  officer-in-charge  on  the  approval  of  the  Commissioner  and  with  conditions 
<br/>may allow for a prisoner to take part in competitive sports outside the prison.  Upon the 
<br/>completion  of  the  prisoner’s  participation  in  such  sports,  the  officer-in-charge  must 
<br/>ensure  that  a  written  report  of  the  prisoners’  participation  is  forwarded  to  the 
<br/>Commissioner and a copy of which is kept in the prisoner’s file.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is all there, please read the Laws of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  has  gone 
<br/>around and around in trying to justify this, but the women of Fiji are looking keenly on this issue and 
<br/>section 54(e) of the Corrections Service Act makes the Minister responsible for prescribing the rights 
<br/>of prisoners while in custody.  And I just think that given who the prisoner is, I know the honourable 
<br/>Minister talked about the Yellow Ribbon which is not what we are talking about here today, but it is 
<br/>about giving special treatment to someone because of who he is while he is a serving prisoner.  The 
<br/>women of Fiji would really love to hear from the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no question there.  I am beholden 
<br/>to the law, so she has cited section 54 (e), it states and describes the rights of prisoners whilst in 
<br/>custody.  It says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Regulations  Commissioner’s  orders,  et  cetera,  the  Minister  may  make 
<br/>regulations to give effect to the provisions of this Act and in particular in relation to 
<br/>regulation of governing prisoners, et cetera.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It then states in (e), which she read out, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Prescribing rights of prisoners while in custody, including matters related to 
<br/>visits from friends, relatives and other prescribed persons, communications by post or 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>other  prescribed  means,  procedures  for  complaint  and  representation  to  prison 
<br/>authorities,  the  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination  Commission  and  the 
<br/>Accountability and Transparency Commission, exercise and recreation and any other 
<br/>rights applying to prisoners awaiting trial.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These relates to the rights of the prisoners, so I cannot understand what she is going on about, 
<br/>maybe someone just text that particular clause to her which if does not understand what she is talking 
<br/>about.  This relates to the rights of the prisoners, so I cannot understand how that can be juxtaposed 
<br/>with her earlier representation about the specific question she asked.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>African Swine Fever 
<br/>(Question No. 52/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment inform 
<br/>Parliament on the precautionary and mitigation measures taken by the Ministry to prevent 
<br/>the introduction of the African Swine Fever to our shores? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Member for asking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the African Swine Fever is a highly contagious viral disease that affects and 
<br/>kills wild and domesticated pigs. The disease is transmitted through direct contact with infected pigs, 
<br/>indirect contact through ingestion of contaminated material, that is, food waste, feed or garbage, et 
<br/>cetera,  and  contaminated  fomites.  It  is  not  a  direct  risk  to  human  health,  but  it  causes  severe 
<br/>production  and  economic  losses  and  poses  a  significant  threat  to  the  pork  industry  in  Fiji,  as  its 
<br/>mortality rate can reach up to hundred percent and wipe out the entire industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, the African Swine Fever is not in Fiji. The disease was mostly present in 
<br/>African  and  European  continents  in  early  2000  but  by  August  2018,  China  had  reported  its  first 
<br/>outbreak and since then, the disease has spread to Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, 
<br/>Malaysia, Indonesia and Timor-Leste, all in the span of two years. The African Swine Fever has now 
<br/>spread  to  the  Pacific  where  PNG  reported  its  first  outbreak  in  March  2020.  There  is  no  known 
<br/>treatment and vaccination for this disease.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF) is the custodian of the Biosecurity Act 
<br/>2008 and thus,  has the mandate to  protect  Fiji’s borders against exotic diseases that would affect 
<br/>plants and animals’ health status.  In collaboration with BAF, in 2019, Fiji banned the importation of 
<br/>pork and pork products for personal consumption - individuals bringing in meat products, so that has 
<br/>been banned. At the moment, we are importing pork and pork products from only two countries  - 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand, and those two countries have no known cases of African Swine Fever 
<br/>uptil now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  that  stance,  we  are  not  allowing  anyone  to  bring  in  pork  meat  for 
<br/>personal consumption, for commercial use only from Australia and New Zealand and those certified 
<br/>companies approved by BAF following certain protocols. Again, Australia and New Zealand does 
<br/>not have any African Swine Fever.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  having  said  that,  we  are  not  taking  any  chances  and,  therefore,  we  are 
<br/>undertaking various trainings of our own staff and commercial farmers, should there be a case of

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outbreak, should there be a slip, on how do we handle, manage and cordon off those areas to ensure 
<br/>that there is no spread, while we deal with that particular area or farm where that fever is found.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November 2020, BAF signed the MOU with Pacific Horticultural and 
<br/>Agricultural  Market  Access  Plus  (PHAMA  Plus)  Programme,  supported  by  the  Government  of 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand, to support Fiji’s preparedness in case of an occurrence of the African 
<br/>Swine Fever.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  this  project,  BAF  in  collaboration  with  MOA,  conducted  trainings  and  awareness 
<br/>sessions for over 300 staff in both organisations and in all three Divisions - Central, Western and 
<br/>Northern.    Sessions  include  field  trainings  on  biosecurity  issues  and  diseases  surveillance.    So 
<br/>basically two aspects, one is, what are some of the key indicators or symptoms that we need to keep 
<br/>a  look  out  in  case  we  find  something,  immediately  whom  to  call  and  how  do  we  continue  the 
<br/>surveillance? These were the trainings that were undertaken by BAF in collaboration with PHAMA 
<br/>Plus with the Ministry, our staff and the commercial farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also keeping a watch on those additional importers who are given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>licence, to ensure that we have an  input in that and that they are on top of this particular aspect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, what I intend to do now is to take a break for lunch. 
<br/>We will continue with Questions after the lunch break. Lunch is served in the Big Committee Room 
<br/>and we will resume at 2.30 p.m. We break for lunch.

<div><span>Status of McGusty Building – Lautoka Hospital 
<br/>(Question No. 53/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the status of the damaged McGusty Building at the Lautoka Hospital? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  McGusty  Block  was  part  of  the  old  hospital  and  in  1970,  the  United 
<br/>Kingdom Government gifted Fiji the new Lautoka Hospital, which was opened in 1974.  Since then, 
<br/>the McGusty Block had been used as an accommodation for our staff, predominantly, the doctors 
<br/>and allied health staff, whereas the nurses continued to stay within the Nurses Building.  Then it was 
<br/>requested by the Fiji School of Medicine, initially the sixth year students used that and in 2000, they 
<br/></span><span>were able to build their own Block and they moved down again, and that was then used again by our 
<br/></span><span>staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2012, we had </span><span>TC Evans</span><span> and that damaged McGusty Block.  It was repaired by the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services in 2012 and used again as an accommodation until 2016 when we 
<br/>had </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and other cyclones, the integrity of the building came into question, so that was then 
<br/>not used any more.  As we all know, the Health Care Fiji is now going through the motions in terms 
<br/>of taking over and looking after both, Ba and Lautoka Hospitals, and this is now within their domain, 
<br/>which includes the old and not used McGusty Building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  supplementary  question  is  to  do  with  the 
<br/>Amnesty International’s 2021 to 2022 State of the World’s Human Rights Report that reported that 
<br/>our healthcare systems have inadequate resources.  That is why I am asking if the honourable Minister 
<br/>can update Parliament on how the McGusty Building can contribute to that in terms  of providing 
<br/>resources for the healthcare facilities?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  that  is  a  very  itchy  question,  but  I  will  let  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services handle that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Sir, I have just stated that McGusty Building has structural 
<br/>integrities and that is why it is not being used. We will not allow patients or staff to walk inside that 
<br/>building because of structural integrities. The question is completely different.

<div><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   With the additional budgetary allocation of $1.7 million to increase the salaries of 
<br/>teachers  who  have  upgraded  their  qualifications,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education, Heritage and Arts,  and  Local  Government inform  Parliament which subject-
<br/>area  teachers  upgraded  their  qualification  and  how  will  this  enhance  the  delivery  of 
<br/>education in Fiji?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  education  is  a  sector  that  is  continuously  changing,  just  like  any  other 
<br/>professional field.  For the education sector to remain relevant, it is critical that teachers upgrade their 
<br/>qualifications and continuously engage in professional development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a total of 12,872 teaching staff employed by the Ministry of which, 478 teachers 
<br/>have Master’s Degree; 1,107 teachers have Post-graduate level qualifications; 5,105 teachers have 
<br/>Degree; 4,304 have Diploma; and 1,878 have Certificates.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, teachers continue to 
<br/>study part-time to upgrade their qualifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  current  financial  year,  a  total  of  626  teachers  upgraded  their  qualification  who  will 
<br/>receive  salary  based  on  the  Teacher  Remuneration  Setting  Policy.  Of  these,  109  teachers  have 
<br/>upgraded from  Certificate to  Diploma, 63 teachers from  Certificate to  Degree, 434 teachers from 
<br/>Diploma  to  Degree  and  20  teachers  who  had  only  Bachelor’s  Degree  without  teacher  training 
<br/>qualification, have now become qualified teachers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the current financial year, the Ministry was allocated $911,000 to upgrade salaries of 279 
<br/></span><span>teachers which was already done.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Revised Budget, the Ministry received a 
<br/></span><span>further $1.7 million to upgrade the salaries of remaining 347 teachers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is pleasing to note that we have teachers in the rural and maritime areas 
<br/>upgrading their qualification, which gives us the reassurance that we are increasing the number of 
<br/>qualified teachers.  It simply means that in addition to providing Free Education Grant to all schools 
<br/>equitably, we are also building teacher capacity to provide quality education to our students.  Sir, 230 
<br/>teachers upgraded their qualification from remote and rural areas, 35 from maritime areas and 361 
<br/>from urban areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, teachers’ qualifications are in various subject areas -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>

<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>123 teachers obtained Bachelor of Education  (Secondary Education); 
<br/>337 with Bachelor of Education (Primary Education); 
<br/>37 teachers with Bachelor’s Degree; 
<br/>105 teachers with Diploma graduated with Early Childhood Education, an area where we 
<br/>need more teachers; 
<br/>4 with Diploma in Special Education; 
<br/></span><span>11 with Graduate Certificate in Education; and  
<br/></span><span>9 graduated with Graduate Diploma in Teaching. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bachelor of Education (Secondary) qualification include various subject combination.  
<br/>However, there are four teachers with Maths and Physics, one with Maths and Information System, 
<br/>four  in  Industrial  Arts  and  three  in  Computing  Information  System  combination.   We  need  more 
<br/>qualified teachers to teach these subjects because of teacher shortages in this area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are acute shortages of primary school teachers and I am pleased to 
<br/></span><span>inform Parliament that in this financial year, 337 in-service teachers have completed their Degrees 
<br/></span><span>in  Primary  Education.    We  all  understand  that  it  is  not  easy  to  work  full-time  and  study,  while 
<br/>committing to family and other obligations.  I, therefore, commend the teachers who are making a 
<br/>lot of sacrifices to upgrade their qualification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I apologise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I need to say this, again, in this House and also through the 
<br/>media, unions and Oppositions have been harping on why the Government is strongly advocating 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>955 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that teachers need to upgrade their qualification.  In fact, FTU and FTA were disappointed when we 
<br/>encouraged  teachers  to  upgrade  their  qualifications  and,  of  course,  SODELPA  and  NFP  quickly 
<br/>joined the bandwagon to criticise the Ministry.  I fail to understand why unions do not want their 
<br/>members to get salary upgrades, and I would like to inform everyone that there are teachers who will 
<br/>be getting a salary upgrade by $8,000 and that is a substantial amount for a year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  learning  and 
<br/>teaching,  upgrading  salaries  in  line  with  the  Teacher  Remuneration  Setting  Policy  which  was 
<br/>introduced by this Government  to  motivate teachers to  upgrade their qualification so that we can 
<br/>provide a qualified workforce for the Ministry of Education. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Minister  for  her  response  to  that 
<br/>question.  My question  is, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament as to when and how will 
<br/>this new salary increase for the 347 teachers be done regarding the fact that she has mentioned that 
<br/>they are from the urban, rural, maritime and remote schools?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, out of 600 teachers who have upgraded 
<br/>their qualification, we have already paid out 270, so 364 is left. We will be making that payment 
<br/></span><span>within the next two weeks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will take the sixth Oral Question, then later we will take the fifth Oral 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budgetary Allocation – Emergency Water Supplies 
<br/>(Question No. 56/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the utilisation of the 
<br/>budgetary allocation for Emergency Water Supplies? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme has been with the Ministry of Rural Development  since 
<br/>1983 when we look back at our records.  This allocation is usually to cater for prolonged dry periods 
<br/>where rural communities have problems with their water sources and it is mainly used for the cartage 
<br/>of water and, of course, for the provision of water as well, plus some of the accessories that go with 
<br/>it - water pumps, hoses, tanks, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the current financial year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we allocated $300,000 and we have used about 
<br/>29  percent  of  that  allocation  which  is  around  $87,000.    As  I  had  already  stated  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament, Sir, the forecast for the season, because we are in a La Nina period, there will be a lot of 
<br/>rainfall and this is why there is slow utilisation.  While we have a lot of rainfall in most parts of Fiji, 
<br/>yet there are some places that are also experiencing water shortages or water problems and thus, the 
<br/>allocation, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just quickly go through some of the places where this is used, as I 
<br/>have  already  alluded  to,  particularly  in  the  Central  Division  because  I  will  start  with  the  Central 
<br/>Division.  Usually the </span><span>tikina</span><span> of Namara and the </span><span>tikina</span><span> of Verata, they have water issues. So, we had 
<br/>about 30,000 litres of water carted by the Ministry of Rural Development through its NDMO tank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and, of course, we have about 45,000 as well, carted by WAF with the rural water component that is 
<br/>with, because they do service these areas almost every fortnight as well. Nailogatabua District School 
<br/>again  in  Verata,  Vunibokoi  District  School,  Namara  District  School  in  Tailevu,  Namara  Nursing 
<br/>Station and the Verata Nursing Station as well.  I will not touch on the details of those cartage, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally  we  have  Anitioki,  Naisogovau,  Naivakacau,  Waikete,  Daku,  Vanuadina, 
<br/>Naqeledamu,  Muana-i-ra.    In  Rewa  -  Waica,  Delaiveisari  and  Wailekutu,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    In 
<br/>Naitasiri,  the  Vunidawa  Government  Quarters,  Vuisiga,  Baulevu  Hillside.    In  Serua  –  Nautovau, 
<br/>Nakoba, Navutulevu.  In Namosi – Naqara Island.  In the Northern Division was the hiring of the 
<br/>barge from Lautoka for Kia Island. That costed about $9,000 and the supply of some water tanks that 
<br/>were already moved to the Northern Division and stored in the yard at Vatunibale awaiting further 
<br/>request from the communities, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Western Division, we also have carted water to Yanuya and Tavuya Islands.  This is in 
<br/>the  Malolo  Group  of  islands,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Included  in  the  Northern  Division  was  the 
<br/>procurement of two water pumps.  This is for the trailer-mounted water tanks that they have in the 
<br/>Northern Division so these water pumps were to replace the two water pumps that were mounted on 
<br/></span><span>it and were stolen from the yard in Vatunibale.  That very briefly is the utilisation of the allocation 
<br/></span><span>as of today.

<div><span>Succession Planning to Address Leadership Needs 
<br/>(Question No. 55/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on succession 
<br/>planning in the Civil Service to address leadership needs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we talk about succession planning 
<br/>in the civil service, we have to actually refer to what exactly should the civil service do and, in fact, 
<br/>that is guided by the Constitution.  Section 123 of the Constitution says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “The values and principles of the State service include- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>high standards of professionalism, including professional ethics and integrity; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>prompt and faithful implementation of Government policies and administration of laws; 
<br/>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being free from corruption; 
<br/>efficient, effective and economic use of public resources; 
<br/>prompt response to requests and questions from the public, and delivery of service to the 
<br/>public, in a manner that is respectful, effective, impartial, fair and equitable; 
<br/>accountability for administrative conduct; 
<br/>transparency, including – 
<br/>(i)  
<br/>(ii)  prompt, complete and candid reporting to Parliament, as required by law; 
<br/>cultivation of good human resource management and career development practices, to 
<br/>maximise human potential; and  
<br/>recruitment and promotion based on –  
<br/>(i) 
<br/>(ii) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objectivity, impartiality and fair competition; and 
<br/>ability, education, experience and other characteristics of merit.”

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>957 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, succession planning, obviously, needs to be guided by these principles, and I sometimes think 
<br/>that when honourable Members of the Opposition start talking about succession planning, they are 
<br/>focused on personalities or individuals (one or two) who may or may not exactly be meritorious and 
<br/>earmarking  them  for  senior  positions  in  the  organisation  where  there  is  actually  no  regard  for 
<br/>competency or capabilities.  That appears to be the definition of leadership needs, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>That,  of  course,  is  a  practice  of  the  past.    The  clause  on  merit  practise  was  subjective  and 
<br/>disadvantaged many qualified and competent people in our workforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Succession planning for leadership needs in the Civil Service is much more than that.  When we talk 
<br/>about  leadership  needs in the  Civil  Service, we  are talking about  having  people who espouse the 
<br/>values and principles that I have just enunciated from Section 123 of the Constitution.  Furthermore, 
<br/>Sir, as we can see that the Fijian Civil Service is grounded on the principles or high standards of 
<br/>professionalism,  one  must  have  ethics,  integrity,  and  that  is  work  in  progress  and  we  have 
<br/>continuously  said  in  Parliament  that  we  are  constantly  rolling  out  guidelines  and  new  ways,  for 
<br/>example, of improving business processes and making things transparent and making sure that people 
<br/>respond to members of the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Succession planning, therefore, is about identifying the knowledge and skills required for a 
<br/></span><span>particular position and shifting the focus on ensuring there is a level playing field with regards to 
<br/></span><span>upwards mobility in the  Service.  Succession planning in the traditional sense was, if someone is 
<br/>here, the next person or the next rank and next one up there, therefore, you go progressively like a 
<br/>linear progression.  That is not necessarily creating leadership qualities or succession planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it means that succession planning in the Civil Service begins with ensuring 
<br/>the basis upon which people join the Service on principles of open merit, fairness and transparency.  
<br/>Introduction of the Open Merit Recruitment and Selection Guidelines allows those with leadership 
<br/>aspirations to actually apply for and be in the running for these positions and not just a select few or 
<br/>those who kind of progress on a linear basis.  This allows us to engage those who have passion for 
<br/>leadership in the Civil Service, regardless of where one is from.  This begins with having the right 
<br/>people in the right jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the old mentality that only civil servants can be promoted to higher positions 
<br/>is outdated in today’s modern context.  Employing meritorious people from outside the Civil Service 
<br/>brings in, sometimes, fresh perspectives, new skillsets that does not exist in the Civil Service, and 
<br/>allows  for  diversity  which,  in  turn,  creates  a  more  dynamic  and  responsive  Civil  Service.    For 
<br/>example,  one  of  the  issues  that  we  have  talked  about  as  we  have  discussed  with  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Health today, the old way of looking at succession planning in the Ministry of Health 
<br/>was, that if you became a senior doctor you actually ran the hospital.  So you are doing administration 
<br/>which  you are not  actually  trained for.  You are  trained to  be a doctor,  you are not  trained to  be 
<br/>someone who is going to look after the supply of medicine, fix up the broken louvers or making sure 
<br/>that  the  machine  gets  repaired  on  time  and  getting  the  servicing  done.  That  is  someone  who  is 
<br/>probably more competent in logistics, in the administration, in HR, for example, not a doctor </span><span>per se</span><span>.  
<br/>A doctor’s main focus is getting the sick patient better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  new  approach  needs  to  be  adopted  as  far  as  the  Civil  Service  is 
<br/>concerned, of course.  It does not mean we do not invest in our Civil Service, those civil servants 
<br/>who are actually within the system, as you know that many civil servants, in fact, go for overseas 
<br/>training, we have in-house training also and they are given an exposure to many different experiences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of them are so  well trained that we find  a lot of them  get 
<br/>recruited by other agencies and that is precisely what we announced in the Budget, that we are now 
<br/>going to look at those highly skilled areas where there is scarcity and retention issues. For example,

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the Civil Service now too with a lot of the private hospitals and private clinics opening up, they 
<br/>are poaching nurses from the public service.  Because of COVID-19, there is a huge demand for 
<br/>healthcare workers not just in Fiji but overseas, so they are also poaching our good people too. There 
<br/>is huge movement of people.  Caregivers are now going to overseas. There is a huge movement of 
<br/>people globally and also regionally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have embedded a practice of ensuring that every position, apart from 
<br/>required  qualifications,  has  clearly-articulated  knowledge,  experience,  skills  and  abilities  which 
<br/>makes  it  easier  to  identify  potential  successors  through  an  OMRS  system  and  also  identify  the 
<br/>relevant training needs for those positions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of Review of MSMECGS by RBF 
<br/>(Question No. 57/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the status 
<br/></span><span>of  the  review  of  Fiji’s  Micro  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme 
<br/></span><span>undertaken by the Reserve Bank of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just by way of background, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Credit 
<br/>Guarantee Scheme (MSMECGS) was established in 2012 and is administered by the Reserve Bank 
<br/>of Fiji (RBF). The aim of the Scheme is to encourage and expand private sector lending to Micro, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and also complement the Governments initiative to promote MSME 
<br/>development, investment and local business activity. Under the Scheme, Sir, Government guarantees 
<br/>the  outstanding  principal  amount  on  defaulted  loans  which  are  available  to  all  Micro,  Small  and 
<br/>Medium businesses with a turnover of up to $1.25 million per year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following the last review in 2020, Sir, the risk sharing arrangement between the Government 
<br/>and the lenders was enhanced, allowing Government to increase its guarantee to 60 percent of the 
<br/>principal outstanding on defaulted MSME loans up to a limit of $60,000 per business from 50 percent 
<br/>or $50,000. In addition, to encourage women participation in businesses and support the development 
<br/>of  rural  areas  and  traditional  sectors,  the  Government  guarantee  was  raised  to  75  percent  of  the 
<br/>principal outstanding on defaulted loans up to a limit of $75,000 for businesses on all MSME loans 
<br/>to women entrepreneurs, as well as to those involved in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of January 2022, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 264 businesses with $11.3 million in loans 
<br/>were covered under the Scheme. However, the default rate is, in fact, very low. Only 30 businesses 
<br/>have defaulted to-date, in fact, it was very few even before COVID-19 and just because of COVID-
<br/>19, the amount of exposure has only been $0.32 million. This means that the Scheme is successful 
<br/>as 314 businesses have benefitted from accessing loans where the interest rate is kept at 9.45 percent.  
<br/>Because of the guarantee, the requirement for equity contribution was also lower than normal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Scheme has  helped established MSMEs to  access  finance and at  the 
<br/>same time, enabled lending institutions to share part of the risk with Government, and we encourage 
<br/>all the private sector banks to do so too.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>959 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Scheme, under the COVID-19 Recovery Credit 
<br/>Guarantee Scheme in the 2021-2022 National Budget, the Government via RBF has made available 
<br/>$200 million to  the COVID-19 Recovery Credit Guarantee Scheme to  help  businesses meet  their 
<br/>working capital needs, for example, paying for labour cost, rental cost, utility bills, purchase of stock, 
<br/>et cetera.  Under the Scheme, Sir, existing micro businesses with turnover below $50,000 can access 
<br/>up to $10,000. Small businesses with annual turnover between $50,000 and $300,000, can access up 
<br/>to $20,000. Medium-sized businesses with turnover between $300,000 and $1.25 million can, in fact, 
<br/>access up to $100,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the loan guarantee for micro enterprises, for example, we guarantee up to 
<br/>90 percent for those who borrowed $10,000 or less. We guarantee up to 85 percent for those who 
<br/>borrowed $20,000 or less.  We guarantee 80 percent for those who borrowed $50,000 or less. We 
<br/>guarantee 75 percent for those who borrow $100,000 or less.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members from the other side may recall that we, in fact, pay 
<br/>their interest rate.  There is a budgetary allocation.  We pay their interest rate for the first two years 
<br/>and they pay no more than 3.99 percent.  There is no principal payment required, Sir, and in the third 
<br/>year, they then start doing their principal payment  and  also  their interest. So they  get  a two-year 
<br/></span><span>window of opportunity to be able to borrow money, build up their business or rebuild their business 
<br/></span><span>in most cases, be able to stand on their feet and then there is a commitment in respect of paying those 
<br/>loans, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of 1st April, 2022, a total of 5,471 loan applications have been approved 
<br/>to  a tune of roughly $114.7 million.   Of the successful applicants,  47  percent or 2,573 are micro 
<br/>businesses; 31 percent or 1,718 are small businesses; 13 percent or 703 are medium-sized businesses; 
<br/>and 9 percent or 477 are, in fact, large businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the value of loans disbursed, around 16 percent of the total loan value is for micro 
<br/>businesses, 21 percent for small businesses, 26 percent for medium-sized businesses and 37 percent 
<br/>for large businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Todate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government also paid out $203 million as interest subsidy for the 
<br/>loans, as I had mentioned earlier on, covered under the guarantee scheme. The total interest cost to 
<br/>Government on the $114.7 million loan facility approved over two years would be $9.2 million.  Of 
<br/>course, as I have mentioned, there is no principal payment, there is no payment of fees or charges, et 
<br/>cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this scheme has served its objective since 5,047 new businesses have been 
<br/>assisted in this initiative, the bulk of which are MSMEs.  The $112.4 million disbursed to-date is 
<br/>timely  and,  of  course,  it  ensures  that  disruptions  to  business  operations  are  minimised  and  much 
<br/>needing working capital is pumped into these businesses so they can continue to survive and, indeed, 
<br/>create and continue to create more jobs for our ordinary Fijians. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to pose a question on that response. In 
<br/>some of the audit findings on the scheme, majority of the loans that have been registered since the 
<br/>inception of the scheme were not eligible to be covered and, therefore, have not complied with all 
<br/>the  requirements  of  the  MSMECGS  Guidelines  2016.    The  annual  turnover  of  some  of  their 
<br/>businesses, whose loans were registered under the scheme since its inception in 2012 had acceded 
<br/>the $500,000 threshold, hence it did not comply with the SMECGS Guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, what is the Reserve Bank of Fiji and the related financial institutions doing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about this non-compliance so that it does not happen again in the future?

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish the honourable Member had actually 
<br/>asked a substantive question rather than going on his goosechase, getting me to answer a question 
<br/>about, can the Minister update Parliament on the status of review. He should have asked me straight 
<br/>out from whatever he was referring to.  This is the kind of shenanigans we have to go through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know which audit that he is talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The 2020 Audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  But  if  you  want  to  look  at  the  success  of  this  Guarantee 
<br/>Scheme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the default rate is so low, that is what we should be talking about.  All 
<br/>these guarantee schemes, prior to even the COVID-19 one, we had very low rates of default, only a 
<br/>handful of people defaulted.  Very little exposure, in other words, all the businesses  – the micro, 
<br/>small and medium enterprises that were assisted were able to flourish.  Only because of COVID-19 
<br/>we had about 30 businesses that defaulted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notwithstanding that, the rate of defaulting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not even $1 million, out of 
<br/>the $11.3 million. I ask that you go and look at the statistics of what FDB had rolled in many decades 
<br/></span><span>ago and look at the rate of default then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Impact of Russia-Ukraine War on Fijian Economy 
<br/>(Question No. 58/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the impact 
<br/>of the Russia-Ukraine war on the Fijian economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt and we are all aware of 
<br/>the unprovoked war that Russia actually has commenced against Ukraine, where there is an untold 
<br/>damage and, of course, loss of lives.  It would appear now on both sides, including Russian troops 
<br/>and Ukraine civilians and military also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  Russia’s  action,  Sir,  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO),  and  its 
<br/>members in the wider global community has, in fact, imposed harsh economic and financial sanctions 
<br/>on Russia, including freezing Russian Central Bank assets, targeting wealthy Russian oligarchs and 
<br/>some State-owned banks, partially restricting its access to the international payment system, which 
<br/>is called SWIFT.  In other words, having an impact on the banking system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  will  cause  a  deep  recession  in  Russia,  in  the  event  of  a  prolonged 
<br/>conflict.  The sharp depreciation of the Ruble has fuelled inflation and lowered living standards in 
<br/>Russia.  Countries with direct economic ties with Russia will also be affected by the sanctions with 
<br/>weakened trade remittances, investment and tourism adversely affecting economic growth, inflation 
<br/>and, of course, external fiscal accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond  the  human  and  economic  suffering  in  Ukraine,  Sir,  the  entire  global  economy  is 
<br/>feeling the effects of the conflict through three main channels.  Firstly, the higher prices for food and 
<br/>energy are pushing up inflation further, even after pandemic, eroding purchasing power and putting 
<br/>a downward pressure on demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>961 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Ukraine’s  direct  trading  partners  and  neighbouring  countries  are  experiencing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disruptions to trade, supply chain and remittances, not to mention a historic surge in refugee inflows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  weaker  business  confidence  and  high  investment  uncertainty  will  lead  to  a  tighter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>global financial conditioning, and possible capital flight from the emerging markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both,  Russia  and  Ukraine,  are  large  producers  and  exporters  of  key  food  commodities, 
<br/>minerals and energy.  Today, they account for about 30 percent of global wheat exports, 20 percent 
<br/>of corn, mineral fertilisers and natural gas exports and 11 percent of oil exports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  naturally,  this  war  has  created  a  sizeable  global  economic  and  financial 
<br/>shocks, particularly, in commodity markets, when the prices of oil, gas and wheat recently soaring.  
<br/>For fuel, especially, the conflict has exacerbated, the mismatch between global demand and supply 
<br/>are pushing crude oil prices above US$100 a barrel in March, levels not seen actually since 2008.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economies  reliant  on  oil  imports,  like  ours,  will  see  wider  fiscal  and  trade  deficits  and 
<br/>inflationary pressures  because of the conflict.   Some exporters, such as those in  the Middle East, 
<br/>Africa and places like Nigeria, may temporarily benefit from higher prices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This elevated inflation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, along with the lack of fiscal space, has prompted 
<br/>many  countries  to  tighten  their  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  posing  further  challenges  to  their 
<br/>economic recovery.  If these shocks are sustained over the short term, the Organisation for Economic 
<br/>Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects  global GDP growth  to  reduce by 1.0 percentage 
<br/>point and inflation rise by a further 2.5 percentage points.  The Ukraine-Russia war has delivered a 
<br/>severe and unfortunate blow to the global economy that will hinder growth and raise prices, just as 
<br/>we are starting to bounce back from the pandemic-induced recession. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, global trade disruptions and inflationary pressures are likely to intensify as 
<br/>the conflict drags on.  Fiji has already begun to experience the spill-over effects of these trade shocks, 
<br/>with imported inflation pushing up domestic fuel and food prices in recent months.  Fiji is particularly 
<br/>susceptible to fuel price shocks, given that fuel accounts for roughly one-third of our total import 
<br/>bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Domestic  fuel  prices  depend  on  three  factors  -  the  world  market  price  for  refined  oil, 
<br/>benchmarked  by  the  Mean  of  Platts  Singapore  (MOPS)  international  freight  rates  and  foreign 
<br/>exchange rates.  Moreover, Sir, refinery margins, distribution costs, insurance freight and transport 
<br/>costs and geopolitical pressures also influence the direction of international fuel prices in any given 
<br/>month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC)  recently  noted  that  the 
<br/>international  price  of  crude  oil  is  expected  to  increase  significantly  in  the  coming  months  also, 
<br/>signalling higher domestic prices for refined fuel products in the near term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, notably, local retail price for diesel - plus 2.1 percent; unleaded - plus 1.1 
<br/>percent; premix - plus 10.7 percent; kerosene - plus 1.1 percent, 4.5 kilogramme gas cylinder - plus 
<br/>2.2 percent; and 12 kilogramme gas cylinder - plus 4.5 percent; all have increased in April relative 
<br/>to January this year.  So the 9.0 percent is critically important, Sir, to actually provide some form of 
<br/>relief to ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Likewise, Sir, domestic food prices have risen in line with global supply disruptions.  Most 
<br/>notably, the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Cereal Price Index rose in 
<br/>February  by  3.0  percent  over  the  previous  month  and  14.8  percent  from  a  year  ago,  reflecting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disruptions in the Black Sea region that could potentially hinder exports of Ukraine and Russia.  The 
<br/>overall FAO Food Price Index averaged 140.7 points in February, representing a new all-high and a 
<br/>20.7 percent increase from a year ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  domestic  inflation  has  started  to  accelerate  after  remaining  in  the 
<br/>negative territory for nearly two years, growing by an average of nearly 2.0 percent per month since 
<br/>August 2021.  Annual inflation stood at1.9 percent in February, with price increases noted for food 
<br/>and  non-alcoholic  beverages,  health  and  miscellaneous  services,  offset  by  a  lower  price  for 
<br/>restaurants, hotels and transportation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  next  few  months,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  domestic  prices  are  expected  to  rise  further 
<br/>because of fruit and vegetable shortages due to </span><span>TC Cody</span><span> related flooding, and global food and fuel 
<br/>supply disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war.  As a result, EN inflation is now estimated at 4.5 
<br/>percent  for  2022,  followed  by  3.0  percent  for  2023  and  2.6  percent  for  2024.    To  put  that  into 
<br/>perspective, Sir, I have the figures here about the inflation rates in other countries also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In USA, Sir, the inflation rate by the Bureau of Labour Statistics as of February this  year 
<br/>stood at 7.9 percent; India - 6.07 percent; New Zealand - 5.9 percent as of December last year; United 
<br/></span><span>Kingdom  in  February  2022  -  5.5  percent;  Singapore  in  February  2022  -  4.3  percent;  Australia  in 
<br/></span><span>December 2021 - 3.5 percent; EU areas as of February 2022 - 5.9 percent; Russia 9.2 percent; and 
<br/>Germany in February 2022 - 5.1 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, countries like Mauritius is 9.0 percent, 
<br/>et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s GDP, of course, is poised for unprecedented rebound.  Of course, a 
<br/>lot of these can be tampered with in respect of what will happen with the pricing.  That is why, Sir, 
<br/>we have put in place the Revised Budget on the 21 items which is unprecedented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  foreign  reserves  are  actually  quite  high  because  of 
<br/>Government strategically having external draw-downs, which help to cushion the impact of higher 
<br/>commodity prices on our balance of payments position.  As of 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2022, foreign reserves 
<br/>around $3.1 billion is sufficient to cover, at least, 8.6 months of retained import, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will keep a close eye on the fluctuation, in the inflation rate 
<br/>and commodity price in the next few months and if necessary, we may consider additional temporary 
<br/>fiscal measures to shield Fijians from volatile global price markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, in the matters of oil, I know this will be where we are 
<br/>most vulnerable, we know that over the last couple of days, President Biden had approved the release 
<br/>of a couple of billion barrels of oil into the US  market from their reserve, and that has helped  in 
<br/>reducing some of the global price per barrel.  For us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our reserve, how much do we 
<br/>have in terms of oil and is there any possibility going forward that Fiji can carry enough reserve in 
<br/>times of emergency such as this or perhaps on a regional basis with our neighbours?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  fuel  that  is  imported  into  Fiji  is 
<br/>imported  by  the  three  fuel  companies  -  Pacific  Energy,  Total  and  Mobil  and  they  come  from 
<br/>Singapore.  So, there is obviously shipment done on a regular basis and there is enough fuel there 
<br/>but, of course, in terms of storage for months on end, we do not have that capacity.  But, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we need to build large scale investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue at the moment in the world is not shortage </span><span>per se </span><span>but of course it is the pricing 
<br/>because  of  some  certain  supply  chains  have  been  affected.    The  USA,  of  course,  has  got  large 
<br/>reserves.  There has been talk about it in the area of global economy that if the USA actually releases

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a bit more oil into the global market, you could effectively see the prices plummet.  So, it is not really 
<br/>a big issue regarding supply </span><span>per se</span><span> because there is enough reserves all over the world. It is just that 
<br/>people  are  not  releasing  it  on  time  or  trying  to  get  a  bigger  price.    Omsa  Pillar  Astex  Company 
<br/>Limited (OPAC) has its own dynamics and what the predictions are, whilst the prices will go up in 
<br/>the next few months, they expect that the price will actually plummet by round about September or 
<br/>October.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this war will be long-term, it is going to go on 
<br/>because  Russia  will  want  to  collect  all  those  people  there  to  fight  against  Israel.    What  is  the 
<br/>Government doing about getting alternative fuel – wheat, that we can eat in the future, particularly 
<br/>in the field of solar, can we increase that?  Hydro, can we increase that?  Biomass, can we double or 
<br/>increase that?  A lot of places in Fiji were growing wheat at one point in time.  What is the agriculture 
<br/>doing about that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Can we grow more wheat to increase more food, reduce $900,000 
<br/>in  agriculture?  It is long-term, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what does the Government have in place for the 
<br/></span><span>long-term particularly to substitute or reduce the use of fuel and wheat for food? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  hope  the  honourable  Member  in  his 
<br/>soothe saying  is incorrect.  I hope that the war is not going to last for too long but there is a possibility, 
<br/>it could last for a long period of time, but I think there would also be some adjustments made.  At the 
<br/>moment the world is in a bit of shock with what has happened.  I think a lot of the world is in fact 
<br/>reeling from the fact in this modern day and age that how can a country go and invade another country 
<br/>or try to invade which is unprovoked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue, however, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of alternative sources for energy, I do not think 
<br/>the  honourable  Member  has  been  in  this  Parliament,  the  Prime  Minister  has  been  saying 
<br/>internationally, we have internationally made commitments about reducing our fossil fuel usage, in 
<br/>particular, in providing energy for electricity purposes.  We have a target, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to have 
<br/>renewables in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is saying more, yes we are doing more.  It is easier for 
<br/>him  to  just  sit  there  and  pontificate  but  he  has  absolutely  no  clue  how  to  do  more.    The  hydro-
<br/>electricity dam, of course, that was built in 1970s depending on the rainfall and can supply up to 60 
<br/>percent to 65 percent of our energy needs on Viti Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua Levu, of course, where he comes from does not have that source of energy or that type 
<br/>of energy but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are as we heard in Parliament, for example, in Ovalau we have 
<br/>got the Agrophotovoltaic Project that is going ahead that will supply to the grid.  In Taveuni also, we 
<br/>have got the Agrophotovoltaic Project, millions of dollars will be invested.  So those islands will 
<br/>actually be able to get renewable energy and we are obviously doing more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have an Independent Power Producers (IPP) in place where a lot of private companies 
<br/>are now interested in supplying to the grid. In respect of eating wheat, of course, honourable Minister 
<br/>for Agriculture has already stated that they are currently experimenting about having 20 to 25 percent 
<br/>of cassava flour or cassava mill in normal flour will actually reduce our usage to 100  percent our 
<br/>usage of wheat, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other alternative, of course, honourable Bulanauca, whilst you are packing your bag to 
<br/>leave, is that Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should stop eating wheat products.  The alternative, of course, to 
<br/>wheat is, everyone wants to eat </span><span>purini, babakau, panikeke</span><span>, bread, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We eat </span><span>roti</span><span> that 
<br/>is made out of flour, there are alternatives to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned also, Ukraine also produced a lot of corn.  The alternative wheat is corn 
<br/>or  maze.    Central  American  countries  grow  it,  South  American  countries  grow  it,  so  there  are 
<br/>alternatives and I think as we have seen that the human capacity to be able to adapt, a lot of people 
<br/>do  change.  So,  if  we  have  more  dalo,  cassava,  </span><span>bele,</span><span> </span><span>bhaji,</span><span> </span><span>bhindi,  boda,  </span><span>et  cetera,  these  are 
<br/>alternatives and that is what we can do, individually change in our own lives rather than saying what 
<br/>is government going to do about it.  These things are only imported because there is a consumption 
<br/>demand for it.  Private companies actually import it.  The wheat that we bring into Fiji is brought by 
<br/>two private companies, so I think there needs to be a bit more appreciation of what other dynamics 
<br/>at play and I am sure the world will actually make the adjustments accordingly.
