<div><span>VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Value Added Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 be considered by Parliament without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament today, 4th April, 2022, and that one 
<br/>hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving 
<br/>this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Value Added Tax (Amendment) (No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2) Bill 2022 is, in fact, an amendment to the Value Added Tax Act 1991.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we presented the Budget last week, there were about 1,500 Custom 
<br/>Tariff Code items that were provided by Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS) to cater for the 
<br/>changes proposed in the Revised 2021-2022 Budget.  From the 1,500 Customs Tariff Codes that were 
<br/>provided by FRCS, one code was incorrectly referenced and one code was not included.  That code 
<br/>was incorrectly referenced, included the reference to the Customs Tariff Code for gas stoves, which 
<br/>was  incorrectly  referenced  as  7323.181.00  when,  in  fact,  it  should  have  been  referenced  as 
<br/>7321.81.00. The Customs Tariff Code for sanitary pads was not included as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implications of incorrectly referencing the code for gas stoves would mean that the VAT 
<br/>applicable to the importation of gas stoves would remain at 9.0 percent with the intention was to 
<br/>increase the VAT import on gas stoves to be 15 percent.  The implications not included in the code 
<br/>for sanitary pads would mean that VAT applicable to the supplier of sanitary pads would have to 
<br/>remain at 9.0 percent but the intention was to decrease the VAT on sanitary pads to zero  percent.  
<br/>The incorrect reference to the concession code for gas stove and the non-inclusion of the code for 
<br/>sanitary pads will not only create confusion amongst the importers and retailers, it can give rise to 
<br/>operational issues at FRCS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the benefit of the honourable Members of Parliament, we still have applied these codes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as they were intentioned to but we need to now legally correct the actual coding itself.  It is an 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VAT (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operational matter, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The amendment just seeks to change and the Members will be 
<br/>given a copy of the  Bill,  you can just see, it is  just  substituting the code numbers;  that is  all this 
<br/>amendment seeks to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we will have right of reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make the objection of  tabling 
<br/>this Bill under Standing Order 51, as raised by the honourable Minister for Economy.  He made two 
<br/>comments, towards the end he said, “This is only an operational matter.”  But the bigger matter that 
<br/>I want to raise is that, the initial amendment to the VAT Bill that came as Consequential Bills during 
<br/>the debate of the Budget had some of the mistakes that he is trying to correct here, which he says, 
<br/>“are only minor issues”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have been standing in this Parliament, objecting to the process of rushing the Bill 
<br/>under Standing Order 51, and there is no surprise about that.  But it brings out the very nature of the 
<br/>need to be given time to go through the proper process, at least, the process of the Money Bill, put it 
<br/>through the Committee, it might take a lot of time, yes, but it avoids all these embarrassment to say, 
<br/></span><span>“Yes, we tabled that but we made mistakes” because Parliament has been making decisions on the 
<br/></span><span>basis of information that really is incorrect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, if Parliament had, through the process that is already in the Standing Orders, be allowed 
<br/>to  peruse  and  look  at  these  Bills,  however,  minor  the  proposals  may  be,  then  things  like  making 
<br/>mistakes as being like minor in this case about just list of things, commas, t’s  not crossed, i’s  not 
<br/>dotted, will not happen.  I have not read this, I know it is proposing something, but to move it again 
<br/>under Standing Order 51, I object to it, and that it should, at least, go through some scrutiny process 
<br/>which Parliament does not have to go through this issue again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Anyone else wishing to participate in the debate?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There being no one wishing to participate in the debate, honourable Attorney-General, you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the floor for the Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were taught in Marist, it takes a bigger 
<br/>person to recognise that you have actually made a mistake, it takes courage to do that rather than 
<br/>pontificating about people who have actually made mistakes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, it is got nothing to do with processes.  The honourable 
<br/>Member, I think maybe he has just been influenced by </span><span>paapi</span><span>, I know he was in Vunimono the other 
<br/>day but, Sir, it is just simply a question of a code number that was given to us incorrectly by FRCS.  
<br/>It is simply a question of putting into effect the fact that we said that sanitary pads must be made zero 
<br/>percent.  What he is saying, is that, women who need to buy sanitary pads should not go and pay zero 
<br/>percent.  That is what he is saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>939 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I submit to you, I did not say those words 
<br/>that the honourable Attorney-General is putting in my mouth.  I am not implying it. My implication 
<br/>is quite clear. I just said, if we went through the proper process, those mistakes would not have been 
<br/>made then it would have been okay.  He should withdraw that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I will say it again, Sir, the implication of what he is saying 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>means that people do not get to pay zero percent on sanitary pads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I can also safely say that even when we had one week, 
<br/>when we had a full budget and we had tariff codes, none of them read the tariff codes. When we have 
<br/>1,500 tariff codes, none of them checked at each single tariff code - 83.0.110.2, none of them looked 
<br/>at it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Even when they had the whole one week before, none of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them looked at it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So, now he is coming back, making some cheap political 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mileage point he is trying to, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  simply  a  question  of,  if  he  reads,  you  do  not  need  to  go  to  Munro  Leys  for  legal 
<br/>opinion,  you  need  to  simply  look  at,  it  says  “7323.81.00  substituting  7321.8100”.  It  captures  the 
<br/>actual item, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They have been given these thick tariff codes, they have got it in their 
<br/>rooms and they can go and check against that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this essentially gives substance to what we announced last week; that is all 
<br/>it does.  So, there is no legal issue as such in respect of it going to change some policy, it is actually 
<br/>giving effect to the policy which Parliament approved last week, Sir; that is all it does.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a similar way, Sir, I have got another Bill which is the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Bill. 
<br/>Again, with the same two of the issues with the code numbers were referenced to us incorrectly by 
<br/>FRCS.  We rely on the people, the different agencies to give us that information. If they had given 
<br/>us the wrong code, they have come forward to us, it is better that they come forward to us and they 
<br/>said, “look we have made a mistake, sorry about it”.  It is our job to come and correct it and I take 
<br/>full responsibility for it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though we were given the wrong code, I take full responsibility for it and I have no 
<br/>shame in doing so because we are actually putting in place these 21 items that have been reduced to 
<br/>zero VAT. We have got some other items about 21 categories in which we have increased VAT to 
<br/>15 percent. If the code was given to us incorrectly, I am not going to blame FRCS – okay they made 
<br/>a mistake, they have given it to us but I am the one who tabled it.  So, I take full responsibility for it. 
<br/>Here I am, Sir, getting it corrected.  I am getting it corrected, Sir and I am asking Parliament to prove

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022

<div><span>this because it actually gives approval to the zero percent of sanitary pads and 15 percent to the gas 
<br/>stoves, that is all there is to it.
