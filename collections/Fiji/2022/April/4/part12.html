<div><span>Review Report – Fiji National Sports Commission 2019-July 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Report  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) 
<br/>for  the  period  from  August  2019  to  July  2020.    This  review  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with 
<br/>Standing  Order  109(2)(b),  which  mandates  the  Committee  to  look  into  issues  related  to  health, 
<br/>education, social services, labour, culture and media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  first  met  to  deliberate  in  March  of  this  year  and  formulated  questions 
<br/>pertaining to the Annual Report which were sent to the FNSC for its response.  Upon receipt of all 
<br/>relevant  information  on  the  Committee’s  queries,  the  Committee  compiled  its  findings  and 
<br/>subsequently endorsed its Report in March.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No significant issues arose during the Committee’s scrutiny of the operations and financial 
<br/>statements  of  the  FNSC  for  the  review  period,  however,  the  Committee  has  made  two 
<br/></span><span>recommendations to the FNSC for the enhancement of its service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, the FNSC should consider working with the Ministry of Youth and Sports and other 
<br/>agencies, such as Municipal Councils and the Ministry of Housing and Community Development, to 
<br/>identify and upgrade grounds for community use in rural and peri-urban areas.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the Committee recognises that the FNSC faced challenges in the achievement of 
<br/>some of its strategic objectives due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, with the 
<br/>easing  of  COVID-19  restrictions,  we  are  of  the  view  that  the  FNSC  should  engage  in  a  more 
<br/>concerted effort with its stakeholders for the sustenance of its sports development programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Executive Chairman of the FNSC, Mr. Peter Mazey, and 
<br/>his staff for their timely assistance in the review process.  I also extend my gratitude to my Committee 
<br/>colleagues,  namely:  honourable  George  Vegnathan  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable  Alipate 
<br/>Nagata,  honourable  Salote  Radrodro  and  honourable  Dr.  Ratu  Atonio  Lalabalavu,  for  their 
<br/>contributions during the Committee’s deliberations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report of the Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Investment Fiji, previously known as the Fiji Trade 
<br/>&amp;  Investment  Bureau,  is  the  marketing  arm  of  the  Fijian  Government,  and  the  organisation  is 
<br/>governed  by  the  1999  Foreign  Investment  Act,  which  outlines  its  role  around  registering  and 
<br/>monitoring foreign investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Act makes no mention of promoting, attracting and facilitating foreign investment and 
<br/>exports. However, 23 years later, having an agency that solely promotes and facilitates investment 
<br/>and exports has never been more important for the growth of the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  improve  Fiji’s  investment  climate,  a  reform  journey  was  initiated  by  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government in 2017 to highlight areas of strength, gaps and weaknesses in the existing legal and 
<br/>policy framework for foreign investment and identify reform action plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  forward  to  2019,  Fiji’s  first  Investment  Policy  Statement  was  established  which 
<br/>required that resources be channelled towards attracting the right kind of investment and investors.  
<br/>One key outcome of this exercise was having a comprehensive Investment Act that provides rights, 
<br/>protection and obligations to both, domestic and foreign investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  new  Investment  Act  2021,  both  foreign  and  domestic  investors  will  be  treated 
<br/>equally, Investment Fiji will move away from the regulatory function of issuing Foreign Investment 
<br/>Registration Certificates and monitoring investment projects, and instead will focus on promoting 
<br/>and facilitating both, domestic and foreign investment and exports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further,  the  Investment  Fiji  Bill  2022  shifts  Investment  Fiji’s  focus  from  screening  and 
<br/>monitoring  to  becoming  an  investment  and  trade  promotion  agency.    Under  this  new  law,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>935 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>screening that is traditionally undertaken by Investment Fiji will lie in the hands of the respective 
<br/>Tier 1 Government Agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This transition is important and very timely, not only for the organisation but for Fiji as a 
<br/>whole,  as  COVID-19  has  brought  to  the  forefront  Fiji’s  imperative  need  for  foreign  exchange 
<br/>earnings, and this can be addressed by increasing foreign investment and exports.   Sir, COVID-19 
<br/>has also brought to the surface the importance that Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) play in 
<br/>attracting  foreign  direct  investments  from  an  already  shrinking  pot,  in  a  very  noisy  promotion 
<br/>market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to present the Committee’s Report on the review of 
<br/>the Investment Fiji Bill 2022. To begin with, Sir, as part of the efforts of developing and improving 
<br/>Fiji’s economy,  a  lot  of  changes  have  been  introduced  by  the  Fijian Government, including 
<br/>the review of the Investment Framework.  The first step of the changes to the Investment Framework 
<br/>was brought about in the review of the Foreign Investment Act 1999, which was then subsequently 
<br/>replaced by the Investment Act 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Investment Act introduced certain changes to the Investment Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which included:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the repeal of the Investment Act 1999; 
<br/>the  establishment  of  legal,  social  and  economic  principles  for  the  development  of 
<br/>investment activity in Fiji;  
<br/>defining the rights, duties and responsibilities of domestic and foreign investors;  
<br/>providing  equity  for  investors  with  transparent,  reliable,  efficient  and  fair  rules  or 
<br/>procedures within the framework of international entities and agreements to which Fiji is a 
<br/>party;  
<br/>removing the issuance of Foreign Investment Registration Certificates by Investment Fiji; 
<br/>and  
<br/>removing the power for Investment Fiji to conduct investigations and inspections necessary 
<br/>for the purpose of regulating foreign investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those changes brought by Investment Act consequently led to the review of the Investment 
<br/>Fiji Act 1980 and the realignment of the functions of Investment Fiji in  order to complement the 
<br/>changes brought by the Investment Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Investment Fiji Bill 2022 is the outcome of the review of the 1980 Act, 
<br/>which is being proposed to be replaced. The Bill will realign the mandate and functions of Investment 
<br/>Fiji to be of a promotional agency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Parliament had referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights for review on 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022, pursuant to Standing Order 51 and required the 
<br/>Report  back  to  Parliament  in  the  March  2022  Parliament  Sitting.  However,  due  to  the  change  in 
<br/>Parliament Sitting Calendar for this year, the Committee is now reporting back at this current sitting 
<br/>of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill proposes the following new mandates for Investment Fiji –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  promote  Fiji’s  competitive  and  comparative  advantages  which  would  increase  the 
<br/>contribution made by the investors to Fiji’s economy;  
<br/>to  facilitate  all  necessary  information  and  services  to  assist  prospective  and  existing 
<br/>investors to meet their specific investment project needs;

<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> to facilitate and promote the development and expansion of export;  
<br/>to provide aftercare by providing investors with assistance to overcome any challenges to 
<br/>the growth and expansion of their activities, and support investors with their expansion and 
<br/>diversification objectives;  
<br/>Investment Fiji would also be responsible for policy advocacy by collecting information 
<br/>and  raising  awareness  on  the  challenges  faced  by  investors  and  recommend  reform 
<br/>measures to improve Fiji’s investment and business=enabling environment; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>working on image building which would promote Fiji as a desirable investment destination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  review,  the  Committee  endeavoured  to  have  as  much  public 
<br/>participation as possible and that was by having public consultation on the Bill.  It was encouraging 
<br/>to see the amount of people that turned up to the public consultation meetings, despite the apparent 
<br/>hardships that many were facing at the time the Committee was conducting these meetings around 
<br/>Vanua Levu and Vitilevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a great support on the introduction of the Bill, as most noted that it is aimed at 
<br/>improving the Investment Framework in Fiji. Also, there were comments raised about a few concerns 
<br/>regarding the Investment Framework in Fiji, and a few of which include the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to provide more support to local investors; 
<br/>need to have more collaboration between Government institutions and investors, especially 
<br/>the local investors; 
<br/>need to have proper data regarding natural resources which are utilised by investors and 
<br/>which are adequately provided to the investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  end  of  the  review,  the  Committee  extensively  deliberated  on  the 
<br/>submissions received and believes that the Bill as it was tabled in Parliament adequately addresses 
<br/>the concerns raised by the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also puts forth a few recommendations for Parliament’s consideration, which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it believes may assist in the effective implementation of this proposed law and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  respective  institutions  which  deal  with  investment  collaborate  better  in  order  to 
<br/>provide an investment environment that is appealing to investors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That adequate resources are provided to Investment Fiji to enable it to effectively carry out 
<br/>the  work,  whether  it  be  its  investment  promotional  functions  or  assisting  relevant 
<br/>institutions in capacity building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That there be a monitoring and evaluation system that is set up, which effectively monitors 
<br/>the work carried by Investment Fiji and the Investment Framework as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, the Committee acknowledges the Parliament - your office, 
<br/>Sir, and the Office of the Secretary-General to Parliament for allowing public participation as part of 
<br/>the  legislative  making  process  by  supporting  and  encouraging  the  Committee  to  conduct  public 
<br/>consultation on the Bill.  I would like to thank everyone who participated in the public consultation.  
<br/>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the Parliament IT Team and Media Team for its support, 
<br/>which enabled the Committee to do awareness of the review and broadcast its public consultation 
<br/>meetings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the Committee: honourable Alvick
