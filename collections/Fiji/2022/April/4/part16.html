<div><span>CUSTOMS TARIFF (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to resolution of Parliament 
<br/>earlier today, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Customs Tariff (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

<div><span>Customs Tariff (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, similar to the earlier amendment that we 
<br/>sought because of the  tariff code numbering that was incorrectly put in, I would like to correct that 
<br/>and one of them relates to the gas stoves and the other one is in respect of the concession code for 
<br/>the Fijian Drua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know as announced in the Budget, the Fijian Government will acquire 51 percent of 
<br/>Drua. It is a privately renowned company, 49 percent of that will be owned by the Fiji Rugby Union.  
<br/>In time to come, obviously, the Fijian Government can sell off its shares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Drua franchise required, at least, $6 million from the Fijian Government.  Because the 
<br/>Drua is a private company, Government could not, of course, give it a grant because taxpayers’ funds 
<br/>cannot be, by law, used in private companies that is not bound by Government at all.  So, in order to 
<br/>help Drua and we have seen, of course, the Fijiana Drua are obviously, doing fantastically well, in 
<br/>fact, they are obliterating all opposition, I think we should all be very proud of them and perhaps, 
<br/>take this occasion to put our hands together for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expect the men to improve in time to 
<br/></span><span>come but we believe the franchise is actually a worthwhile investment for us. The Fijian Government 
<br/>will be investing, as I have said by December of this year, $6 million.  We have allocated $3 million 
<br/>in this Revised Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the other aspect of it was that, we have said that anyone that sponsors the Drua franchise 
<br/>will  be  eligible  for  200  percent  tax  deduction  should  they  sponsor  anything  above  $250,000.   
<br/>Normally, when we have this tax concession or deduction, we have a particular code for it.  In this 
<br/>particular instance, Sir, the code that was, in fact, inputted by FRCS was a different code, as opposed 
<br/>to the code that should have been put in.  It should have been referenced as 307, it was put in as 237, 
<br/>and so there was a mistake by the FRCS team.  But that is alright, we can, of course, correct that now 
<br/>and we have the opportunity to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, this is what this Bill seeks to do, Sir. If you look at the Bill itself, it does provide 
<br/>the citation for that with the concession code and we will see that reflected in the Bill itself. So, that 
<br/>is what we are seeking to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Does 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any Member wishes to take the floor?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  no  Member  wishes  to  take  the  floor,  I  will  call  upon  the  Attorney-General,  if  he  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anything further in his Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
