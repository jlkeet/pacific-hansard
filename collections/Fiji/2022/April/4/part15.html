<h3>VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) (NO. 2) BILL 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  
<br/>Parliament earlier today, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Value Added Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I call on the honourable Attorney-General, I 
<br/>remind you that pursuant to the resolution of Parliament, debate will be limited to one hour. This will 
<br/>also be the case for the next Bill that will follow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief, in the interest of time. 
<br/>However, as discussed in the introduction of this particular motion earlier on today, this essentially 
<br/></span><span>seeks to correct the coding numbers that were put incorrectly when we had approved this particular 
<br/></span><span>amendment during the Budget process.  This seeks to correct those particular codes as highlighted 
<br/>earlier on.  In practical terms, we have this implemented as was announced and as per the policy, 
<br/>obviously we need to ensure that it is in writing in the law, corrected, and therefore, the right codes 
<br/>need to be put in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that we are on the substantive 
<br/>matter, the proposed amendment to the Value Added Tax Act 1991, I would just like to reiterate the 
<br/>issue  that  I  had  drawn  earlier  because  the  debate  had  been  created  about  the  motive  behind  the 
<br/>objection to Standing Order 51 under the previous motion which the House had already voted upon.   
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take my guidance on your ruling earlier before we left in terms of the necessity 
<br/>of having to have this Bill tabled because the Schedule that was given to us had some incorrect data 
<br/>or figures on it, therefore, Parliament has to deal with it quickly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to say, Mr. Speaker, I mean that is a necessity but this would be the kind of Bill that 
<br/>Parliament would accept to come in under Standing Order 51 because it is necessary to have it come 
<br/>to the Parliament under Standing Order 51 </span><span>per se</span><span> because there is good reason for it. We have been, 
<br/>we do not object to Standing Order 51 unnecessarily for any reason.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, we are saying, we have been objecting 
<br/>to it because it has been abused as a process of bringing a Bill into Parliament by the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney General. It brings to light the story of the shepherd calling wolf. When the wolf actually did 
<br/>come, people did not react to it.  Why?  Because when Standing Order 51 is supposed to be used, it 
<br/>has already been used so many times before that we call it as an abuse of the parliamentary process.  
<br/>That is why the objection is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Parliament was allowed, we just use the process of the Money Bill under 
<br/>the Standing Orders that is provided for, then would have had a great opportunity to have a look at it 
<br/>and  matters  like  this,  Parliament  would  not  have  to  come  back  and  review,  or  the  honourable   
<br/>Attorney-General would not have to re-table an amendment Bill like this.  So, that was the reason for
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>944 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VAT (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the objection under Standing Order 51 but as you have said, this is a necessary amendment and it has 
<br/>come through and we support the amendment as proposed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to  have clarification on these types of 
<br/>corrections.  The honourable Minister has said that when something like this happens, he brings it to 
<br/>Parliament to be corrected, which is fine and he takes ownership of what went wrong.  But it takes 
<br/>us back to  the process  that we follow when he  brings  these  Bills to  Parliament.  I was asking my 
<br/>colleague, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, “what was the practice in other parliaments? Did 
<br/>this thing happen in the manner that we are seeing today?” He said, “No.  It did not happen in the 
<br/>manner that we are seeing today that if something goes wrong, the correction to the Bill comes into 
<br/>Parliament.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  know  that  he  is  taking  ownership  of  the  error  but  it  tells  us  that  the  process  we  are 
<br/>following is an abuse of the way Parliament works.  We just hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in the next 
<br/>budget, we do not have cases like this because it belittles Parliament where you bring something last 
<br/>week and you correct it the next day.  I tell you if this was in a company and the directors were treated 
<br/>in this manner, the CEO would be fired.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What he asked for, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this, go through the proper process so that you do not 
<br/></span><span>have these types of corrections brought into Parliament in this manner. The biggest danger here is 
<br/>that the people are watching and some have lost interest in this Parliament because the way FijiFirst 
<br/>runs the affairs of this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We must remember that in 2014, 19,000 people registered but did 
<br/>not vote and we had thought that it would have decreased by 2018, but it actually more than doubled.  
<br/>I know the weather was an inclement but a lot of people said, “We are tired of the way Parliament 
<br/>works, we do not really see ourselves being represented in the manner that we thought, that is why 
<br/>we are no longer interested in the affairs of Parliament.” That is a danger, Mr. Speaker, it affects the 
<br/>way people react to the democratic process in this country. You cannot be just using Standing Order 
<br/>51, you cannot just be using your majority to abuse Parliament in this manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  really  need  to  understand  how  we  really  should  work.  You  rush 
<br/>something into Parliament over one night.  Remember it was presented to us at about 9.00 p.m. or 
<br/>10.00 p.m. on Thursday evening and we were going to debate it on Friday morning - the whole Bill, 
<br/>plus a number of Consequential Bills that we did not have the time to debate on those Bills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to respect our people, they need to believe in this Parliament and 
<br/>right now the way FijiFirst is behaving, I would not be surprised if more people will not vote because 
<br/>they have lost faith in this Parliament. But I can tell you what, SODELPA will establish Parliament 
<br/>the way it should be running. You can be assured of that, not in this manner.  We will give you time 
<br/>to study the Bills, we will give you time to deliberate and not rushed in this manner, without shame 
<br/>and say, “Oh, we have a correction here.”  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they should be ashamed of the way they 
<br/>run Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua, who is  now supporting this particular  amendment  in  a very  convoluted manner.  As 
<br/>highlighted, I remember post-2014 when we first got elected, for the first budget, SODELPA actually 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Customs Tariff (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>945 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>walked out of the budget.  Honourable Tikoduadua used to sit next to me in those days, and very 
<br/>jubilantly we all approved the budget.  We went down to GPH, I still got the photograph to remind 
<br/>us of that where the budget was approved.  I remember before they did the walkout, I had pointed 
<br/>out to the Opposition then that previously under the previous Constitution and the SDL Government, 
<br/>et cetera, if you went through the budgetary debates and if you look at the amount of corrections that 
<br/>the Minister for Finance then used to make in the actual Budget Estimate figures, it was replete with 
<br/>mistakes.  The </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>will prove that to you.  And  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  had  nothing  substantial  to  say  about  the  Revised  Budget  last  week  and  here  we  are 
<br/>today, trying to capitalise in such a pathetic manner on these two codes that have been mistakenly 
<br/>put in by FRCS, we have taken responsibility for it and saying, “You should be ashamed of yourself” 
<br/>and here we are, we actually have the humility to say, “We take responsibility for it, there was a 
<br/>mistake and let us correct it.” It actually affects the various products that we said will go down to 
<br/>zero percent and that will go to 15 percent.  It is so pathetically cheap political grandstanding going 
<br/>on here on simply two codes, not going back into history, not actually being honest about it and not 
<br/>being able to point out how many other times have mistakes been made since 2014.  None!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tikoduadua earlier on said that t’s have not been crossed off, the i’s have not 
<br/></span><span>been dotted, there are no t’s or i’s in this particular Bill, it is only numbers, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Again, 
<br/></span><span>we are going through this whole charade of them trying to put up the show to object to everything 
<br/>that we do.  And here we are, Sir, trying to correct it so that ordinary Fijians, retailers, wholesalers, 
<br/>importers and manufacturers do not get confused by any of the coding numbers - that is all we are 
<br/>trying  to  do.    So  the  benefits  that  were  announced  in  the  Budget  can  be  rolled  out  without  any 
<br/>confusion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, there has been no confusion practically on the ground.  You go to supermarkets, from 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> April, the prices have come down by 9.0 percent.  You see every price tag being changed now to 
<br/>9  percent,  whichever  one  is  applicable.    So  here  we  are  just  trying  to  correct,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>formally  what  was  obviously  inadvertently  as  a  mistake.    It  went  from  FRCS to  us,  and  we  take 
<br/>responsibility for that.  To come out here and then use this to pontificate as they are  on some higher 
<br/>ground, as if no other  Governments  in  the past  have made these kind  of  mistakes, is really quite 
<br/>scurrilous.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all I have to say and I hope Parliament supports this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Value  Added  Tax  (Amendment)(No.  2)  Bill  2022  moved  under  Standing  Order  51  was 
<br/>passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.   (Act No. ……… of 2022)]
