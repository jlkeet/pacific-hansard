<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Energy Fiji Limited 
<br/></span><span>2019-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 
<br/>to  submit to  Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of Energy  Fiji  Limited  (EFL) 2019  and 
<br/>2020  Annual  Reports.    The  years  2019  and  2020  were  filled  with  its  own  unique  milestone  and 
<br/>challenges for Energy Fiji Limited.  As we are all aware, Fiji had its first COVID-19 case in 2020 
<br/>and like every other organisation, EFL too felt the brunt of its effect.  With international borders 
<br/>closing  and  the  tourism  industry  and  businesses  coming  to  a  standstill,  EFL  sales  declined 
<br/>significantly due to the drop in the demand for electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends EFL for achieving its financial profit of $66.79 million after tax 
<br/>in 2020 and compared to an audit profit after tax of $63.74 million in 2019 despite the odds.  The 
<br/>Committee lauds the great work carried out by EFL management and staff by keeping Fiji energised 
<br/>with managing assets over $1 billion on working 24/7 during national disasters while also working 
<br/>within the restriction posed due to COVID-19.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  deliberating  on  the  report,  it  was  evident  that  EFL  had  been  continuously  working 
<br/>towards ensuring ease of access to their service by wide range of customers.  The EFL’s presence 
<br/>and service are available in the four main islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. 
<br/>Most of their customers are on Post Pay services for logistical convenience, domestic customers in 
<br/>the rural remote areas are on pre-pay service as it is more economical for both customers and EFL.  
<br/>Sir,  EFL  had  used  various  digital  platforms  to  ensure  that  customers  are  able  to  pay  their  bills 
<br/>conveniently  through  services  such  as  M-PAiSA,  Digi  Mobile  Wallet,  internet  banking  and 
<br/>Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that the world is moving towards digital technology, such initiatives are welcomed. 
<br/>Furthermore, the Committee is very pleased to note that COVID-19 did not hinder EFL’s ability to 
<br/>enhance the skills and knowledge of their staff as training continued to run virtually in 2020 despite 
<br/>the various limitations. In fact, EFL in association with JICA conducted two sessions of Regional 
<br/>Training on Solar via online platform in March and November 2020 with 18 participants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  EFL  in  collaboration  with  the  Fijian  Government,  under  the 
<br/>COVID-19 Economics Stimulus committed to assist low income households by providing a subsidy 
<br/>towards the payment of monthly electricity bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced  this  Report  -  honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable  George 
<br/>Vegnathan, honourable Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Filipe Tuisawau. On behalf of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Consolidated Review Report on the Energy Fiji 
<br/>Limited 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports to Parliament.

<div><span>Review Report - Compliance Audit Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Report provides the Committee review findings on 
<br/>the Report of the Auditor-General of the Republic of Fiji on the Compliance Audit Report. The Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General (OAG) was established as an Independent Office by the Constitution of the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The function of the OAG is to conduct audits to determine whether an entity is achieving its 
<br/>objective  in  compliance  with  relevant  legislations.  These  audits  are  carried  out  by  the  Auditor-
<br/>General  on  behalf  of  Parliament.  In  this  regard,  the  Auditor-General  must  submit  a  report  on 
<br/>compliance audits carried out to Parliament. In addition, a single report may include two or more 
<br/>audits.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Compliance Audit that was conducted were focused on line agencies that were involved 
<br/>and how each entity could complied with the relevant legislations, policies and procedures that were 
<br/>in  place.  In  addition,  the  Audit  also  identified  gaps  and  areas  that  needed  to  be  addressed  and 
<br/>strengthened.

<br/>importantly, implement the relevant recommendations that are put forward to enhance the service 
<br/>delivery for each entity. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>written responses to the audit issues that were raised on each audit topic and the measures that are in
