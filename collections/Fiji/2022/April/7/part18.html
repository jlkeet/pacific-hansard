<div><span>CT Scan Services - Western Division 
<br/>(Question No. 80/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament of 
<br/>the alternatives available to patients in the Western Division who need CT scan services given 
<br/>the absence of a working CT scanner at the Lautoka Hospital? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  that  question. 
<br/>Currently at the moment the CT scan services in Lautoka Hospital is outsourced to Zens Medical 
<br/>Centre and from August 2021 to February 2022, we had referred 686 patients for CT scan. This has 
<br/>happened because as I have alluded to previously in Parliament, Mr. Speaker, was that the CT scan 
<br/>in Lautoka is not functioning and we are in the process of replacing it with a $1.5 million CT scan 
<br/></span><span>top of the range which is coming through a grant from Japan.  This is in addition to the CT scans that 
<br/></span><span>we are also getting for CWM Hospital and Labasa Hospital that are going through the tender process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Aspen has committed to putting in a temporary CT scan in May this year 
<br/>that will carry us through to when the CT scan from Japan arrives in August, but I want to make a 
<br/>point at this juncture that doing a CT scan is not a simple decision to do because with a CT scan, it 
<br/>is  equivalent  to  doing  400  chest  x-rays,  the  amount  of  radiation  that  a  CT  scan  gives.    The 
<br/>International Atomic Energy have indicated that in young people it is important to make the right 
<br/>decision about CT scan because giving frequent CT scans has been shown to have an increased risk 
<br/>of cancer because of radiation later on in life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also recently repaired as of last year the Radiology Department at 
<br/>Lautoka Hospital  to  a tune of $1.5 million.    Including in  that is we have installed a $302,295.89 
<br/>Floor-Mounted Shimadzu Digital X-Ray which is top of the range.  So, this digital x-ray also gives 
<br/>really good images in which some of the patients would actually get a CT scan before would not 
<br/>because this top of the range x-ray machine does.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1101 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also purchased ultrasound scans HS79A Samsung Maddison Quality Scan costing 
<br/>$267,502 and this supports the use of imaging in this rather than specifically to CT scan.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, there are also cases that not necessarily require a CT scan and they come directly in Haven MRI.  
<br/>A case in point is a case this week that last week or few weeks before had an MRI, had a head tumour 
<br/>and was actually being  operated  with  our neurosurgeon using their new  state of the art $672,000 
<br/>operating digital microscope that Government had also procured. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion I would like to say that at the moment we have the avenues 
<br/>to be able to provide other imaging apart from CT scan which is outsourced to Zens which is the 
<br/>digital general mounted x-ray and the digital x-rays that we have and also the sophisticated ultrasound 
<br/>machine that we are using.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  follow-up  question  for  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, would the Minister then clarify with those who 
<br/>are having to be sent to Zens Medical Clinic because of the inability of the public health system to 
<br/>provide CT scans, are the patients paying for those CT scans when they go to a private provider or 
<br/>not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Sir, all those patients that come through the public system, 
<br/></span><span>in which our specialists have agreed that they need a CT scan and the numbers that I have alluded to 
<br/>before which is 686 patients from August 2021 to February 2022, we paid $297,340, they did not 
<br/>pay a cent if they came through our system with our specialists actually requesting a CT scan.  If the 
<br/>patient came from private straight to Zens Medical Centre, then that is a private referral.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Meteorological Services Current &amp; Future Plans 
<br/>(Question No. 81/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  changing  weather  patterns,  can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament 
<br/>on the current and future plans of the Fiji Meteorological Service to enhance weather and 
<br/>flood forecasting?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  in  response  to  the  question  asked  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Virendra Lal and thank him for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By way of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the data is now showing and I think we are all 
<br/>aware in this House and also in our country that weather patterns are changing.  We are seeing the 
<br/>increase in the temperatures of our seas, we have seen as a result of that the increase in the intensity 
<br/>of the tropical cyclones, the intense rainfall, the increased rainfall and also the large storm surges that 
<br/>are impacting on our coast lines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Southwest Pacific region, it has been noted lately that at least one 
<br/>category-five tropical cyclone was observed every tropical cyclone season since 2013-2014 with the 
<br/>exception of the 2018-2019 tropical cyclone season.  This is a new trend and it is very alarming.  For 
<br/>Fiji, it has been noted that most of the severe tropical cyclones occurred from the period of 2010 to 
<br/>2021.  There were more occurrences of categories three, four and five tropical cyclones during this 
<br/>period.  Also, Fiji experienced back-to-back cyclones during this period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of rainfall, there is a year-to-year variability in Fijiâ€™s rainfall, a 
<br/>number of heavy rainfall and flood events have occurred especially during </span><span>La Nina</span><span> years but on the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other hand when you have an </span><span>El Nino</span><span> year, this is normally associated with dry spells and droughts.  
<br/>With this data, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need to improve our weather and flood forecasting cannot be 
<br/>overstated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  years  the  Department  of  Meteorological  Services  has  been 
<br/>committed  to  improving  its  forecasting  capabilities  by  upgrading  of  its  reporting  and  network 
<br/>facilities and meeting regional and international obligations.  This includes, for example, the upgrade 
<br/>of  the  Nadi  radar  antenna,  the  replacement  of  our  automatic  weather  observation  system  at  Nadi 
<br/>Airport, the installation of water level and rainfall telemetry instruments, the upgrade of our outer 
<br/>island stations and upgrade of our meteorological facilities to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recently  the  Fiji  Meteorological  has  changed  its  vision  to  be  a  people-
<br/>focused centre of excellence for weather, climate, hydrological and ocean services, a paradigm shift 
<br/>that focuses on communities needs and works towards addressing them all through the service that it 
<br/>provides.  Some of the future developments by the Department of Meteorological Service is firstly 
<br/>the move towards impact-based forecasting.  The traditional way of weather prediction is to tell us 
<br/>what the weather will be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Impact-based forecasting will tell us what the weather will do.  It is a structured approach of 
<br/></span><span>combining  hazard  exposure  and  vulnerability  data  to  identify  risk  and  support  decision-making.  
<br/>Generating impact-based products will require a range of specialists to work together.  In this regard, 
<br/>the Fiji Meteorological is working with the National Disaster Management Office and the Weather 
<br/>Readiness Project Team from the United States of America to develop an impact-based forecasting 
<br/>system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly  is  the  upscaling  of  our  coastal  inundation  forecasting  system.    This  is  to  enable 
<br/>efficient warning systems to protect coastal communities and support sustainable development.  In 
<br/>2020,  a  coastal  inundation  forecasting  demonstration  project  was  developed  and  successfully 
<br/>implemented with the assistance from the World Meteorological Organisation.  The aim of the project 
<br/>was to develop a higher-resolution wave forecast model including ocean observational data.  Building 
<br/>upon the lessons and recommendations of the demonstration project, the plan is to further expand 
<br/>this with a focus on building resilience of end-users and industries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the upscaling of the Fiji Flash Flood Guidance System.  Our current system provides 
<br/>guidance information on the risk of flash floods near the catchment areas.  The plan now is to further 
<br/>develop the system to enhance the quality and the lead time for early warning of flash flooding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  improved  access  to  hydrometeorological  data  and 
<br/>information.  The demand for hydrometeorological data and information is very high. There are two 
<br/>things here â€“ one is to access the data and the other is the ability to interpret that data.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  make  it  user-friendly,  the  Department  is  working  towards  consolidating  all  incoming 
<br/>operational  weather,  climate  and  water  observation  data,  satellite  and  radar  imagery  in  a  single 
<br/>quality-controlled database.  That database will feed to the web interface for external client to access 
<br/>to real-time hydrometeorological data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will move to the third Oral Question for today.  
<br/>This question was originally for the honourable Niko Nawaikula to ask and because he is otherwise 
<br/>engaged  today,  the  honourable  Ratu  Tevita  Navurelevu  was  to  ask  the  question.    Unfortunately, 
<br/>however, he is taken sick and I have allowed for the honourable Inosi Kuridrani to ask the question.

<div><span>Utilisation of Climate Action Trust Fund 
<br/>(Question No. 82/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the status 
<br/>of utilisation of the Climate Action Trust Fund? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  in  the  interest  of  time,  I  would  like  to  highlight  to  Parliament  that  we  have  already 
<br/>presented the Audited Financial Annual Reports for the  years 2016- 2017, 2017-2018; t the three 
<br/>Semi-Annual Reports 1, 2 and 3, which I have here in my hand and have already been tabled and the 
<br/>fourth one, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is currently being audited which is also in my hand.  The 
<br/>honourable Member, if that is what he means by the update on the status of utilisation, you will get 
<br/>all of that from the audited accounts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Teachers Helpline 
<br/>(Question No. 83/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Local 
<br/>Government  update Parliament on the Teachers  Helpline which was  launched on 22</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/>February, 2022? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with close to 13,000 teachers employed by the Ministry, it is important that 
<br/>we  improve  our  services  for  our  teachers.    The  Teachers  Helpline  has  been  developed  to  allow 
<br/>teachers to register their complaints and issues related to their employment or workplace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, teachers raised their concerns and issues via phone calls, letters, 
<br/>e-mails or by visiting Headquarters.  This platform was developed to improve customer service at 
<br/></span><span>the  Ministry.    The  Teacher  Helpline  was  developed  by  the  Ministryâ€™s  IT  Unit  without  any  cost.  
<br/></span><span>Similar support system is used in Australia and New Zealand where teachers can contact the Ministry 
<br/>through online platforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Teacher Helpline portal was launched on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> February, 2022.  Teachers 
<br/>accessed the Helpline using the same credential they use to log into the FEMIS. Using FEMIS portal 
<br/>ensures that the communication is kept confidential.  Teachers can log on to the portal with the click 
<br/>of a button, even from the comfort of their homes, and choose from a dropdown menu to lodge their 
<br/>complaints.  They can also upload evidence to support the issue on hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through three simple steps, teachers can lodge their complaints.  First, they 
<br/>can provide a brief description of the concern, confirm that the information provided is correct, and 
<br/>finally upload any document or evidence that the teacher feels is relevant to the issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This portal is our commitment to the teachers to deal with teacher issues, such as salaries, 
<br/>appointments, teaching loads, contracts, transfers, to name a few.  We have also provided a mobile

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>number to assist those teachers who are based in remote and maritime locations where connectivity 
<br/>can be an issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  this  platform,  we  can  address  issues  better  and  provide  feedback 
<br/>systematically.  All feedbacks and concerns are tracked through a single channel, allowing teachers 
<br/>to check on the progress, while allowing the Ministry to provide a coordinated response. There is a 
<br/>dedicated team that looks after the Teacher Helpline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To date, we have already resolved more than 80 grievances, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The turnaround 
<br/>time to address the issue is five working days, but I am happy to say that so far, our team has been 
<br/>able  to  resolve  and  assist  teachers  well  before  five  days.  We  are  in  the  process  of  creating  more 
<br/>awareness to assist teachers across the country to use the Teacher Helpline where teachers can track 
<br/>the progress of their complaints and after the awareness raising, that would be the only portal where 
<br/>teachers  can  lodge  their  complaints  because  we  want  to  store  all  those  complaints  because  those 
<br/>complaints will provide feedback and through this feedback, we can improve our policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government recognises the importance of education in nation 
<br/>building. We do not only support educational needs of our students, but also empower teachers to 
<br/></span><span>raise their issues directly with the Ministry.  That is why the Teacher Helpline was developed, to 
<br/></span><span>handle teacher complaints in a professional manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lautoka Market Ventilation and Light Project 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 84/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.A.R SENILOLI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government  update  Parliament  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Lautoka  Market 
<br/>Ventilation and Light Project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  asked  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The municipal markets create economic activities, generate income for the vendors and the 
<br/>Council  and,  therefore,  it  is  an  important  facility  for  the  Municipal  Councils  to  look  after.  The 
<br/>Lautoka City Council continues to address the issues raised by the market vendors to improve the 
<br/></span><span>market facility wherever appropriate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Lautoka Municipal Market has three structures which consists of the 
<br/>main market, the bus station market and the new wing market. The main market is the largest building 
<br/>and is a hall-type structure which houses the fish market, root crops, vegetables, fruits and handicraft 
<br/>stalls. The bus station market is currently accommodating the Kava sellers with spice vendors.  The 
<br/>new market shed is similar to the main market with the roof, but retains an open air circulation. All 
<br/>three markets have a total of 2,135 vendors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the implementation of the Lautoka Market Ventilation and 
<br/>Light Project, the Council in 2019, recruited a consultant to carry out consultation, and provide an 
<br/>appropriate concept design to improve the Market lightening and ventilation. Sir, the consultantâ€™s 
<br/>scope is to consider a go-green building concept for natural ventilation and lighting, to take advantage 
<br/>of the sunny weather experienced throughout the year and to use solar energy where possible.  The 
<br/>intention is to save energy consumption and reduce operational costs in the form of electricity.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1105 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  total  project  cost,  including  consultancy,  is  estimated  to  be  $2.4  million,  with 
<br/>implementation  schedule  of  six  monthsâ€™  construction  to  complete  the  works.    However,  due  to 
<br/>COVID-19, this project was put on hold. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Lautoka  City  Council,  in  the  interim,  provided  more  lighting  and 
<br/>ventilation.  For example, they have installed industrial fans, tube lights, downlights, and they have 
<br/>also provided seven tarpaulins.  All this was done by the Council to improve the market facility for 
<br/>the market vendors and the customers.  The total cost of the installation of the lights and provision 
<br/>of tarpaulin is in the sum of $22,205. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Council has also installed CCTV cameras around and inside the market.  
<br/>This  is  to  ensure  that  the  market  facility  offer  security  to  the  vendors  and  the  public.  There  are 
<br/>altogether 16 CCTV cameras installed in the market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- A market-related question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We are getting request 
<br/>from villagers when fruits are in season, they bring their fruits to shopping complexes and they sell 
<br/>them at verandas, and they have been chased away. We are asking, what can Government do for them 
<br/>during the short period when fruits are in season?  They come to shopping complexes and verandas, 
<br/></span><span>instead of being chased away, what can the Government do to accommodate them?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It cannot be a supplementary question, Mr Speaker, Sir. It is not related 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to that question at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- You talk about  vendors, you are talking aboutâ€¦. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, I am talking about Lautoka Market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A supplementary question is supposed to be related to the subject matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a different question altogether.  We will move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Drainage Works 
<br/>(Question No. 85/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment update 
<br/></span><span>Parliament on drainage works done this year around Fiji to support the agriculture sector 
<br/></span><span>and protect communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank honourable Vegnathan for asking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to take you back. The Ministry of Waterways was established by the 
<br/>Government in the recognition of the fact that the management of waterways, the preservation of 
<br/>Fijiâ€™s pristine environment and support for agriculture is quite critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is to provide support to its people, secure our biodiversity from 
<br/>flooding  through  drainage  improvement  works,  for  farmlands  and  rural  residential  areas.  The 
<br/>Ministry  has  already  undertaken  this  project  in  areas  that  have  been  facing  floods  and  is  still 
<br/>committed to the provision of drainage improvement works around the Central Division, Western 
<br/>Division, Northern Division and Eastern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="98">Page 98</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry receives a lot of requests from farmers and rural communities, 
<br/>which  are  in  need  to  be  looked  after  at  times,  especially  during  the  rainy  seasons.    The  drainage 
<br/>improvement works will technically construct pathways, including widening and deepening of all 
<br/>drains, creeks, to provide them with the varying capacity and stability of water flowing.  Also, it is 
<br/>to deal with issues of flooding in areas where we do not have any drain and there is need to establish 
<br/>new drains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry was allocated half a million dollars towards this Drainage for 
<br/>Farmlands Programme in the 2021-2022 National Budget.   So far, we have committed $435,952, 
<br/>nearly almost all of that fund out of the total budget allocated.  The funds have been used to assist 
<br/>close to 1,400 farmers in the Central Division, 715 farmers in the Western Division and 440 farmers 
<br/>in the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  includes  a  total  length  of  227,806  metres  of  drainage  work.    The 
<br/>Ministry was allocated half a million dollars towards its drainage for rural residential in the 2021-
<br/>2022 National Budget.  The Ministry so far assisted approximately 2,000 households in the Central 
<br/>Division, 2,700 households in the Western Division and 409 households in the Northern Division.  
<br/>The  total  length  of  work  carried  out  is  approximately  185,738  metres.    The  Ministry  has  so  far 
<br/></span><span>committed $418,563 out of the half a million dollars allocated.  So almost all the funds have been 
<br/></span><span>utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been supporting farmers and rural households in the vision 
<br/>to boost their agricultural production and attain economic benefits.  This is also in line with one of 
<br/>the budgetary themes about two years ago of protecting communities, protecting rural households.  
<br/>Flooding  has  been  always  been  an  issue  for  the  rural  residential  farmers.    Before,  there  was  no 
<br/>allocation to undertake drainage work for rural residential communities.  There was only allocation 
<br/>which was also funded by farmers under the old drainage Land and Water Resource Management 
<br/>(LWRM)  scheme.    So  there  were  designated  LWRM  drains  and  the  farmers  were  making 
<br/>contributions for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, about three years ago, this Government removed that contribution and took 
<br/>over  the  entire  drainage  work  to  be  fully  funded  by  the  Government.    In  addition  to  that,  this 
<br/>Government took over establishing drains outside the established LWRM drains.  In addition to that, 
<br/>this  Government  has  taken  over  and  provided  additional  resources  to  assist  villages  and  rural 
<br/>residential areas to protect them from flooding by constructing drains wherever there is a need for.  I 
<br/>urge the community members taking this opportunity not  to  throw litter in  the drains,  protect  the 
<br/></span><span>drains and it is very important that we protect the waterways and keep it clear so that water can flow 
<br/></span><span>out.  We would want to continue to protect our communities from any flooding issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this year we commissioned the desilting of 
<br/>the Vitogo River, and we are still waiting.  May I ask the honourable Minister, when will the actual 
<br/>work start?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we commissioned and the work has started and 
<br/>the honourable Member was there with me.  Then later on there was  an issue of another licensee 
<br/>being given the license by the Ministry of Lands.  We are now contacting that particular person who 
<br/>is holding the license to whatever area that that contractor has got, they need to clear it.  The person 
<br/>whom we have engaged on a PPP model will open up the river mouth.  We are now in talks with that 
<br/>person who is undertaking that work on a commercial basis.  He knows that.

<div><span>Update on Visitor Arrivals and Forward Bookings 
<br/>(Question No. 87/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government,a upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development Minister inform Parliament of the 
<br/>latest  update  on  visitor  arrivals  and  forward  bookings  after  the  reopening  of  international 
<br/>borders and its impact on the economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  we  talk  about  the  impact  of  the 
<br/>economy with the reopening of the borders, I think we have to understand what actually happened to 
<br/>the economy with the closure of the borders.  As we know that prior to COVID-19, the tourism sector 
<br/>contributed about $2 billion a year in foreign exchanged earnings for us, but of course, due to the 
<br/>COVID-19 over 100,000 people lost their jobs and we saw visitor number drop significantly.  A drop 
<br/>to negative 83.5 percent in 2020 and further dropped to 78.5 percent in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism  earnings,  of  course,  declined  significantly  during  this  period,  Sir,  to  only  $340.9 
<br/></span><span>million in 2020 and $36.5 million in 2021.  We lost overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about $4 billion in 
<br/></span><span>tourism earnings over the past two years.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore the vaccination rate of Fiji and 
<br/>the drive towards vaccination,  No Jab, No Job Policy, et cetera, helped us very quickly reach that 
<br/>level of vaccination that actually helped us to open up the borders from the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of December. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have now seen the numbers actually creep back up.  The numbers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after 
<br/>the 1</span><span>st</span><span> December was, visitor arrivals was noted a significant increase where 23,226 visitors were 
<br/>recorded for the month of December of which 77.1 percent were Australians, 15.1 percent from the 
<br/>USA and the rest  from  other source destinations.   In January 2022, Sir,  a total of 16,502 visitors 
<br/>arrived and for February we recorded 11,014 visitors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  forecast  for  March,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  stood  at  around  15,300  visitor  arrivals.    From 
<br/>December  2021  to  February  2022,  a  total  of  50,742  visitors  arrived  onto  the  Fijian  shores,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, registering a 17 percent increase in the last three months visitor arrivals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of this, Sir, again, as I highlighted, 84 percent came for holidays, which is about 42,398; 9.0 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent which is about 4, 573 came to visit their friends and relatives, 2 percent came for business 
<br/>reasons and 5 percent or 2,764 came for other reasons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the highest number of visitor arrivals as highlighted earlier on came from 
<br/>Australia from December 2021 to February 2022, this is followed by USA, 6,671 or 13.1 percent and 
<br/>8.3 percent or 4,189 are from other countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the countries, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, included: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hong Kong; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>India; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>South Korea; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Japan; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>United Kingdom; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Continental Europe; 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Pacific Island countries; 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>China; and 
<br/>9.</span><span> </span><span>Canada.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the outlook, we are expecting in 2022 overall, the total visitor 
<br/>arrivals to grow by about 1,314 percent.  Of course it is that high because we had only 34,000 visitors 
<br/>last year, which started from a very lower base. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  expect  447,000  visitors  to  come  to  Fiji.  The  ANZ  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  which  is 
<br/>available publically, a lot more bullish in their projections.  They expect 600,000 visitors to come to 
<br/>Fiji. We hope that they are right and we are wrong, Sir, and again we expect the total visitor arrivals 
<br/>in 2024 to go back to pre-pandemic levels, so another two years of being below pre-pandemic levels.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, forward monthly tourist booking until July has exceeded our earlier expectations 
<br/>and visitor arrivals are expected to surpass our current projections much sooner than expected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism Fiji expects around 129,804 visitors between April to July of this year because we 
<br/>will approach the peak season with many visitors flocking to our shores for holidays in the coming 
<br/>months, Sir. Of course, this has led to a great sense of optimism, in particular, with the hotel industry 
<br/>in the tourism sector overall.   April so far, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to be our biggest month yet 
<br/>for arrivals when we are expecting between 30,000 and 35,000 visitors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent relaxation of travel restrictions or requirements by New Zealand which used to be 
<br/></span><span>our second largest source market is also expected to boost arrivals. Recent news indicate that the 
<br/></span><span>level of bookings for international travel insurance among New Zealanders is incredibly strong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The New Zealand based Southern Cross Travel Insurance Agency reported a 2,000 percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase in travel insurance bookings recently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also expect further increases from the following markets: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Europe; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Asia; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Middle East ; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>South Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding Fiji Airways, Sir, travel bookings look greatly optimistic for Fiji Airways which 
<br/>is about 10 percent lower than the level in 2019 which is actually pretty good. If you are 10 percent 
<br/>lower, only 10 percent lower than 2019 numbers.  Still a significant growth for us, given in particular 
<br/>that Fiji Airways was hardly flying in 2020 and 2021.  The travel bookings on average is also growing 
<br/>at an encouraging rate of 10 percent pace every week.  For Australia the bookings are on a steady 
<br/></span><span>growth and it is sitting at 21 percent above the 2019 for the next six months which is great news for 
<br/></span><span>us.  For New Zealand, whilst the border has just opened, the travel bookings to Fiji are growing at a 
<br/>weekly rate of 33 percent with new bookings trending positively over 100 percent versus 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  USA,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  travel  bookings  with  the  airline  are  currently  below  2019 
<br/>levels by around 30 percent.  However, the rate of new booking is encouraging and growing at the 
<br/>rate of around 10 percent on a weekly basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the Asian route, Fiji Airways is only flying to Singapore at this point in time, we are 
<br/>not flying to Hong Kong not flying to Narita.  It is only Singapore and in fact in the low season we 
<br/>are only flying once every fortnight.  That will, of course, pick up should the numbers increase.  As 
<br/>we know Hong Kong is under a very severe lockdown given what is happening in mainland China. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know that the current recovery of the Fijian economy is very much 
<br/>still  dependent  on  the  tourism  sector,  whilst  government  has  been  over  the  past  number  of  years 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1109 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trying  to  diversify  our  economic  base,  economic  risk  factor,  of  course,  we  are  still  fairly  heavily 
<br/>dependent on the tourism sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year we expect the Fijian economy to rebound by 11.3 percent, largely dependent on the 
<br/>assumption  of  the  447,195  tourist,  honourable  Gavoka  may  find  this  amusing.    It  is  not  amusing 
<br/>because last year we had only 34,000 tourists so obviously if it is going to go up 447,000, that means 
<br/>a huge increase and that is why we are predicting a rebound of 11 percent.  Sir, ANZ is predicting 
<br/>over 20 percent, again we hope ANZ is actually correct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot more people are returning to their jobs, a lot more people we are seeing 
<br/>in the hotel sector are returning to their jobs.  I was at the  Fijian Hotel a couple of weeks ago, just 
<br/>talking to people who are the lifeguards at the childrenâ€™s swim park out in the sea, a lot of them are 
<br/>actually working, instead of the adult side, they are now working six days a week. Some people on 
<br/>the other side are working four days or five days a week.  So, with the numbers increasing, they will 
<br/>actually go back to full time work and some are already working six days a week depending which 
<br/>segment in the hotel sector they are in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, overall, of course as we highlighted that we continue to diversify our economy, as the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister highlighted earlier today, was that one of the BPOs has opened in Fiji.  
<br/></span><span>They started off with only about 10 jobs in the year before last, they now have about 70-80 jobs in 
<br/>that  company  alone.    It  has  grown  to  3,000  jobs  overall  in  the  BPO  sector.    We  obviously  are 
<br/>providing support to that, so apart from the tourism sector, we are focusing on a number of other 
<br/>areas  and  with  the  passing  of  the  Investment  Fiji  Act  today  by  Parliament  coupling  with  the 
<br/>Investment Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we hope that we will be able to diversify more and of course get 
<br/>more investment overall in the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in times of uncertainty, historically our neighbours, 
<br/>the Australians and New Zealanders do not travel far, they travel close and Fiji benefits from it. I 
<br/>believe that will happen again this year with the war, et cetera.  The question is, are we sure that the 
<br/>airline serving Fiji from Australia and New Zealand are committed to providing services this year?  
<br/>Qantas, Virgin Airways and Air New Zealand, are we sure that their commitment is here with the 
<br/>airlines? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  I  most  definitely  cannot  speak  on  behalf  of  Virgin 
<br/>Airways or Qantas or Jet Star but I most certainly can speak on behalf of Fiji Airways which is the 
<br/>national carrier and most definitely Fiji Airways is committed to flying to Australia and destinations 
<br/></span><span>and indeed increase the frequency if required if the number of bookings increase.  So, Fiji Airways 
<br/></span><span>is the one that will continue to fly Sir.
