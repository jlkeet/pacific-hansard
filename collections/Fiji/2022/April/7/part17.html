<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSESOF POVERTY – STANDING COMMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES 
<br/>OF POVERTY – STANDING COMMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, child poverty in Fiji is evident throughout 
<br/>the rural areas.  The United Nations released the report that displays Rural Child Poverty rate at 40.92 
<br/>percent, almost double urban rates of 22.22 percent.  The extent of this discrepancy between those 
<br/>living in rural and urban areas is clear.  There is a similar difference in the ages of those experiencing 
<br/>poverty in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The United Nations Report highlights that 32.1 percent of children younger than the age of 
<br/>14 experience poverty.    We see this  young  children, Mr. Speaker, outside supermarkets,  Cost-U-
<br/>Less,  services  stations,  Damodar  City,  traffic  lights  either  selling  to  support  family  income  or 
<br/>begging. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, has an unparalleled effect on young children in rural areas.  This 
<br/>has led to a stunting rate tallied at 7.5 percent amongst infants and young children in 2004. Infant 
<br/></span><span>and young children are not the only ones affected by malnourishment as 22 percent of adolescence 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji were underweight as of 2005.  Because of this, young children are increasingly affected by 
<br/>Rheumatic Heart Disease, NCDs and other child-related illnesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  clear  connection  between  poverty,  geography  and 
<br/>education. According to the 2019/2020 HIES Report, the areas that were most affected by poverty 
<br/>were the northern rural areas and remote maritime zones.  Fiji’s remote location impacts the price of 
<br/>uniforms, books and transportation. Although education is free up to the second level, the secondary 
<br/>costs of education present additional barriers for children living in poverty.  Even if rural families 
<br/>scrape  together  money  for  their  children’s  education,  difficult  road  conditions  and  costly  sea 
<br/>transportation prevent easy accessibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, children do not receive consistent protection against violation and abuse.  Many 
<br/>children  faced  domestic  or  sexual  violence.  Sometimes  this  adds  to  lifelong  difficulties  for  these 
<br/>people, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Authorities under report these conditions and often times local authorities 
<br/>dismiss the crimes with little supervision from the countries policing system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those villages, settlements including informal settlements, who have head 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of households with education below the secondary level are at greater risk of poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A significant percentage of individuals in Fiji did not attend secondary school due to a lack 
<br/>of  income.    According  to  the  Save  the  Children  Fund  Fiji  Report  of  1998,  65  percent  of  school 
<br/>dropouts are directly linked to poverty.  Unemployment, high cost of living and other related issues 
<br/>like COVID-19 forced many families to stop sending their children to school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  many  of  the  schools  are  in  poor  conditions  and  in  need  of  basic  materials.  
<br/>Nonetheless, in 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government announced universal free access to primary 
<br/>and secondary education for all children, hoping to lower the rate of school dropouts.  However, with 
<br/>no Annual Report from the Ministry of Education since 2017, it is difficult to gauge just how effective 
<br/>these policies have been. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  low  income  is  a  strong  predictor  of  low  educational 
<br/>performance.  Poverty is the number one enemy of education on every level.  Poor students not only 
<br/>receive the worst education but they fall victim to lifestyle and health issues that hinder their ability

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to learn.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore poverty, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a hard cycle that become more and more difficult to 
<br/>get out of, especially when the education levels are not the same for low income families.  The onus 
<br/>then is on Government to provide a targeted education system that will ensure that all children are 
<br/>educated to the best of their ability and where according to the Government mantra, where no child 
<br/>is left behind.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to the debate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the motion by honourable Professor Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yet again, the other side of the House and specifically, honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad, has come up with a motion like the one before us which, I suppose, he thinks will win him 
<br/>some  extra  votes.    For  the  benefit  of  Fijians  watching,  what  is  being  asked  by  the  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament is that, a special committee - a committee that will tell us what causes poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Standing Committee not Special Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Now, he likes splitting hairs, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Be  that  as  it  may  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  does  not  solve  anything.    We  can  actually  see 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ignorance of this particular motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians have seen and lived through one of our most trying times in Fijian 
<br/>history in the past two years.  If the honourable Member has forgotten, I would like to remind him 
<br/>that the entire world was devastated by a pandemic, a pandemic that the world is not quite yet rid of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we may sound like a broken record, if he may say, but lest we forget that the 
<br/>pandemic wiped out 40 percent of the Fijian GDP.  What this means, Sir, is that those employed in 
<br/>the critical sectors such as tourism, instantly lost their jobs and this, honourable Professor Prasad, 
<br/>means they lost their livelihood and their ability to continue supporting their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as usual the Fijian Government did not let them suffer due to this external 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, Hear!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We immediately worked on a COVID package for those who had lost 
<br/>their jobs and today, more than two years on, when we are showing serious signs of a recovery, we 
<br/>have  such  a  motion  being  tabled.    What  we  are  doing  is,  we  are  supporting  and  we  are  actually 
<br/>sustaining local businesses to ensure that our economy remains resilient from within. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me take the honourable Member back to pre-COVID Fiji, a Fiji that was 
<br/>growing for nine consecutive years, a Fiji that was built and I say this very proudly, a Fiji that was 
<br/>built on inclusivity and ensuring that no one was left behind.  Not only national data but the World 
<br/>Bank  Group  confirmed  that  in  2019,  Fiji’s  unemployment  rate  was  around  4.5  percent  which 
<br/>increased to 4.7 percent and that was due to obvious reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  ADB  has  noted  Fiji’s  poverty  rate  is  approximately  29.9  percent, 
<br/>contrary to what has been bended about by the Opposition this afternoon which is a massive drop 
<br/>compared to 20 years ago or 43.3 percent in 2002.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pre-COVID-19 we saw new industries emerging and existing industries strengthening their 
<br/>position,  Mr.  Speaker.    In  fact,  the  targeted  interventions  by  the  Fijian  Government  enabled  the 
<br/>creation of a middle-income class in  Fiji.  These are people who have actively contributed to the 
<br/>Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister responsible for MSME development, I am proud to say that 
<br/>the  Ministry  has  provided  support  to  Fijians  who  actually  go  into  business.    We  have  invested 
<br/>approximately  $103  million  in  MSMEs  through  programmes,  such  as  micro  and  small  business 
<br/>grants,  concessional  loans,  continued  grant  assistance  programmes  such  as  the  Integrated  Human 
<br/>Resource  Development  Programme  (IHRDP),  the  Northern  Development  Programme  (NDP),  the 
<br/>National Export Strategy (NES) and the Young Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  also  revived  and  modernised  the  co-operative  business  model  to 
<br/>encourage Fijians to pull their resources and make commercially viable business ventures.  Today, 
<br/>we have more than 400 operating co-operatives in all Divisions across Fiji and they hold currently, 
<br/>$133 million in assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most recently announced Trade Enhancement Programme (TEP) aims 
<br/></span><span>to assist trade-based MSMEs through a $500 funding and a total of $500,000 has been allocated, 
<br/></span><span>which will enable mini capital funding to 1,000 promising applicants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme will actually create employment opportunities for those who 
<br/>have lost their jobs due to COVID-19, encourage the movement from informal to formal sector and 
<br/>create the opportunity to create training awareness on financial literacy, encourage youth, encourage 
<br/>women and persons with disability, entrepreneurship and enhanced provision of services from the 
<br/>trade sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the budget-related initiatives, the Government has in place 
<br/>poverty  benefit  schemes  administered  through  the  Ministry  of  Women  and  Poverty  Alleviation 
<br/>which,  in  this  financial  year,  will  assist  more  than  23,000  households.    We  have  heard  from  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation,  we  have  heard  from  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Defence,  National  Security  and  Policing,  so  I  suggest  that  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad should actually withdraw his motion after two of those very wonderful speeches 
<br/>basically told everything that was needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other  recent  initiatives,  as  announced  in  the  Revised  Budget,  will  allow  Fijians  to  earn  a 
<br/></span><span>decent income through the regularisation of home-based businesses, such as canteens and catering 
<br/></span><span>and tailoring, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the national minimum wage has been reviewed and a gradual approach to 
<br/>increasing the minimum threshold has begun. This Government has done more to address poverty-
<br/>related issues over the years than any other government before it.  We have innovative livelihood 
<br/>programmes,  infrastructure  development,  connecting  villages  to  urban  areas,  provision  of  clean 
<br/>drinking water and free education schemes.  Never been done before, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Global causes of poverty include lack of education  but in Fiji, we are looking at about 90 
<br/>percent rate of people who are educated.  Inequality  – we have addressed that issue.  Little or no 
<br/>access to livelihood, we have addressed that issue.  Lack of infrastructure, we have addressed that, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.  Inadequate access to clean water infrastructure, this Government has addressed all of 
<br/>those things, Mr. Speaker.  All of these areas are also relevant to Fiji and are being addressed through 
<br/>this Government, through various programmes, so it is a calculated way in which everything is done, 
<br/>subject to what we have Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wanted to underscore, Mr. Speaker, that there are initiatives and programmes to make the 
<br/>honourable  Members  realise  that  we  have  ways  to  assist  Fijians  to  gain  economically.    We  have 
<br/>enabled Fijians to be able to make a decent living and most importantly, the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>has its hands on the pulse of the nation.  We do not need any inquiry or study to tell us when our 
<br/>people need support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I do not support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the call made by the honourable Member to undertake an inquiry into the 
<br/>causes of poverty is grossly unwarranted.  There are many reports available which have dealt with 
<br/>the  subject  of  causes  and  extent  of  poverty  in  Fiji.    Information  and  statistical  data  is  already 
<br/>available.  How will another report on poverty help?  This inquiry will be a sheer waste of resources 
<br/>and time of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is there to find out?  We all know that decline in income due to job 
<br/>losses and reduced working hours is the underlying factor pushing people into hardship.  The Russia-
<br/></span><span>Ukraine war is not helping either.  Each and every country on the planet is hit by the external shock 
<br/></span><span>caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  war  in  Ukraine.    Just  like  these  countries,  Fiji  is 
<br/>delivering on social and economic  recovery strategies as  announced by the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and the Minister for Economy during the Revised Budget announced recently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The challenges posed by the pandemic over the past two years and the consequences of floods 
<br/>and  cyclones  in  Fiji  have  further  strengthened  the  Government’s  resolve  to  assist  Fijians  facing 
<br/>hardship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government has provided significant and critical relief to all Fijians to maintain 
<br/>financial stability.  This was achieved in a period that was most challenging for us and the rest of the 
<br/>world.    The  COVID-19  pandemic  essentially  resets  everything.    Yet,  due  to  the  prudent  socio-
<br/>economic policies of the FijiFirst Government, we are here.  We still have an economy, we have 
<br/>excellent foreign reserves and liquidity, our borders are now open, we have planes to fly and we are 
<br/>about to embark on an unprecedented recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  actually  needed  is  the  continued  implementation  of  the 
<br/>comprehensive social and economic policies initiated by the Government.  There is a need for the 
<br/></span><span>relevant stakeholders to assist in the implementation of the policies, to ensure that the Fijians benefit 
<br/></span><span>and recover from the external pressures pushing people into hardship.  We are acting on the ground 
<br/>and creating livelihoods, instead of some inquiry as proposed by the honourable Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  support  has  been  provided  by  the  Fijian  Government  in  the  local 
<br/>government  arena,  to  ensure  Fijians  are  able  to  bounce  back  from  the  pandemic.    The  Fijian 
<br/>Government has consistently supported all Fijians across the board.  The financial support has seen 
<br/>towns and city’s commercial activities progressing, given that individuals were able to access relief 
<br/>assistance.  The waiver of market stall fees, kiosk and bean cart fees, public service vehicle fees has 
<br/>allowed the councils to attract more businesses and boost the economic activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  both  NFP  and  SODELPA  Members  called  Government 
<br/>assistance to Fijians as ‘freebies’ and ‘handouts’ - assistance that will help household and businesses 
<br/>to ease their hardship and to put Fiji on the road to recovery is termed, ‘vote buying’.  Now, it is the 
<br/>same the leader of  NFP  who did  not  support VAT reduction on 21 items, did  not  support the $4 
<br/>minimum wage rate, did not support reduction in fuel tax, did not support increase in the number of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1073 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recipients for TELS, did not support increase in number of recipients for TELS, did not support one-
<br/>off $50 for the elderlies, did not support VAT removal on cooking gas and the list goes on is now 
<br/>asking for an inquiry on poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what a joke! This is the level of hypocrisy we see. 
<br/>The reason given for the inquiry is to assign resources, - does he not know that the Revised Budget 
<br/>assigned resources to assist people in hardship? This was done after a wide Budget consultation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  the  waiver  of  the  Public  Service  Vehicle  (PSV)  or  base  fees  allowed  the  PSV 
<br/>proprietors to earn a living without worrying about the consistent cost of fees and charges. This would 
<br/>mean savings by the PSV holders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the removal of business licenses have contributed towards Ease of Doing 
<br/>Businesses and has created more investment through the establishment of small businesses. Fijians 
<br/>are now able to start up small businesses with the stream-lined processes and removal of fees that 
<br/>were required to be paid to the councils and other agencies previously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  note  that  there  is  no  increase  in  the  fees  and  charges 
<br/>imposed  by  the  municipal  councils.  Many  councils  have  charged  the  same  fees  over  many  years 
<br/>despite the cost of living and cost of service delivery have increased. The fees have not increased to 
<br/></span><span>ensure  that  the  ratepayers  are  not  burdened  to  pay  increased  fees  and  charges  at  this  time.  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker,  Sir,  now,  we  have  got  another  proposal  from  honourable  Radrodro  that  the  municipal 
<br/>council should be going out and asking ratepayers to pay up their rates during these difficult time 
<br/>when the Government is trying to ease the hardship.  We are trying our level best to come up with a 
<br/>payment plan and some practical solution so that it is a  win-win situation for both, the municipal 
<br/>council and the ratepayers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  investment  in  education  helps  in  poverty  reduction.  The  Government 
<br/>continues to support Fijians with various forms of social wages. The Government has made 5,000 
<br/>TVET places available for upskilling and reskilling of our people. The Government already provides 
<br/>free education grant, free textbooks and transport assistance to all students including sanitary pads to 
<br/>girls from Year 7 to Year 13. This supplements the income of people who are below the poverty line.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all familiar with the Fijian Affairs and Multi-Ethnic Scholarships. 
<br/>During those days if a student from a poor household did not receive a scholarship, he or she had no 
<br/>option  for  tertiary  education.  The  banks  did  not give  loans  because  the  families  did  not  have  the 
<br/>ability to pay the loan. The only other option was the parents FNPF, if they had that option. Most 
<br/>farmers, self-employed and labourers or casual employees did not have any option to support their 
<br/></span><span>children’s tertiary education dream.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2014, this has become possible. The TSLS is the FijiFirst Government’s bold initiative 
<br/>to  provide  opportunity  to  every  eligible  youth  who  is  talented  and  ambitious  to  attain  tertiary 
<br/>education without depending on their family members to pay their fees and other related expenses. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS, is a game changer to tertiary education in Fiji.  Such radical transformation 
<br/>was needed to build nations human capital development, moving away from the gated and ethnic 
<br/>distribution of scholarship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  also  raised  his  concern  related  to  the 
<br/>distribution  of  scholarship  and  his  concern  was  why  scholarship  was  not  offered  to  Foundation 
<br/>students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Year 13 and Foundation differ in several ways. The Government offers 
<br/>Year 13 free whereas for Foundation students, they have to pay for it. So those who can afford this 
<br/>have been taking a Foundation study.  This is the reason why Foundation is not supported. Year 13 
<br/>also provides fair and equitable situation in selecting students for Toppers. Why should students take 
<br/>loan to study Foundation when they can do Year 13 free and get direct entry in Degree programmes?

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has established that students who scored less marks in Year 13, did 
<br/>not  meet  the  NTS  cut-off  for  the  National  Toppers  Scholarship,  enrolled  for  Foundation  Degree, 
<br/>obtained excellent GPA and were given Toppers. This created unfair and inequitable situation for 
<br/>those who did Year 13 in one attempt and obtained marks for NTS eligibility.  It was also found that 
<br/>students doing Foundation repeated courses until they got the desired GPA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the action on the ground has taken off. The Fijian Government has initiated 
<br/>all that is needed to position our economy including local economy back on track to pre-pandemic 
<br/>era of growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the call for such inquiry is not unusual by the Opposition and we have seen 
<br/>this  tactic  before.  The  end  result  of  such  an  inquiry  will  not  make  any  difference  because  the 
<br/>Government  is  already  implementing  social  and  economic  policies  to  alleviate  poverty  which  is 
<br/>working pretty well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Government  has  set  out  detailed  roadmap  to  recovery  in  the  last  few  budgets 
<br/>including the recent Revised Budget.  We cannot waste resources, time or money on inquiries that 
<br/>are designed to add no value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also heard from honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa  just a while ago, she 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>used a very old report, Save the Children’s Fund  Report of 1998.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And we live in a different time now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Her whole intervention was based on children dropping out of school.  Least does she know 
<br/>that the attrition rate now is 97 percent which simply means that we have more children in school 
<br/>than a dropout.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pace at which the Opposition works will make the people wait.  Fijians 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>want the assistance now and we are in action mode to assist Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as honourable Salote Radrodro made the statement that this Government is 
<br/>full of talk, no action.  It is the other way around, we are in action except they are talking and trying 
<br/>to say that nothing is happening on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the motion that is before the House and I thank you for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity to respond. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  continue  with  my 
<br/>intervention, let me just say that just now the honourable Minister for Education told a naked lie in 
<br/>this  Parliament  that  NFP  opposed  the  removal  of  VAT,  Minimum  Wage  and  the  extra  fuel  tax 
<br/>removal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- We supported the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, precisely 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for that reason. So I want to correct that for the record.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Too much naked lies from the Government side.

<div><span>1075 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to strongly support this motion 
<br/>that is  before us petitioning this august  House to approve that the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/>Affairs undertakes an inquiry into the causes of poverty and report back to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go into the substantive argument about why we have raised this 
<br/>motion before the House.  I want to take this time and it is quite fitting really on this occasion when 
<br/>our Parliament is debating the issue of finding ways to alleviate poverty in Fiji, that I would like to 
<br/>pay tribute to a very dear friend of mine and a friend of my family who passed away about three 
<br/>weeks ago.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, you know this gentleman that I am referring to, I am not sure if you 
<br/>will still remember by now but I will remind you later on about who he is.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this gentleman was Father Josefa Tuimavule, a priest, who was 50 years 
<br/>when he died and he was 20 years a Catholic priest.  He was the member of the congregation of the 
<br/>Mission or commonly referred to as the Vincentian Fathers or the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.  
<br/>As I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he told me a story when your honourable Speaker was Your 
<br/>Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji  and  you  came to attend a wedding at the Pacific 
<br/>Regional Seminary, where one of your grandnieces was wedded and he was the priest officiating.  
<br/>He was, perhaps keen to welcome you and he addressed, Your Excellency Ratu Epeli Mara and on 
<br/></span><span>the second time he made another mistake by saying Ratu Epeli Ganilau.  I believe you would have 
<br/></span><span>remembered  that  occasion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  sometime  back  when  you  were  the  President  of  the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Two wrongs do not make a right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I attended his funeral on Friday, 25</span><span>th</span><span> March in Natovi 
<br/>where close to 3,000 people attended, mostly the poor, a place where he had extended his services in 
<br/>his ministry as a priest.  There are so many places where he had reached out to and this was reflected 
<br/>by the turnout of the people from all over Fiji who had come to send him off.  I wanted to pay tribute 
<br/>to Father Jo, as we commonly know him, because as we debate this matter, these are the people who 
<br/>actually make a difference on the ground and who reach out to the communities in the different areas 
<br/>where they serve.  I just wish Father Jo a safe journey on his journey back and hopefully we will see 
<br/>him later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say, it does not take a rocket science to know that greater poverty 
<br/>equals greater social decay, greater crime, greater lawlessness and many other cascading challenges.  
<br/>Nowhere is that more evident than right here in Fiji.  It is why the Bureau of Statistics - Household 
<br/></span><span>and Income Expenditure Report for 2019-2020 headlined their poverty statistics on two fronts - the 
<br/></span><span>basic needs poverty line which is defined as the line below where individuals cannot meet their food 
<br/>and non-food minimum needs and the second is, food poverty line which is defined as the line where 
<br/>individuals cannot meet their basic food needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we recall, the results were shocking, Mr. Speaker.  The survey told us that around 258,000 
<br/>of our people were poverty stricken.  At the time of this survey, the estimated population of Fiji was 
<br/>864,132.  The survey said 258,053 of our people out of 800,000 in this nation are in absolute poverty.  
<br/>That is almost a quarter of the population, and I wonder if the Government actually knows this.  I 
<br/>wonder, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Government is self-aware enough to know that every time they stand 
<br/>up in this Parliament to dazzle the nation with empty words, 258,000 of our people are listening with 
<br/>disgust, while their stomachs grumbled.  You only need to read Allen Lockington’s daily updates on 
<br/></span><span>Facebook</span><span> of him and his noble team doing such awesome work in a simple taxi, about getting out 
<br/>and about, reaching out and helping others in the Lautoka area.

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I at this juncture offer a shout out and a huge </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to Allen, 
<br/>his  team,  including  his  taxi  driver  and  especially  his  good  Samaritan  donors  who  do  not  seek 
<br/>publicity.  Sir, Allan and his intrepid team’s daily visits are a lifeline to some of our 258,000 people, 
<br/>stuck in this vicious of absolute poverty.  I wonder if the Government has the decency to be ashamed 
<br/>when they bamboozle with Qorvis and Vatis speeches here, while 258,000 of our people in absolute 
<br/>poverty  wail  in  despair  and  sorrow  because  they  cannot  take  a  loved  ones  for  urgent  and  proper 
<br/>medical treatment, much less by medication. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Does the honourable Minister for Health possess any semblance of doing no harm, when there 
<br/>is  no  balanced  and  regular  nutrition  for  258,000  of  our  people  in  absolute  poverty?    Is  he  even 
<br/>remotely concerned that the empty calories of CJ Patel’s Maggi Noodles are the only products filling 
<br/>many stomachs these days? Is he pre-empting the massive spikes to his hospitals and health centres 
<br/>to cater for NCD-related illnesses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  does  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  stop  for  a  moment  to  analyse 
<br/>students in all her schools and make the link between children who cannot bring or buy a school 
<br/>lunch or school books, weighed up against school attrition numbers with school exam pass rates? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How about the years of teaching experience and genuine care for students, drained annually 
<br/></span><span>because  the  honourable  Minister  is  only  too  quick  to  farewell  teachers  at  55  with  a  selfie  and  a 
<br/>handshake?    Will  these  forced  retirements  add  to  our  already  ballooning  poverty  statistics,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wonder if the honourable Minister for Economy is aware that his recent Budget ideas give 
<br/>almost no relief, and that taxpayers cannot see any difference or cushioning at the supermarket cash 
<br/>register, throwing many more people into poverty? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wonder if the honourable Minister realises that blaming Russia and global shifts in supply 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and demand as an excuse for more price increases, does not help them in the lead up to elections? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is the honourable Minister aware that when he arrogantly demands Opposition Party policies, 
<br/>taxpayers have lived through 15 years of theirs and know a losing streak when they have to prevail 
<br/>through their Government’s failed policies and comedy of errors? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, I wonder if the honourable Minister for Agriculture knows how silly he looks when he 
<br/>takes a big team to give out teaspoons of seeds in small packets to some of our 258,000 people living 
<br/></span><span>in informal settlements, with a condescending directive to go and do backyard farming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is the honourable Minister for Defence capable enough to make the logical link between our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>258,000 people in the rut of absolute poverty? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Does the honourable Minister for Defence possess the capacity to translate the alarming rates 
<br/>of  robbery,  shoplifting,  breaking  and  entering,  drug  sales,  drugs  turf  wars,  drug  addiction, 
<br/>prostitution,  domestic  violence,  rape,  sexual  violence,  assault,  murder,  et  cetera,  with  the 
<br/>humanitarian  lens of 258,000 of our people living in absolute poverty or is the honourable Minister 
<br/>just content to let the Police Commissioner’s favoured Vunimaqo Team to run wild and outside the 
<br/>lines national  law enforcement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you know I tried to raise this in this august Parliament the sickening scourge 
<br/>of the evil spread of drugs in Fiji before, with a motion for an inquiry.  I did this, Mr. Speaker, in 
<br/>2019.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1077 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As this House knows, I got assaulted by the honourable Prime Minister and I was unjustly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suspended for six months for those very effort.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, may I, in line with this motion, please, advocate that at the very least, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Defence tried to get a drug rehabilitation programme with a proper facility 
<br/>and trained counsellors going immediately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drug addicts need help not condemnation, Mr. Speaker, and St. Giles is not helping either.  
<br/>We know the issues, and the Government certainly knows the issues intimately as well.  But turning 
<br/>back to this motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously my sympathies are with the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Social Welfare.  She knows these numbers, she knows the need out there.  She probably also knows 
<br/>that she is way down the food chain in terms of Government funding allocation priorities, as we see 
<br/>in every budget, every year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Minister for Economy who is obviously 
<br/>going to bore us all to tears as he loves to do so, with highfalutin, truth-lacking scenarios and incidents 
<br/>that none of us can validate.  Please, honourable Minister, save yourself from your usual exuberant 
<br/>verbosity, because the taxpayers pick it apart, to heap ridicule and scorn on you, as the </span><span>de facto</span><span> leader 
<br/></span><span>of FijiFirst Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people are no fools,  waste time 
<br/>on FBC’s </span><span>Aaina</span><span>, or the programme of </span><span>Nai Lalakai</span><span>, </span><span>Walesi</span><span>, </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>et cetera, or give fake likes to 
<br/>their </span><span>Facebook</span><span> pages.  They know who the real snake and mongoose are… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…and you will both get trapped by their nets at the upcoming Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, on that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally ask everyone, especially the Government, and I 
<br/>urge all honourable Members of this Parliament to, please, support this motion for the betterment of 
<br/>our nation and our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to talk on this motion 
<br/></span><span>and like everyone on this side of the House, I think it has been adequately proven today that there is 
<br/>no need for this motion.  It is a ludicrous motion, the kinds of statistics, the things that have been 
<br/>expressed by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, the statistics 
<br/>that have been given by the Ministry of Defence, anyone in their right mind will know that there is 
<br/>no need for this motion.  Absolutely no need! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the motion is saying, as a number of people have said on this side, that there is a need 
<br/>for us to re-examine the causes of poverty, that we need to get a group of people to sit down and talk 
<br/>about the causes of poverty.  We all know what the causes of poverty are, the reports have been there, 
<br/>they have been expressed.  Why is there a need to do this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The causes of poverty in anywhere around the world is always based on a number of things, 
<br/>inequality in income distribution – that is something that the Government has been addressing over 
<br/>these past few  years;  access to productive resources  – people that have productive resources can 
<br/>make use of that to get out of poverty; and those that do not have access to the productive resources, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they will have a harder problem trying to get out of the cycle of poverty and also  access to Social 
<br/>Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  look  back  at  what  Government  has  been  doing  since  it  established  its  National 
<br/>Development Plan, that is precisely what the National Development Plan focusses on.  It targets the 
<br/>kinds of things that we need to eradicate poverty, and that National Development Plan sets out that 
<br/>in order address this, we have to have a multi-sectoral approach.  So, if you are going to look at what 
<br/>the  Government  is  doing  to  address  poverty,  it  is  being  done  in  all  the  different  agencies  and 
<br/>Ministries.  I think the honourable Minister for Defence pointed this out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look a bit further in, what I am saying is that everything that I am talking about now, 
<br/>the causes of poverty, we all know it.  If you look back at the policies and the plans that we have in 
<br/>Government, they address precisely those things - jobs, the focus now on bringing in foreign direct 
<br/>investors in so we can have more jobs and you have seen that this has been growing over the past 
<br/>years. We have had a few blips along the way because of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, COVID-19 and, again, because 
<br/>of the things that are happening now around the world in terms of the cost of transportation, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On education, that has been expressed here and the kind of things that were expressed by the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister for Social Welfare, a lot of us remember those times when it was difficult for 
<br/></span><span>us, the cost of education was so high.  I am a person that when I went to school, my </span><span>sulu vakataga</span><span>
<br/>and my shirt were sewn by my mother.   We could not afford it because we had to pay for school fees 
<br/>and so forth.  But nowadays, those things are paid for by Government.  It is a huge change.  That is 
<br/>showing the commitment that this Government has to address those things that affect poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly on education, one of the things that we always have to remember that in Fiji, one 
<br/>of the things that impacts us so much now is climate - climate change.  We all know what happened 
<br/>in </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  The impact that it had on our economy, and this is something that happens all the 
<br/>time.  This year, we have had no cyclone but we have had two floods.  The cost of the floods to the 
<br/>roads themselves is going to cost us $100 million, $100 million just to do that.  So, those things are 
<br/>impacting on us all the time.  The need for social justice, the lack of food and water, all of these 
<br/>things are being addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The infrastructure, as I have pointed out a few times, there has been a lot of investment into 
<br/>infrastructure by Government.  In the energy sector, Government has implemented a lot of measures 
<br/>to alleviate poverty.  In doing so, in 2016, Government through the review of the Rural Electrification 
<br/>policy, removed the 10 percent community contribution.  Before, when they wanted power, they had 
<br/></span><span>to </span><span>soli</span><span> and get their 10 percent.  This Government decided, “No, you have the right to get it, we will 
<br/></span><span>pay for it.”  That made a huge difference across this country.  Communities no longer had to make 
<br/>that payment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  latest  development  by  Government  now  for  our  2022  electrification  policy,  it  now 
<br/>expands that service to cover informal settlements, squatter, peri-urban and urban areas.  This is an 
<br/>addition to the rural and maritime areas which are formally in the scope of our Rural Electrification 
<br/>Project Team.  So, everyone is able to acquire the service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It means also that not everyone is going to get it at the same time because now, there are a lot 
<br/>more applications and it will also depend on the budget that we have where you can make available 
<br/>to do the electrification over time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our electrification projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2016 to-date, Government has invested 
<br/>approximately $159 million for the rural electrification.  That has led to 10,901 households being 
<br/>connected to the EFL grid and another 7,794 households receiving electricity in the form of solar 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1079 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>home systems, benefitting a total of 93,475 individuals.  That is not empty talk.  That is decisive 
<br/>action, realising that access to infrastructure has an impact on poverty and making sure that we supply 
<br/>that to the people that need it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over and above that, the Government together with the support of some funding agencies, 
<br/>have invested close to $6 million on solar hybrid systems.  That means it has solar panels and has a 
<br/>generator.  When there is not enough sun, the generator charges up the batteries and from that they 
<br/>are able to provide electricity.  We have communities that have been assisted and those include the; 
<br/>Solevu  High  School,  Tukavesi  Village,  Namara  Village  in  Kadavu,  Nakoro  Village  in  Navosa, 
<br/>Yasawa High School and Vio Island.  That investment has been taking place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also at the same time, for energy, there is a focus on making sure that those who are getting 
<br/>less income, we give them some additional assistance, so we have the EFL subsidy in order to create 
<br/>affordability  for  low  income  households  to  access  electricity  from  the  EFL  grid.    For  residential 
<br/>customers  whose  household  income  is  less  than  or  equal  to  $30,000  per  year,  Government  is 
<br/>subsidising 16.34 cents for the first 100 units used.  Moreover, for primary and secondly schools, 
<br/>whose usage is  less than or equal  to  200 kilowatt  hours per month, Government  is  subsidising at 
<br/>12.85 cents per unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on the 2020 EFL Report, more than 41,000 households and 795 schools are benefitting 
<br/>from this subsidy.  Why is this emphasis?  It is because we know access to power, access to electricity 
<br/>is important to help people to get out of poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of water, there has been a lot of comments about water.  I agree that we are facing 
<br/>the issue of water in the Suva area.  These issues are being addressed, one of the major problems is 
<br/>that the systems that we currently have, its capacity is less than the demand that we have.  That being, 
<br/>the solution is already in play, as we all know, the Viria Project, the Rewa River Water Scheme, that 
<br/>eventually will come online.  Once we have that, we have some other adjustments, we get rid of some 
<br/>of the old infrastructure, we reduce the non-revenue water with some of the additional things that 
<br/>have been targeted in the Revised Budget that the honourable Minister for Economy had talked about, 
<br/>we should begin to alleviate some of those problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water  Authority  of  Fiji,  Sir,  the  vision  of  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  is  Clean  Water  and 
<br/>Sanitation for Better Life.  The two initiatives that are directly related to poverty alleviation are the 
<br/>Free Water Allowance and the Rainwater Harvesting and Free Tanks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Free  Water  Allowance  started  in  2012  and  assisted  customers  who  have  a  combined 
<br/></span><span>income of less than $30,000 annually.  Under that assistance, around 92,500 litres of water is free per 
<br/>year.  This is around 23,000 litres per household per quota.  The number of households approved was 
<br/>34,385 under this assistance which is an equivalent population of $170,000.  This amounts to a total 
<br/>value of $467,958 per year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  in  addition  to  this  is  the  Rainwater  Harvesting  Scheme  for  those  customers  in  non-
<br/>metered areas.  Since the inception of the Scheme, WAF has distributed around 12,072 water tanks.  
<br/>Another 1,800 tanks are expected to be delivered this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same ground, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addressing water in the Ministry of Lands, we also 
<br/>do ground water development where money is set aside to provide safe, clean drinking water to rural 
<br/>communities, both in large islands and small islands.  The total beneficiaries so far from the borehole 
<br/>drinking and the reticulation of water from boreholes has been provided to around 6,000 Fijians since 
<br/>2015 when reticulation was conducted by the Ministry.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the important things that should also be done over the past few years 
<br/>is to make sure that we can spread the roading infrastructure that we have in this country.  The Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority has the aim to effectively, efficiently and sustainably provide friendly land transport 
<br/>network.  The Bainimarama-led Government has constructed rural roads to areas that have never had 
<br/>access to reliable road network before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Minister for Health talked about the Nakida Road.  He 
<br/>and I walked up that river, I think we crossed it maybe 23 times to get to the village.  Today, they 
<br/>have a road on which they can bring their produce down and sell it in the markets where it can be 
<br/>sold.  They mentioned major rural roads that were opened up in our rural communities to social and 
<br/>economic opportunities such as the Nakorosule to Nawaisomo Village in the highlands of Naitasiri, 
<br/>Baulevu to Delaidamanu Village in Naitasiri, the tarsealing has been mentioned already today of the 
<br/>Valley Road in Sigatoka, the tarsealing of Serea to Sawani Road, the Kiuva to Kaba Peninsula Road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently  we  have  opened  up  rural  road  to  the village  of  Matokana  and  Navitilevu  in  the 
<br/>highlands of Navosa.  People who used to walk or follow the rivers or travel on horseback before can 
<br/></span><span>use those roads today.  Currently in the highlands of Namosi, road construction including the road 
<br/></span><span>from Wainiyavu to Wainilotulevu.  Also the Government is working on the replacement and renewal 
<br/>of crossings and bridges in rural areas.  All these rural roads and crossings are aimed at providing 
<br/>access  and  also  alleviate  poverty  for  rural  dwellers.    Also  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  other 
<br/>programmes that are being done.  This is just an example of some from the Ministry of Infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, the mineral resources we have in our country 
<br/>actually belongs to the State.  It was under this Government and under this honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>that we said, the royalty that we get for the things that are extracted from under the ground, 80 percent 
<br/>of that goes to the people that are landowners.  Never ever, not from the 1970 Alliance, SVT or who 
<br/>you call it, never happened before.  Under this Government, we make sure that this money can be 
<br/>given to them so that they can do something about it and improve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Your predecessors did not give 1.0 percent, we are giving 80 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Also, there is a lot of emphasis to the Ministry of Lands on the Land 
<br/>Use Reform Programme, land that was not being used, they can put into the Land Bank and out of 
<br/>these, they are able generate revenue that can help the landowners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  development  of</span><span>  iTaukei</span><span>  land  -  $50,000,  development  of  State 
<br/>land, the survey of mahogany plantations. All of these things focussed on helping people get them 
<br/>out of poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Salote Radrodro had a dig at the Government for not trying 
<br/>to address poverty but I remember quite well that when we had the debate on the Revised Budget, 
<br/>she said, “I vote against this Budget.”  In that Budget, we said the VAT on the following goods will

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who is pro-poor and who is anti-poor? When we come up with suggestions of things that we 
<br/>need to do to address the poor, they do not support it just for the sake of not supporting it.  How can 
<br/>someone have the audacity to stand up in this House and accuse the Government of not being pro-
<br/>poor when they do not support the kind of suggestions that we made in the Revised Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- How can you have the audacity to do something like that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Salote Radrodro also suggested that we should be like 
<br/>Norway. Do you know how much personal income tax they pay in Norway? It is on that basis that 
<br/></span><span>they are able to provide all those services. So as we look at things that are happening around the 
<br/></span><span>world, do not just say, “We should be like Norway.” Think of the underlying things that happen in 
<br/>that country that allow them to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Salote Radrodro says the new CEO of Water Authority of Fiji 
<br/>will not be able to deliver. How do you know? Can you look into the future?  Can you see what is 
<br/>going to happen? The new CEO of Water Authority of Fiji has gone through a very rigorous selection 
<br/>process. They have looked at what we need to be able to run Water Authority of Fiji with all the 
<br/>challenges that it has and that person has been selected. And I want the Water Authority of Fiji’s 
<br/>CEO, staff and their board to know that we in Government fully support them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second last thing that I want to say is, I think the speech by the Minister 
<br/>for Defence where he was telling us that 51 percent of the Revised Budget is focussed on helping to 
<br/>alleviate poverty - 6 percent of GDP. If there is one thing we know, the people on this side of the 
<br/>House, they do not just talk, this side of the House is about being well-organised, decisive and action-
<br/>orientated and that is what the Government does. This Government has been fighting against poverty 
<br/>alleviation and will continue to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my 
<br/></span><span>support  for  the  motion  before  the  House.  Sir,  258,000  live  under  the  basic  needs  poverty  line 
<br/>according to the 2019-2020 Household  Income and Expenditure Survey; 192,977  </span><span>iTaukei, </span><span>58,933 
<br/>Fijians and 6,143 from other population making up an absolute poverty. That is facts. For decades, 
<br/>Fiji had been undergoing a period of significant social and economic uncertainty.  Commentators 
<br/>regularly predicted the eminent collapse of an over specialised economy, too heavily dependent on 
<br/>sugar and tourism and a top heavy bureaucracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  contribution  will  focus  on  our  urban  poverty  and  those  who  live  in 
<br/>informal  settlements.  Definitions  of  poverty  remaining  problematic  and  it  is  obvious  from  the 
<br/>findings in Fiji that people have such complex methods for survival and income generation that the 
<br/>alienation  of  poverty  line  based  on  cash  income  only  is  inadequate.    Despite  the  problems  of 
<br/>measurement, there is  no doubt  that there is increasing  poverty in  Fiji  in the sense that  growing 
<br/>numbers do not have access to adequate food or housing and that greater numbers of children are 
<br/>unable to attend school.

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even where income figures are used as measure of poverty, the fact that a 
<br/>lot of our people are still living below the poverty line or are vulnerable to poverty while a greater 
<br/>number of our households have someone employed in informal employment indicates that incomes 
<br/>in  formal sector particularly for unskilled  workers are not  adequate to  enable households to  meet 
<br/>basic needs. Surveys have shown, Sir, that life is becoming harder for urban fringed dwellers and in 
<br/>a new squatter settlement, but for squatters in old established settlements, the people have gradually 
<br/>become more involved in formal employment and are in a better position to eventually take advantage 
<br/>of schemes such as Government low cost housing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the major problems  of hardship and poverty appear to be in  areas where 
<br/>households are becoming increasingly overcrowded such as in urban villages and on the outskirts of 
<br/>Suva. Although these people show evidence of being heavily dependent upon informal activities such 
<br/>as gardening, fishing and selling of food, it has to be recognised that income from this is erratic and 
<br/>cannot be assumed to be regular enough to enable people to pay for formal rented housing or even 
<br/>increasingly to pay school fees or books or uniforms, let alone have access to a basic nutritious diet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, solutions to the increasing poverty of Fiji’s people are not to be found easily.  
<br/>Poverty  alleviation  can  be  carried  out  in  several  ways.    Welfare  handouts  are  often  necessarily, 
<br/></span><span>particularly  in  an  emergency  situation  where  people  are  destitute  or  affected  by  a  major  natural 
<br/></span><span>disaster such as a hurricane or drought. However, the Fiji Government like most Pacific Islands in 
<br/>the 1990s is concerned that welfare payments most often caused dependency. If used over a long 
<br/>period of time, the provision of basic social services along with income generating and community 
<br/>development  projects  are  generally  accepted  as  being  the  most  sensible  approach  with  additional 
<br/>safety nets and income transfers for those who are particularly vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, political trades-off made while enhancing overall economic growth such as 
<br/>that happening through global economic restructuring, frequently mean that the non-poor also benefit 
<br/>from schemes designed to lift the poor from their marginalised situation.  Low cost housing schemes 
<br/>and job creation projects are common examples.  At the same time, as enhancing economic growth 
<br/>for the entire nation, Government and Government agencies have to be aware of the impact.  For 
<br/>example,  economic  restructuring  schemes  on  the  poor  in  the  short-term  before  they  are  able  to 
<br/>participate in the overall benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr; Speaker, Sir, the conventional wisdom now is that broader socio-economic policies such 
<br/>as  reducing  unnecessary  and  strenuous  work,  for  example,  carting  water  from  a  long  distance, 
<br/>employment  creation  schemes,  reducing  unwanted  pregnancies,  parasitic  diseases  and  providing 
<br/></span><span>universal, free education both formal and non-formal as well as access to medical care will go much 
<br/></span><span>further in reducing poverty in the long term than merely patching up as problems arise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we talk about poverty, Sir, the difficulties our people are facing on the ground and the 
<br/>solutions  to  these  situations,  allow  me  to  talk  about  Ba  Provincial  Holding,  since  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has spoken about our company.  In his response to an Oral Question raised in this 
<br/>august House yesterday, the honourable Attorney-General said, and I quote from Page 996 of the 
<br/></span><span>Uncorrected Daily Hansard</span><span>: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There is an abuse of funds in the Ba Provincial Holdings.  There is fraction, there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is friction and there are fractures in the company itself.  Funds have gone missing.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  unfair  on  the  part  of  the  honourable  Attorney-General  or  for  any 
<br/>Member  of  Parliament  to  come  and  attack  any  person  or  persons  or  organisations  in  this  august 
<br/>House, who are unable to defend themselves.  To make things worse, making accusations that has 
<br/>been recorded in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> without a single shred of evidence, is a very serious issue.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Evidence is there, I have documents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Should  you  have  any  personal  differences  with  Management  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Directors of the Company then, please, you sort this out with them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  Ba  Provincial  Holdings  Company  Limited  was  incorporated  as  a  private  company  in 
<br/>February 1995, following the resolution of the Ba Provincial Council to establish an entity to manage 
<br/>the Council’s assets commercially with an objective to be a profitable and self-sustaining investment 
<br/>company in providing satisfactory returns to its shareholders.  Up to 1994, most of the Council’s 
<br/>assets and investments were administered by the Ba Provincial Council Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In pursuant to the resolution of  the Ba Provincial Council, the $1.9 million ordinary shares 
<br/>held in Trust by the Ba Provincial Council was transferred to the 593 registered landowning units 
<br/>and the three-endorsed entities, whose on behalf, the shares were held.  Each of these landowning 
<br/>units’ Trusts are registered pursuant to the iTaukei Land Trust Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just described the history of the Ba Provincial Holdings Company 
<br/>since its inception 27 years ago.  The company has gone through thick and thin, and is still standing 
<br/></span><span>tall.  It is owned by the 593 landowning units of Ba Province, and operates Koronubu House, Tavaqia 
<br/></span><span>House, Vidilo House, the Lautoka Magistrates Court, Matanakilagi House, Ratu Nauliano House and 
<br/>the Rogorogoivuda House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Attorney-General  has  correctly  pointed  out  in  his  Right  of  Reply  this 
<br/>morning, that the West is the backbone of our economy.  It is my advice to the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General to support Ba Provincial Holdings, as it is the only provincial company owned by the 593 
<br/>landowning units.  That is the model for Fiji.  Please, support the Ba Provincial Holdings Company 
<br/>Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that, I support the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  support  this  motion  because  for  a 
<br/>country, we are told, has so much, too many of our children are going to bed without having had a 
<br/>decent dinner; too many young people are not able to find decent work; too many families do not live 
<br/>in decent homes, and this is the reality in Fiji today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have had calls upon calls, messages upon messages, from mums and dads, needing help for 
<br/></span><span>their children’s books, groceries or money to supplement their income and from tenants who cannot 
<br/></span><span>pay their rents.  There is only so much that I can do, Mr. Speaker, but there is so much more that we 
<br/>can all do together.  And  I really want  to  thank the honourable Professor Prasad for, once again, 
<br/>raising the incidents of poverty in this Parliament,  because if we have had so much economic growth, 
<br/>the increase in GDP and all these developments, what does it mean for that mum that cannot afford 
<br/>to feed her children? What does it mean for elderly people looking after their grandkids?  What does 
<br/>it mean or where is it when crime increases because of higher youth unemployment?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to some points in a discussion paper titled, 
<br/>‘Poverty in Older Persons in Fiji’.  This was submitted by the author, Mr. Mohammed Hassan Khan, 
<br/>to the National Council on Older Persons (NCOP) on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> January this year.  With his permission, I 
<br/>outline some contents of his paper, Mr. Speaker: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Poverty  is  more  than  just  a  lack  of  income.    It  can  be  caused  or  be  a  result  of  a  lack  of 
<br/>adequate  food,  water,  sanitation,  shelter,  education  or  healthcare.    It  can  also  involve  effective 
<br/>expulsion from opportunities and the support of family, work and community.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite these preventable factors in terms of old age poverty, what needs to be considered is 
<br/>the total effect of a very wide range of risk factors for poverty that are more likely to affect seniors 
<br/>and by that, I mean, people aged 60 plus, than others: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Couples and individuals are seriously challenged in meeting large unexpected costs of 
<br/>medical or emergencies of health and family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased frailty and higher health risks of health conditions create higher financial 
<br/>needs for medical treatments and medicines.  Such pharmaceuticals may not be in the 
<br/>Free Medicine List of the current scheme and the pandemic, as we all know, has further 
<br/>increased the vulnerabilities of life and living for older persons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major issue faced by growing number of seniors is the decreased capacity for self-care 
<br/>and for those living on their own, the cost of maintenance and repairs and upkeep of their 
<br/>home which create significant pressure on their limited pension and other income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major contributor to poverty for older people is becoming single or becoming a single 
<br/>income unit, following the death of a spouse, and this is particularly an issue for women 
<br/></span><span>who tend to outlive their husbands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lack of mobility due to old age disability, amputations because of diabetes and other 
<br/>debilitating  diseases,  requiring  full  or  part-time  carer  is  costly.    This  is  further 
<br/>compounded by the fact that family support is diminishing very rapidly due to external 
<br/>migration and for rural seniors, the departure of children, family members and younger 
<br/>relatives for urban centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social isolation is increasing, becoming a major area of concern for practically the same 
<br/>reasons, as I have just mentioned. With this, the major factor is the lack of family support, 
<br/>as we now have old people looking after the very old or the old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a large number of seniors who are still required to work and often at menial jobs 
<br/>after retirement and retrenchment, simply because their pensions are inadequate or they 
<br/>have not been on any pension or they have to support their families or relatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many anecdotal and media stories of elders in our various communities, like market 
<br/>vendors, aging and aged farmers, who continue to work to survive.  This is one of the best examples 
<br/></span><span>of the plight of many other senior citizens, who are required to stay working for themselves and for 
<br/></span><span>their families because of poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With poverty remaining the biggest challenge facing the majority of elderly people across 
<br/>Fiji, most have no option but to work into old age for a living in various parts of Fiji.  For many 
<br/>people, Mr. Speaker, the decision to work is their own and it is the desire of the older people to keep 
<br/>working to contribute to family income and to remain active and productive.  Others say they work 
<br/>because they have no choice, because they have to support sick children or grandchildren in their 
<br/>care or because it is the only way to make ends meet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One in five older people in Fiji aged 60 and above work and almost all of them do it because 
<br/>they have to.  Many of our seniors are working past their retirement age, wanting to remain active, 
<br/>refusing to depend on others, paying off loans and not having anyone to rely on. There are also many 
<br/>seniors who continue to work.

<div><span>1085 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very few work to keep themselves occupied, but to be able to afford their daily expenses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because of the rising cost of living and the fact that they pay indirect taxes like that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need this Committee to sit down and examine the root causes of 
<br/>poverty.    The  Committee  needs  to  consult  with  NGOs,  religious  organisations  and  community 
<br/>leaders, to help create sensible and lasting solutions that deal with poverty and, of course, data is 
<br/>important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are Government policies benefitting all Fijians?  Are some communities more susceptible to 
<br/>causes of poverty than others?  This is why desegregated data is important and the Committee, if 
<br/>approved, would look into that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I know that the honourable Attorney-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, thinks that desegregated 
<br/>data  is  racist,  and  that  is  just  a  shame.    So,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  Mr.  Dinesh  Kumar, 
<br/>originally  from  Ellington  in  Rakiraki,  now  of  Narere,  and  his  team  of  charity  workers  and  their 
<br/>sponsors for everything that they have done and continue to do to help and support those that they 
<br/>know are living in poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I appeal to all honourable Members on the other side to, please, examine your conscience, 
<br/></span><span>look deep into your hearts and realize that this issue can no longer be ignored.   You know it, I know 
<br/>it, and the people of Fiji know it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  </span><span>Vinaka Vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- My apologies, Mr. Speaker, I did not hear my name mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the list but since you have given me the opportunity, I would like to contribute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for giving me the opportunity, I thought I would raise few issues regarding the 
<br/>motion before us.  Firstly, on the Household Income Expenditure (HIES) Report, there were some 
<br/>figures  mentioned  by  the  Government  side  on  the  poverty  rate  in  2013/2014  -  28  percent  and  in 
<br/>2019/2020 – 29.9 percent.  They were saying it is going down but that is an increase, and that is 
<br/>something I would like to clarify. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue which was raised by the Government side was regarding poverty rates and 
<br/>yesterday, honourable Seruiratu, mentioned the development in the rural areas but if you look at the 
<br/>Report, there is section there which specifically states the poverty rate in terms of the rural areas.  
<br/>Just to quote from there, “Poverty rate is consistent with the distribution for the poor where majority 
<br/>of them were living in rural areas in 2019/2020.  It shows a high rural poverty rate of 42 percent 
<br/></span><span>which contained around 62 percent of the total poor population, so that is just responding on some 
<br/></span><span>of the data which was shared with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  a  past  sitting  of  Parliament  where  we  discussed  the  HIES  2019/2020  Report,  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General went at great lengths to question the methodology regarding this HIES 
<br/>2019/2020 Report.  So, I would like to share some of the responses of the removed CEO of Bureau 
<br/>of Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  few  responses  there  which  clarify  what  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned.  Let me quote from that Report,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Fiji  Bureau  of  Statistics  (FBS)  was  still  able  to 
<br/>conduct the survey, process, analyze and publish the 2019-20 HIES Report despite the 
<br/>40% reduction in their budgetary allocation.  As a result, most Established Staff who are 
<br/>Supervisors had to forego their overtime meal entitlements and subsistence allowances, 
<br/>despite  them  having  to  attend  evening  and  weekend  interviews  with  the  Enumerators 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>depending on the time preferences of the survey participants.  I commend the staff for 
<br/>their full commitment…”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, going on the methodology and sampling, this is what it states, it is important to note that 
<br/>the sampling methodology used in the 2019/2020 HIES is well-recognised internationally and also 
<br/>applied by other Pacific Island national statistics offices as endorsed by the Pacific Statistics Methods 
<br/>Board of which I am a member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For comparable purposes, in addition the 2017 Census was also used as a frame to randomly 
<br/>select the 600 enumeration areas.  All sample surveys will use the enumeration areas from the latest 
<br/>census data where all population were counted and in this case the 2017 Population and Housing 
<br/>Census.    The  purpose  of  the  sample  is  to  draw  inferences  on  the  population,  that  is,  the  data  is 
<br/>generated from a random sample size from the population of interest.  It also mentioned, to quantify 
<br/>and validate the effectiveness of any survey result is the role of any statistical agency to engage itself 
<br/>with any credible organisation that has the expertise to verify its survey results.  In this 2019/2020 
<br/>HIES we opted for the World Bank and Bristol University of UK for these reasons.  So, that is just 
<br/>responding to the criticism of the report by the honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go back to the Report itself, quoting from page 17 and this is an issue which was 
<br/></span><span>raised  but  again  it  was  seen  or  contended  by  Government  that  it  is  maybe  not  relevant  and  in 
<br/>according  to  the  words  of  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  it  is  not  in  accordance  with  their 
<br/>philosophy.  The issue about ethnicity, ethnic data or desegregation of statistics according to ethnicity 
<br/>or other components, so the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> population group dominates the poverty rates and distribution of 
<br/>the poor with 36 percent and 75 percent respectively.  That is something which is highlighted there 
<br/>and in that table, </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>make up 74.8 percent distribution of the poor, Indo-Fijian is 22.8 percent 
<br/>and Others is 2.4 percent.  If you look at some of the professionals who deal with research, population 
<br/>studies and the issue of desegregated data into various components including ethnicity, let me quote 
<br/>from Professor Steven Ratuva. He said and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Ethnicity  was  widely  used  as  a  variable  for  household  and  income  expenditure 
<br/>surveys because there was a general recognition that some ethnic groups were historically 
<br/>more disadvantaged than others.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was in the wake of the comments by the honourable Attorney-General that ethnicity and 
<br/>religious data would not contribute to Fiji’s progress as a nation.  Professor Ratuva said that having 
<br/>access to the information was important because it highlighted socio-economic differences between 
<br/></span><span>ethnic groups.  It was an important factor in nation-building through formulation of well-targeted 
<br/></span><span>policies that would address inequality between socio-economic groups and ethnic communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  many  developing  countries,  economic  development,  inequality,  politics  and  ethnicity 
<br/>intersect in often complex and sometimes violent ways.  Most modern states including New Zealand 
<br/>segregate data along ethnic lines because of the need to be more proactive towards creating a more 
<br/>diverse, equal and tolerant society. Dr. Neelesh Gounder from the University of the South Pacific …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Oh, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I knew you were going to say that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is an economics lecturer, he has done research in the field and, of course, he has done 
<br/>more than anyone on that side of the House.  He said that those  not happy with the ethnic-based 
<br/>policy needed to target the policy and not the data and HIES was just a messenger and shooting the 
<br/>messenger would not  help.   Recording data on ethnicity  and there are several  policy  areas where 
<br/>ethnic data is relevant and required.  Ethnic data allows us to see beyond presumably prejudices that 
<br/>underlie ethnic groups and it seems that Government wants to avoid race- based policies that may 
<br/>arise from ethnic data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  recognising  diversity  based  on  ethnicity  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  such 
<br/>differences could lead to policies based purely on ethnicity. Dr. Sunil Kumar, Associate Professor of 
<br/>Economics at the University of the South Pacific, again he expresses the same thing.  The question I 
<br/>would like to ask is, why hide ethnic data because it is very important to know everything in terms 
<br/>of development.  We have inequalities in terms of wealth, work, qualification, education, et cetera, 
<br/>and even the places  we  stay in terms  of residences, quality  of housing, et  cetera.   There  are also 
<br/>inequalities which can be related to specifically or peculiar to particular ethnic groups.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is something which Fiji, as a multi-ethnic nation need to accept that in terms of moving 
<br/>forward  and  develop  appropriate  policies  accordingly.    That  is  something  I  would  like  to  again 
<br/></span><span>emphasise today, the Government, I know that has been expressed every now and then.  It is not their 
<br/></span><span>philosophy but I would like to remind them, why do you not want these kinds of data to be known?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Why do you want it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Let me ask you a question, when you see obvious differences in 
<br/>terms of wealth between ethnicities, do you leave it like that or do you do something in accordance 
<br/>with policy in order to address that?  For example, if you look at the number of contracts awarded by 
<br/>Government, who is it being awarded to or the number of businesses in the country or the Chamber 
<br/>of Commerce – the number of businesses owned by the different ethnic groups in Fiji?  As time goes 
<br/>on with those disparities, do you think that will create an issue in society or do you think it will create 
<br/>a  problem  later  when  those  differences  peculiar  to  ethnicity  becomes  more  obvious  or  could  it 
<br/>become problematic? I know that people try to avoid the issue, but it is something we need to grasp 
<br/>and see how we can handle it as a nation together.  That is what I would like to emphasise today as 
<br/>we move forward as a nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just are couple of points I would like to 
<br/>respond to, but before I do so, what is really interesting which is the HIES study that was compiled, 
<br/></span><span>the  honourable  Members  of  course,  have  not  gone  beyond  ethnicity  as  far  as  that  report  was 
<br/></span><span>concerned.  But the data will give you some very good information but the general observance of all 
<br/>such  surveys  worldwide  does  show,  for  example,  when  the  families  got  bigger,  the  incidence  of 
<br/>poverty actually increases.  In Fiji’s case for example, they said the poverty rate rises, the number of 
<br/>children per household increases.  The poverty rate for households with three or more children was 
<br/>44 percent is double the rate of households with only one child at 22 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Sir, if for example, the level of education, it says here where heads of households 
<br/>who  only  completed  primary  school,  the    poverty  rate  was  37.5  percent  for  those  households, 
<br/>secondary  schools  was  25.8  percent  and,  of  course  ,  the  higher  education  was  13.8  percent  and 
<br/>postgraduate studies was 5.4 percent. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some very pertinent issues 
<br/>that people need to understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the study was done at a time, the poverty estimates were reflective of the global 
<br/>economic slowdown which is already underway at the time of survey marked by lengthy geopolitical 
<br/>trade disputes and slowdown in global investment which were largely out of control.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  United  Nations’  estimate  places  a  global  growth  at  2.3  percent  in  2019.  The  lowest 
<br/>growth was of the previous decade. Honourable  Professor Prasad will not  tell  us  that when he is 
<br/>bringing this motion. That slowdown ultimately affected our economy too because we were part of 
<br/>the global community. So it is within that context that this study was done, honourable Tuisawau, 
<br/>again, try and understand this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notwithstanding  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  survey  showed  that  the  poverty  rate  was  29 
<br/>percent.  Honourable Tikoduadua again misled Parliament when he talked about absolute poverty 
<br/>and  abject  poverty.    There  are  far  more  different  categories  when  you  talk  about  poverty  levels. 
<br/>Again, the World Bank Report here in 2017 said that and I quote: “Extreme poverty in Fiji is rare. 
<br/>According to the World Bank’s measures, the 2.3 percent of the population live in extreme poverty.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course there is no doubt and I think we all can agree on this that people 
<br/>who have lower incomes now would have increased as a result of COVID-19. Over 100,000 people 
<br/>lost their jobs; we know that. As a result, what did the Government do? We provided $430 million 
<br/>of  unemployment  benefit.    Through  the  FNPF’s  general  account  when  their  funds  are  actually 
<br/>finished in their general account and then on top of that, the $90, the two rounds of $50 and the two 
<br/>rounds of $360. As highlighted by all the previous Ministers also, market vendors’ fees and the other 
<br/></span><span>types of assistance was provided to individuals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Budget, because they have again opposed, they opposed last year’s budget, they oppose 
<br/>this year’s Revised Budget.  We have given, one-off, for example, $50 payment to all social welfare 
<br/>recipients,  a  $100  one-off  payment  to  all  the  people  living  in  Vanua  Levu  including  Bua.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, all of these have been provided. Now there is no doubt, that if we may want to give 
<br/>more for people in those areas. The honourable Sakuru talked about people who cannot be caught in 
<br/>a poverty trap, et cetera.  I agree with that just on that single point and honourable Akbar has already 
<br/>highlighted this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have what we call the “graduation process”, we do not want people to fall into that.  In 
<br/>fact,  that  is  the  reason  why  the  unemployment  benefit  of  $430  million  was  not  called  poverty 
<br/>alleviation but unemployment benefit to show and tell people, the psychology of it was that this is an 
<br/>interim measure and you will get your jobs back once the borders open so people do not fall into the 
<br/>psychological trap of being completely dependent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of these things have been around and, of course, one of the points that 
<br/>the Minister for Health may have not mentioned this but the GPs now, private GPs,  we actually pay 
<br/></span><span>the fees. They get all their blood test, urine test and cholesterol test done, everything that normally 
<br/></span><span>go to a doctor - all of that is being paid for by Government and this is available for people who cannot 
<br/>afford to go to a GP in the first place. They normally will go to a nursing station, health centre or a 
<br/>public hospital. We have now expanded that as part of the Budget again. We said that we will actually 
<br/>fund private GPs to go to populated areas.  We may actually plonk one doctor along somewhere in 
<br/>the  Coral  Coast,  put  one  in  Malolo  somewhere  around  where  a  large  numbers  of  people  live,  in 
<br/>Korovuto and various other places.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> All of that is being done and I would like to recall the sentiments by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  Commerce  and  Trade.    When  we  were  giving  the  MSME  grants,  they  said,  “Oh,  handout, 
<br/>freebies.”  That was not even an election but they kept on saying that.  They did not look at these 
<br/>things holistically and as honourable Seruiratu had highlighted, that we you look at poverty, you need 
<br/>to look at it holistically honourable Qereqeretabua.  You just cannot at one particular incident. I know 
<br/>Hasan Khan, he has read that thing about the elderlies, et cetera, we all agree with that, but, of course 
<br/>what he fails to mention during his time when he was heading EFTCOS, there was no social pension 
<br/>given to people who had FNPF. A vast number of people in this country have never worked formally 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1089 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for anyone.  You go to all the maritime areas unless they have worked in a hotel, people working in 
<br/>farms, women living at their homes or working as house girls et cetera, they do not have FNPF.                                                                                                                           
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The society is changing, technology is advancing, extended families are no longer extended 
<br/>families,  they  are  nuclear  families.    As  a  recognition  of  that,  the  Bainimarama-led  Government 
<br/>introduced the $100 pension for those people initially over 70 years, and then 65 years.  You have 
<br/>couples who are over the age of 65 years get $100 each. That, obviously, is a lot better than what 
<br/>they got before, which was nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way the disability allowance, there was never any disability allowance paid in 
<br/>this country, never!  There is never any, for example, rural pregnant women getting food nutrition 
<br/>vouchers,  never!    None  of  them  have  mentioned  that.  Honourable  Salote  Radrodro  did  not  even 
<br/>mention that, none of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I  cannot  overemphasise  the  fact  that  free  education  is  now  truly 
<br/>available in Fiji.  When we actually announced that, honourable Gavoka at one point said, “Oh, it 
<br/>was available in the Ratu Mara Government”, the Leader of Paapi said, “I provided it”, then he had 
<br/>to correct himself once again.  It was not really provided, people still have to pay building fees and 
<br/></span><span>all of that. It is truly free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You actually get free transportation to schools, we get free textbooks.  Today in Fiji, there 
<br/>are far more girls in high school than boys.  There are far more females in university, than males.  
<br/>What does that mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Let us look at the overall impact of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It means that less teenage pregnancies.  It also means that our mothers are better educated 
<br/>now, get better opportunities, women empowerment takes place, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and, therefore, it 
<br/>creates a better society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that level of education does actually contribute. Again, honourable Salote 
<br/>Radrodro  talked  about  temporary  special  measures.    TSM  is  a  temporary  special  measure.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, a country that has been so beholden to a quota system in ethnicity, TSM actually would 
<br/>be in the same alignment with them.  It would have actually been an anathema to what we are trying 
<br/>to achieve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today  in  this  Parliament,  Sir,  the  percentage  of  females  is  the  highest  as  ever  been  since 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independence.  She does not recognise that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  It  is  the Electoral  System, Sir.   If we have the quality of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members of Parliament like you, obviously we do not want that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is that, under this electoral system it has allowed more 
<br/>and more females to  participate, allowed more  and more  young people to participate. Obviously, 
<br/>there are far more young people on this side of Parliament than the other side. But the fact of the 
<br/>matter is, we have got more young people in Parliament than ever before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, she failed to mention that for the first time, we had a Speaker that 
<br/>was a female, for the first time we had a Secretary to Cabinet who was a female.  At one stage, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had the Speaker to  Parliament, the Secretary-General  to  Parliament  and  the Secretary to  Cabinet, 
<br/>simultaneously three females occupying these positions, they did not utter a word.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also want to make was that the honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad  did  not  actually  talk  about  inflation.    The  USA  has  an  inflation  rate  of  7.9  percent,  not  a 
<br/>mention of that.  Not a mention of the fact that a country that is so heavily dependent on imports, will 
<br/>actually be affected by imported inflation rates.  Most definitely, we will be affected by that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not a single mention by any of the honourable Members of the Opposition about these hard-
<br/>core  realities. They talked about,  “Oh, the NFP  Manifesto,  we said  to  reduce VAT, make it zero 
<br/>percent,” at a time when they did it just before the Elections.  It was politically expedient for them to 
<br/>do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we were playing politics, Sir, our leader would have said at that time, “okay, let us play 
<br/>politics, let us also say let us reduce VAT,” but we have a principle approach to the economy, we 
<br/>have the audacity to stand up in the face of people who want to simply win votes.  We have a principle 
<br/>approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka, please do not laugh.  I am going to give you some free political advice, 
<br/></span><span>stop  aligning  yourself  with  </span><span>paapi</span><span>  because  they  are  actually  an  anathema  to  your  vote  bank. 
<br/>Remember that! They are an anathema to your vote bank and continuously for the past few days, 
<br/>SODELPA has been supporting them, that is what is going to happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point that I wanted to make was, they have actually completely did not 
<br/>mention any of that imported inflationary impact.  At the same time, they did not mention about all 
<br/>the other social wages - electricity subsidy, household less than $30,000, we pay 50 percent of your 
<br/>bill.  During COVID-19, 100 percent was paid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the household with income of less than $30,000, we pay water bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for 92,000 litres of free water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the income tax paid in this country, in 2007 when the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister became Prime Minister, the income tax threshold was $8,600. Then it became $8,800, then 
<br/>the income tax threshold went to $16,000, and today it is $30,000.  So anyone who earns less than 
<br/>$30,000 does not pay a single cent of tax.  The entire money, apart from their FNPF deduction, goes 
<br/>into their pocket.  They have not acknowledged that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate had already mentioned that.  Honourable Radrodro said we want to be 
<br/>like Norway.  In Norway, the tax rate is 50 percent and 60 percent.  In France, you pay tax on the 
<br/>number of windows you have in your house. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tax rate in Singapore is very low, 
<br/>exactly, see you got it wrong again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make was, honourable Professor Prasad mentioned about how 
<br/>we have acknowledged that cane farmers earned less.  Yes, we have already mentioned that.  In fact, 
<br/>the Cane Growers Council feels this Government paid for it.  Before even from the cane, you know 
<br/>that,  when  they  used  to  get  their  money,  the  Cane  Growers  Council  deducted  from  all  the  cane 
<br/>farmers, and this Government started paying it back in 2012 and 2013, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Not a single 
<br/>cent is paid by the cane farmer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this, none of the other political party leaders, including NFP, 
<br/>including Chaudhary, including </span><span>paapi</span><span>, including everyone else had ever acknowledged that fact, and 
<br/>to find a solution for it.  The honourable Prime Minister has said that we are going to find a solution 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1091 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to it.  This 43 percent of the cane farmers need to be assisted.  We have made an allocation in this 
<br/>Budget to help those people to get long term leases.  We made an allocation in this Budget to help 
<br/>them transition from sugarcane farming if they want to go and plant something else, or some of them 
<br/>simply  want  to  get  residential  leases, we have allocated funding for that.  The Committee on  the 
<br/>Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL), of course, continues to get renewal of leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make, was that, all of these things that 
<br/>we do is not a one-off type of event, it is done in a systematic and holistic manner.  Many of these 
<br/>have actually been highlighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation and the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts have highlighted about the fact that we have the Women’s 
<br/>Expo.  What is that doing?  It is not just a show down at the Gymnasium, but it is about connecting 
<br/>these people to markets they normally could not connect to.  It means sustained livelihood, Sir.  That 
<br/>is what we are trying to do.  It is not the two days or three days funfair thing.  It is actually creating 
<br/>jobs, opportunities and livelihoods for them, but in a sustainable manner.  That is what we are doing.  
<br/>In the same way, we reduced VAT, we did not reduce VAT at that point in time because it was not 
<br/>sustainable.  This we have to do, we look at things on a sustainable basis, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to make was, we have tried other initiatives, 
<br/>for  example,  through  FDB.    When  we  bring  the  FDB  guarantee,  they  oppose  it.    Here,  FDB’s 
<br/>guarantee is trying to assist people in the agriculture sector and the other smaller sectors.  They are 
<br/>working  closely  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  they  have  given  $1million  to  ginger 
<br/>farmers,  mainly  from  Naitasiri.    They  do  not  appreciate  and  acknowledge  that,  but  they  come  to 
<br/>Parliament, they stand up and say, “Oh”.  Honourable Radrodro does not like the ethnicity of the 
<br/>CEO.  They objected to it on so many different ways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  It  is  true,  why  did  you  say  “hey”;  it  is  a  fact.    He  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>questioned his ethnicity and he has questioned his loyalty to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, when we look at the solutions, we have to look at it from an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>entire legal framework perspective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ACCF was set up, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Before, if the head of the household, the husband 
<br/></span><span>or  the  wife  was  crossing  the  road  and  got  hit  by  a  bus  or  a  car,  livelihood  is  gone,    family  is 
<br/></span><span>languishing in poverty, so what do they do?  , They have to go through a court system.  They have to 
<br/>go and hire a lawyer.  It takes four years, five years and may be they will get compensation, may be 
<br/>they will not. The witnesses have died.  The lawyer takes away the 50 percent of the money that is 
<br/>claimed.  They do not have to do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have  got  ACCF.   It  is  a no fault system.   A person has a car accident or a road 
<br/>accident, they simply get compensated.  The family gets the money immediately, in some cases, been 
<br/>paid within a matter of days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Workers Compensation, before again you go through a lengthy process.  There was a fault 
<br/>system.  If I am working on a machine and my fingers got chopped off by the machine, the employer 
<br/>can  claim,  “Oh,  he  came  to  work  grog  doped.  He  contributed  partially  towards  his  finger  being 
<br/>chopped off.”  Now, there is no fault system.  I am at work, I get injured, I get paid through ACCF.   
<br/>These are the systematic issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that have been put in place that actually empowers 
<br/>people.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same thing with Legal Aid Commission, $5.5 million given to them.  Women who may 
<br/>be abandoned by spouses or children abandoned, they can actually go and get legal recourse.  People 
<br/>who have died without making wills, they get legal recourse and I am not talking only about people 
<br/>who are rich but I am talking about the people at the bottom of socio-economic strata in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the things that have actually been put in place to help people who are at the bottom 
<br/>end of society, which they were talking about. None of them have addressed that.  There is, in fact, 
<br/>a constitutional provision that any government that is elected must allocate adequate resources to the 
<br/>Legal Aid Commission, Sir. All of these have been put in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  honourable Salote  Radrodro,  went  on  about  the name of  ‘women’.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>irrelevant to the situation, but let me explain this to her.  This matter is actually </span><span>subjudice</span><span>. The matter 
<br/>has been debated through the courts and, again, her and the people like her, in fact, even outside court 
<br/>have tried to influence the decision of the court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a very simple issue, Sir, a birth certificate in some countries they actually call it a name 
<br/>certificate.  It is your legal name that is recognised legally.  That is your name.  If your name is Salote 
<br/>Radrodro at birth, you want to keep that name, you can keep that name.  No one is forcing you to 
<br/></span><span>change that name.  It is very simple.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before under the old system, if you want to change your name, you had to 
<br/>go to a lawyer, pay $500 or $1,000, you get a deed poll done and  then you get a name change.  Some 
<br/>countries, like I said, instead of calling it birth certificate, they call it name certificate, but it is your 
<br/>formal name that is registered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All we are saying is that, if a person has to be registered as a voter, that name should be the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legal name of that person.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has no inconvenience, it does not cost money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now she is talking about inconvenience. 
<br/>Before, she was talking about the principle of changing it.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, it does not 
<br/>cost a single cent. It simply requires you to fill out a form and it is done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  a  couple  of  points  that  I  also  wanted  to  make.  Honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau went on about ethnic desegregation of data. This country has been obsessed with ethnicity. 
<br/></span><span>The leader of PAP justified the removal of the democratically-elected government in this chamber 
<br/></span><span>with  the bullet  shot over there on the basis of ethnicity.  Since then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our  entire 
<br/>Parliament has been elected on the base of ethnicity. This is why.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember quite clearly in 2012, I think it was, when we were at Knolly Street at NDMO, 
<br/>there was a particular cyclone and the honourable Prime Minister said, “We need to help these people 
<br/>fix up their homes.”  The people at NDMO looked at him and said, “Sorry, we cannot do that.” He 
<br/>asked, why? “Because it has been a Government policy since the 1970s that we only rebuild homes 
<br/>of people who live in villages.  We do not build the homes of anyone outside the village boundary.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though you may be a villager living outside the village boundary, we do not build it for 
<br/>you.  If you are living anywhere else, we do not build it, so it is done on the basis of ethnicity also.  
<br/>This honourable Prime Minister changed the system, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point is this, poverty does not recognise ethnicity.  Poverty does not 
<br/>recognise religion.  Poverty does not recognise province. Poverty actually recognises your particular 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1093 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>condition  and  as  Government,  we  need  to  be  able  to  help  anyone  irrespective  of  their  ethnicity, 
<br/>religion or province to get them out of it, to provide assistance to them.  But if you are going to be 
<br/>beholden to that idea, you will continue to drive your policies based to ethnicity, and it will drive into 
<br/>or  permeate  into  every  single  strata  of  your  society.  That  is  what  will  happen.    You  will  make 
<br/>decisions based on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember, Sir, in 2007, when we came to Government, someone said, “Oh, we are going to 
<br/>appoint these people.”  You know what they did in the Ministry of Economy at that time, they said, 
<br/>“Oh, this many Fijians, this many Indians, this many Others.”  So let us appoint people to make it a 
<br/>bit balanced.”  Nothing about merit, nothing about the person they want to appoint is going to do a 
<br/>good job or not, they are going to do </span><span>dinmaro</span><span> or what?  Are you going to be </span><span>vucesa? </span><span>No.  Their 
<br/>capability, their qualification?  No.  The only qualification was ethnicity.  How can you run a modern 
<br/>day government if you have that kind of thinking?  This is the reason why this Government actually 
<br/>opposes  that.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  diversity  happens  automatically,  you  look  at  the  civil  service,  it 
<br/>happens automatically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I also wanted to make was 
<br/>this – there are structural issues also (just to highlight) to poverty.  I remember after the 1987 </span><span>coup,</span><span>
<br/>the Rabuka Government made a decree, I think at that point in time.  They said that if anyone was 
<br/>caught even with a milligram of </span><span>marijuana</span><span> had to go in for three months mandatory sentence.  That 
<br/>was the law then, they have brought in mandatory sentencing, forget about alcohol but </span><span>marijuana,</span><span>
<br/>even a milligram.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember, Sir, in one of those courts in the High Court, I was representing the DPP’s Office 
<br/>and there were four prisoners who were in fact appealing their sentence and the story goes this way. 
<br/>This one of them who was extremely intelligent was in fact quite aggressive.  I remember talking to 
<br/>the prison warden on that same evening and his story was this that he was sent to prison for a minor 
<br/>sentence; none of this Yellow Ribbon or all of these rehabilitation work - minor incident.  He was 
<br/>raped in prison very badly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since then, Sir, psychologically, he went at the age of 17 years or 18 years and remember the 
<br/>mandatory sentencing applied only to while it worked out, because the DPP’s Office did an analysis, 
<br/></span><span>most of the people who ended going to prison for that particular offence came from the lower-end of 
<br/></span><span>the socio-economic scale. The guy who had his first sniff behind the toilet or underneath the coconut 
<br/>tree, not the rich children who drive around in their cars or go to Traps, et cetera.  It was these children 
<br/>who got caught. He was very badly raped and then psychologically he was affected.  He was beholden 
<br/>to  the prison system.    From  the age of 17  years to  the age of 34  years or 36  years when he  first 
<br/>appeared, where I appeared with him in the High Court, he had been in and out of prison for about 
<br/>17 years to 18 years.  It was like a revolving door for him, and Mr. Speaker, Sir.  He had been released 
<br/>from Korovou at 10 that morning, at 2 p.m. he was robbing a yacht, a German gentleman with a local 
<br/>girlfriend.  They put so much stuff in the dinghy to go across to Lami, it sank.  Funny but actually 
<br/>quite tragic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  what  you  call  systemic  poverty,  what  is  what  leads  to  systemic 
<br/>poverty, systemic injustices, that is what happens.  We get condemned every time for Yellow Ribbon, 
<br/>we got condemned about our prisoners getting connected to employers, et cetera.  That is what leads 
<br/>to society becoming dysfunctional, they do not talk about any of those things.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to also make, honourable Salote Radrodro with her 
<br/>obsession with USP aligns the non-grant giving by the Fijian Government to USP as an affront to 
<br/>education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- See!  Mr. Speaker, Sir, she completely forgets as I have just 
<br/>mentioned ECE to Year 13 free, bus fares, text books all free.  Toppers and TELS – USP still gets 
<br/>Toppers and TELS students from the Fijian Government, still funded by the Fijian Government and 
<br/>they want us to give grant to a system that is not being accountable and transparent.  For them it is a 
<br/>political issue, it has got nothing to do with poverty and again this is the kind of shenanigans that we 
<br/>get in this Parliament, these very pedestrian kind of contributions to these type of debates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Pedestrian? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, you should learn it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was, honourable Tuisawau I want 
<br/></span><span>to come to you too.  He said that we should have ethnic categorisation.  It is the homogenisation of 
<br/></span><span>ethnification that what leads to problems because when you start lumping people into different ethnic 
<br/>groups, you do not recognise the intra-injustices that exist within those groups. That is precisely what 
<br/>happened  with  women  when  you  used  to  it.    That  is  precisely  what  happens,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>between urban </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people and rural </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people.  That is precisely what happened when under 
<br/>the  homogenisation  category,  Class  A  Shares  went  to  all  the  elite  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  to  get  shares  in  Fijian 
<br/>Holdings Ltd, Class B went to the provinces and they get paid lower dividends.  It is a fact. Do not 
<br/>shake your head.  This Prime Minister provided equal dividend payments.  This Prime Minister did.  
<br/>He is doing this, I want the public to say, he is doing this, like do not say it, let us hide it under the 
<br/>carpet.  That is what it does, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point that I would like to make, related to that, there has been a lot 
<br/>of talk about empowering people.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government, through this Prime Minister, 
<br/>through  stable  leadership  has  provided  stability  to  this  country  and  funding  for  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The honourable Prime Minister in two weeks’ time is going 
<br/></span><span>to do ground-breaking in another two places -  Tavua and Viseisei.  There are four about to come on 
<br/>stream.  This is what you call actually taking a systemic issue and trying to address it in a systematic 
<br/>manner because this will actually empower these landowners.  So this whole notion of asset-rich, 
<br/>cash-poor will actually go out the window.  This is providing funding to people who actually are 
<br/>deprived of those access to funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  in  all  I  would  like  to  mention  also  that  whenever  these  motions  are 
<br/>brought about, I hope honourable Professor Prasad and I know you are going to address this in your 
<br/>summing-up, unfortunately  you have a right  to  do so.  The point I wanted to  make  is  that this is 
<br/>actually,  and  Minister  Akbar  hit  the  nail  on  the  head  when  she  said  that  if  honourable  Professor 
<br/>Prasad was so concerned about poverty, why is he bringing it now?  Why did he not do it earlier on?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian public needs to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is all a political stunt.  It is a political 
<br/>stunt to try and gain lost ground because honourable Professor Prasad does know that he is down on 
<br/>a slippery slope and it is a sign of desperation.  In the process, Sir, he is not only creating disquiet in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this House but disquiet amongst the community.  I hope people understand that leaders like this, they 
<br/>are most definitely not the proud specimen of what a statesperson should do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  should  be  concerned  about  our  country.    We  should  be  genuinely 
<br/>concerned about the country for whom you are bringing the motion for and in that way, we will be 
<br/>able to deliver a lot better services to our members of the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, as usual that was expected from the Government 
<br/>side.    They  meandered,  they  wandered,  they  lied,  they  lied  and  they  saw  this  opportunity  in  this 
<br/>motion to actually brag about things that they have done before. They actually misunderstood the 
<br/>motion completely and I was quite surprised that they did not object to this motion in the Business 
<br/>Committee and I tell you why.  They saw an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, in this motion to brag about 
<br/>what Government has done since 2014.  They saw an opportunity to actually lie and the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General just said that we are trying to play politics.  They have done exactly the same thing.  
<br/>They have fallen into the trap, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was expecting them to look at this motion and understand that this motion was to look at 
<br/>what has happened since the COVID-19 pandemic hit us and build on, Mr. Speaker, from the report 
<br/></span><span>that we had.  But, no.  They forgot about it, they have misinterpreted and they went on and on and 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister for Education actually told a naked lie, she should apologise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  remember,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  I  spoke  on  the  Budget,  I  said  this  very  clearly,  it  is 
<br/>recorded in the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>that I support this Budget for three reasons and that was that we were: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Reducing VAT on basic food items and other essentials; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Removing the tax on fuel;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Raising the minimum wages; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which has been a National Federation Party policy for a while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  did  not  acknowledge,  they  actually 
<br/>copied the list of items in the same order.  Instead of saying, “hey look, this is what you were saying.”  
<br/>It does not stop here, let me just get back to what they were saying that we are using this as a political 
<br/>tool, that we are making a political gain and that we are not honest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had it in their manifesto.  They promised the people of this 
<br/>country that they will not remove VAT from those basic food items.  It was in their manifesto and 
<br/>they went into the election on that manifesto.  They lied, they ridiculed the VAT reduction that I was 
<br/>proposing.  They ridiculed with their business cabal the idea of raising the minimum wages and then 
<br/>they come back and say that we are playing politics.  The honourable Minister for Social Welfare, as 
<br/>I said, she tries very hard and I want to acknowledge and she is quite responsive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Do not patronise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I am not patronising.  This  is the problem with  you.   I am 
<br/>actually telling the truth that she responds, but I have heard her before, she talks about how poor we 
<br/>were.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lies they continue to tell, I come from a farming background, I went to a 
<br/>primary school in Muanidevo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Again, again.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We had remission of fees, I got remission of fees right up to 
<br/>Labasa  College  and  that  was  during  the  reign  of  the  Ratu  Mara  Government  and  the  NFP  in 
<br/>Opposition.  We got scholarships, thousands of students of all ethnic groups in this country since 
<br/>Independence  got  scholarships,  loans,  got  their  degrees  and  studying.    Of  course,  Government 
<br/>improved it, more students are getting loans now, they have to pay and we acknowledge that, but to 
<br/>keep bragging about the fact that suddenly, the sun started shining on the education system in this 
<br/>country since the Bainimarama-led Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This level of exaggeration is just unbelievable, they do not 
<br/>have  the  honesty,  they  do  not  have  any  kind  of  integrity  to  be  at  least  honest.    They  talk  about 
<br/>intellectual honesty, the intellectual dishonesty that comes from the other side is breathtaking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to the Poverty Report, the people in this country are listening to the debate on 
<br/>this motion from the other side.  They are talking about things that they started doing before COVID.  
<br/>They are questioning about, how we are saying that 50 percent of the people.  If you look at that 
<br/>Report, if they read it correctly, I know they condemned this report and I was caught surprised that 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Attorney-General was saying that there are some good things in that report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a Minister who did not even understand the difference between a survey and a 
<br/>census and was trying to condemn the report.  Let me just go back to the report.  The report says that 
<br/>poverty rate is about 29.9 percent to 30 percent, but the report also said that about 15 percent to 20 
<br/>percent of the people who are vulnerable, on the margins of poverty, Mr. Speaker, and after COVID-
<br/>19, we all know that about $150,000 people lost jobs and income.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- They are getting it back again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Some of them are getting it back again but a large majority 
<br/>are still unemployed. The rationale behind the Motion was to give the Standing Committee in which 
<br/>they have three Members, they have their Chairperson, to look at what is happening right now.  You 
<br/>can talk about  these reports and assessments.  The buffoonery that came from that side about  this 
<br/>whole issue of poverty, Mr. Speaker, I am actually quite amazed at the level of stupidity that came 
<br/>with respect to this Motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  we  know  the  causes  of  poverty,  the  World  Bank  Report  and  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister  for  Defence  was  quoting  the  2017  Report.  We  understand  that,  but  the  objective  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Motion, Mr. Speaker, was to look at what had happened since COVID-19. Where are the people? 
<br/>What is happening?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what the motion was and I had explained to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1097 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not want to talk about the people who are struggling to put food on 
<br/>the table.  Let me tell them this, before the COVID-19 pandemic, 2.0 percent of the children in this 
<br/>country were deprived of three meals a day. Imagine what would have happened after the </span><span>Coup</span><span>? It 
<br/>talks about the size of the family - 40 percent of those living in poverty have seven or more in the 
<br/>family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report provides this useful barometer and what I was saying that this 
<br/>Committee should do is to go around the country and talk to various stakeholders and honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua gave this example. I went to Narere the other day.  This little group, because they 
<br/>know they are living in the community and they understand that people are struggling to put food on 
<br/>their tables and kids are struggling three meals a day, these people organise themselves to help them. 
<br/>And the reason why we have brought this Motion is because we have been told this and we saw this.  
<br/>They know this as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When Ministers go, people are kind of afraid, they do not want to raise this issue. But they 
<br/>also call them because they come and tell us, “We have called this Minister, that Minister.”  They 
<br/>know this, but yet for political expediency and purposes, they come here and brag about the fact that 
<br/>they have that, instead of saying, “This is a good Motion.”   All they had to say is that, and the debate 
<br/></span><span>would have ended.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have said that we wanted a select committee but the ruling was the 
<br/>Standing Committees.  The honourable Minister for Commerce did not even know that the Motion 
<br/>was about getting the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to do the inquiry and not the a select 
<br/>committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  it  was  a  very  simple  yet  useful  Motion  because  people  out  there  are  suffering,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, and Government does not have all the information.  It was like people in the evacuation 
<br/>centres.  The honourable Minister for Defence said, “Oh, they have to wait for 48 hours”, but people 
<br/>are starving there,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If it had not been for the NGOs, they would have….   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, people do not have food and yet, you are talking about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a policy? This is the kind of response they get?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Commerce,  I think had said  in the previous 
<br/>Parliament, “Oh, people are not suffering.” That is the kind of mentality of not being able to see or 
<br/>want to understand that they need to find more information because as I have said this morning, the 
<br/>trust in this Government is declining.  Honourable Bala was saying, “Oh, this motion might backfire 
<br/>on you,” and that is what they did.  They thought, “Oh, this is a great opportunity, let us all come, let 
<br/>us get the Ministers and brag about what they did from 2014.”  We have acknowledged some of the 
<br/>good things that Government has done, no one is saying that they have not done anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every Government, Mr. Speaker, whatever size, shape or form, has done something.  They 
<br/>have built roads, hospitals, they provided education, they do not acknowledge that.  But on a motion 
<br/>like this, they come and brag about it, instead of focusing on the real issues.

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when they talked about  tax threshold before the 2018  Election and they 
<br/>said, “Oh, anyone who is earning $30,000 does not pay tax.”  But they actually paid tax, the indirect 
<br/>forms of taxes, they pay VAT, they pay duty, so everything that this Government provides to the 
<br/>people of this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is paid for by the people of this country.  When you provide 
<br/>services, when you give social pension, people are paying for it. So, let us not  come out here and 
<br/>return, and add salt to injury of the poor saying, “Oh, we are doing this.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you say that the Government is doing it, that is the Government’s responsibility and people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are paying for it.

<div><span>They  talked  about  the  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Council  levy.  I  know  why  they  did  that.  
<br/>Honourable Dr. Waqainabete was talking about roads being built and medical services, yes, that may 
<br/>be true, but you go and look at all the medical centres around the country right now.  I mean, I went 
<br/>to Dreketi and I went inside the Health Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I remember in the 1970s when you go there, you see all these white stones, the 
<br/>walls are painted, the shed where people wait was something to go.  You can smell the cleanliness 
<br/>and see the flowers.  , you go to that Health Centre now, the doctor was sitting in the room where 
<br/>tiles have broken and where the dust was blowing.  You can built roads but you need to provide the 
<br/>facilities as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. S. Adimaitoga interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-This is about poverty, this is about a certain category of people 
<br/>in certain areas who are suffering and that is why we are saying after COVID-19 the situation is dire, 
<br/>let us have this assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  they  talked  about,  “oh,  it  is  going  to  be  very  expensive.”  </span><span>Areh</span><span>,  there  are 
<br/>Ministers  who  drink  grog  and  the  driver  is  waiting  for  them,  paying  hundreds  and  thousands    of 
<br/>dollars a year and you want to say that having a Standing Committee and going around the country 
<br/>for two weeks is going to be very expensive?  Is that the kind of logic that they are talking about?  
<br/>Wastage your Parliament’s time?  I mean that is the kind of logic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they use to 
<br/>reject this motion when we need to find out that information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is just so much exaggeration that is coming out from the Government 
<br/>side is  just  unbelievable.   They talk about  the policies.  In fact,  for a while, we thought  we were

<div><span>debating in the last Budget, because all they were talking about is the budget allocation.  Sometimes, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, just having budgetary allocations and we know, that having budgetary allocations does 
<br/>not  mean  that  the  people  are  actually  getting  the  services.    There  are  hundreds  and  thousands  of 
<br/>people out there when they hear the Ministers talk in Parliament, they said, “Oh this is very good”, 
<br/>but after a while when they find out that it is not reaching them, it is the accessibility and  ability of 
<br/>the Ministry to spend the money, to get to the people and help them.  That is what we are saying, that 
<br/>this Standing Committee would have been able to find out some of the bottlenecks.  They would have 
<br/>listened to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we talk about the NGOs, they have this obsession with NGOs.  This is the problem 
<br/>with this Government.  They have this obsession with NGOs because they are doing their work.  They 
<br/>attack people who are doing the work. The motion was that that this Standing Committee would be 
<br/>able to talk to them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know the honourable Attorney-General meanders in different directions and obviously, he 
<br/>has now found a new word, </span><span>paapi</span><span>, but let me tell him that in the last Budget, he said, “I have joined 
<br/>the </span><span>paapi.”</span><span> Mr. Speaker, to explain the word,  </span><span>paapi</span><span>, it means a sinner.  He said, “Oh, it was the 
<br/>Freudian slip, but no, he said it three times, and then he said, “Oh, Biman has joined the </span><span>paapi</span><span>.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me tell the honourable Attorney-General, we are in  the </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span>
<br/>celebration, we are in the month of </span><span>Ramadan</span><span> and we are in the month of Lent, this is a very holy and 
<br/>auspicious time and for him to call someone a </span><span>paapi,</span><span> a sinner, and for him to say that I have joined 
<br/>the </span><span>paapi</span><span>, that I somehow have committed a sin, but the bigger sin, the </span><span>paap,</span><span> the </span><span>gunah</span><span> that they 
<br/>have committed on the people of this country is by not supporting a very simple motion to find out 
<br/>what is going on with the people. The ruin, the </span><span>paapi</span><span>, the sin that they are committing is that they 
<br/>have not done that.  They are trying to  create this, in fact, it is quite insulting for the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General to talk about it.  I mean, it is like a little kid misbehaving and saying this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to say to him and this is my advice, “Act your age, not your shoe size”, because for 
<br/>you to ridicule leaders of political parties to say that we are somehow sinners, Mr. Speaker, I do not 
<br/>stoop that low, I do not go around saying that they are </span><span>paapi</span><span>, they did this.  I would never say that.  
<br/>You should tell your </span><span>de facto</span><span> leader not to do that, honourable Prime Minister.  I would never stoop 
<br/>that low, Mr. Speaker.      I have never,  I  will never do this in  Parliament  and  I  will never do this 
<br/>outside.   Here is a man, who has accused a whole political party with thousands of members in that 
<br/>political party, accusing them as sinners.  Those who want to corporate, work together are also sinners 
<br/>because their record, Mr. Speaker, is one of dictatorship and they want to continue like that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Shut up and sit down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not say shut up, honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are not the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are the Prime Minister, you have that respect but do not say shut up.  That is unbecoming 
<br/>of a Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker.  I will never say that to the Prime Minister because I respect the 
<br/>position.
