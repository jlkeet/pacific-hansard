<div><span>Review Report - Housing Authority 2016-2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Report  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs on the Annual Review of the Housing Authority for 2016 and 2017.  This 
<br/>review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) which mandates the Committee to 
<br/>look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee first met to deliberate in May of this year and formulated questions pertaining to 
<br/>the Annual Reports which were sent to Housing Authority for its response.  Upon receipt of all relevant 
<br/>information on the Committee’s queries, the Committee compiled its findings and subsequently endorsed 
<br/>its report in June.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The year 2017 has been another progressive year for the Housing Authority recording a

<div><span>surplus  of  $1.70  million  in  comparison  to  $1.473  million  recorded  in  2016.    The  financial 
<br/>performance drivers were revenue from sale of lots and interest income from mortgage loan portfolio. 
<br/>A total of 107 lots in 2017 compared to 381 lots sold in 2016, 19 customers were assisted under the 
<br/>Social Housing Policy Scheme during the year. The scheme is directed to assist qualifying customers 
<br/>who are in financial distress and find difficulty in maintaining their repayments over the years. Total 
<br/>customer debt forgiven in 2017 was $0.565 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that the major challenges facing the Housing Authority is to provide housing that 
<br/>low  income  families  can  afford.  As  such,  the  Authority  has  strengthened  its  Land  and  Housing 
<br/>Development  Division  and  going  forward,  it  intends  to  pursue  design  and  build  initiative.  This 
<br/>initiative  aims  to  save  customers’  time  and  effort  in  constructing  their  homes  after  they  have 
<br/>purchased lots. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Housing Authority strives to ensure that Fijians have access to decent, affordable and 
<br/>quality housing for their families as provided under Section 35 of the 2013 Fijian Constitution. It has 
<br/>set a new platform and strategic direction that will guide it towards achieving its vision of providing 
<br/>affordable homes for all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Chief Executive Officer of Housing Authority, Mr. Ritesh 
<br/></span><span>Singh and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process. I also extend my gratitude to my 
<br/>Committee colleagues namely honourable George Vegnathan (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Alipate 
<br/>Nagata,  honourable  Salote  Radrodro  and  honourable  Ratu  Tevita  Navurelevu  who  substituted  for 
<br/>honourable Dr. Ratu Atonio Lalabalavu for their contributions during the Committee’s deliberations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report.

<div><span>Review Report – Ministry of Agriculture 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Review Report of the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Annual Reports.  The Committee is grateful to the management 
<br/>and staff of the Ministry of Agriculture for their commitment and endless support of its stakeholders that 
<br/>enabled the Ministry to achieve its key mandated objectives for the periods under review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Ministry  had  aligned to its relevant  outcomes identified in the 
<br/>Government’s 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan, Ministry of Agriculture 5-Year Strategic 
<br/>Development  Plan  (2019-2023),  Green  Growth,  National  Climate  Change  Policy  and  National 
<br/>Adaptation  Plans.    With  the  vision  of  “a  modernized  agriculture  sector  providing  food  and  income 
<br/>security for all Fijians” and its mission is “to excel in the provision of customer focused and market driven

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>services in the agricultural sector”, the Ministry embarked.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2017-2018 Financial Year was a challenging one for the Ministry as they were still trying to 
<br/>recover from the devastating impact of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> on Fiji’s agriculture sector.  This demands for rapid 
<br/>rehabilitation  process  which  is  highlighted  in  the  2016-2017  Annual  Report  which  will  ensure 
<br/>achievement of the Ministry’s mandated functions – quick economic recovery, food and income security, 
<br/>poverty alleviation and sustainable management of natural resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the challenges and other constraints, the Committee noted that the staff of the Ministry 
<br/>have continued to improve their performance addressing issues affecting the development of the sector 
<br/>whilst identifying and exploring opportunities that are available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee wishes to commend the Permanent Secretary for Agriculture 
<br/>and  the  senior  officers  of  the  Ministry  for  their  contribution  towards  the  final  compilation  of  the 
<br/>Committee’s Report to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not the least, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Committee namely honourable Jale Sigarara (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Alexander O’Connor, 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Mitieli  Bulanauca  and  honourable  Jese  Saukuru  for  the  successful  compilation  of  this 
<br/></span><span>bipartisan Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I commend this Report to Parliament

<div><span>Review Report – Public Rental Board 2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Report  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Public Rental Board (PRB) for 2018.  This 
<br/>review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) which mandates the Committee to 
<br/>look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee first met to deliberate in May of this year and formulated questions pertaining to 
<br/>the Annual Report which were sent to PRB for its response. Upon receipt of all relevant information on 
<br/>the Committee’s queries, the Committee compiled its findings and subsequently endorsed its Report in 
<br/>June. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the PRB, the year in review mainly focused on planning and re-strategising to deliver on 
<br/>Government’s vision of providing affordable, quality and appropriate rental housing for all Fijians. As 
<br/>such, the Board focused its efforts on developments to deliver one of the most basic needs to

<div><span>low and middle income families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Board recorded a total comprehensive income of $764,772 in 2018 as compared to $851,207 
<br/>in 2017. The total operating revenue increased by 1.24 percent in 2018, similarly the total expenditure 
<br/>increased in 2018 by 4.17 percent as compared to 2017. The Board also implemented the Job Evaluation 
<br/>recommendation for its staff members undertaken by PWC in 2017.  The Board continued to promote 
<br/>and  sustain  community  developments  through  estate  meetings,  community  awareness  and  estate 
<br/>beautifications. These have enabled the estate communities to form youth groups, women groups and 
<br/>estate committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that the 2018 year also presented some challenges to PRB. Amongst others, the most 
<br/>notable were the rising maintenance costs of PRB flats and the difficulty faced in sourcing finance from 
<br/>the financial markets to fund planned capital projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the General Manager of the Public Rental Board, Mr. Timoci 
<br/>Naleba and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process. I also extend my gratitude to my 
<br/>Committee colleagues namely, honourable George Vegnathan (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Alipate 
<br/>Nagata,  honourable  Salote  Radrodro  and  honourable  Ratu  Tevita  Navurelevu  who  substituted  for 
<br/></span><span>honourable Dr. Ratu Atonio Lalabalavu for their contributions during the Committee’s deliberations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Committee Review Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) 2017 Annual Report.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  oversight  function  is  to  scrutinise  government  departments  with

<div><span>Firstly, I wish to thank the Chairperson and the Board Members of the Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji who during the period under review, drove the Authority towards service excellence in delivering 
<br/>clean  water  and  sanitation  for  all  Fijians.  Sir,  WAF  undertook  the  initiative  in  response  to 
<br/>Government’s Initiatives set out in the National Development Plan. The Committee noted that the 
<br/>initiative was the central guiding theme of the Water Authority of Fiji’s Strategic Plan 2017–2019.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the major highlights during the review period are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Water Authority of Fiji  received an  award of the  2017 Global  Water Awards for its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>water champion programme. 
<br/>] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Water Authority of Fiji received US$31 billion grant from the Green Climate Fund, a 
<br/>component  towards  US$4  million  or  US$5  million  investments  from  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government, ADB/EIP to develop the Suva/Nausori Water Supply system which would 
<br/>result in improved water services for close to 400,000 people.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Carbon credit for greenhouse gas reduction, Water Authority of Fiji claims $350,000 
<br/>from ADB by reducing emissions at 22,000 tonnes.from ADB by reducing emissions at

<br/>growth and providing all Fijians access to better and efficient service delivery as per SDG 
<br/>6 - Clean Water and Sanitisation.  Overall, the performance of WAF during the period under 
<br/>review was satisfactory, despite the challenges and constraints faced by WAF.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not the least, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Committee who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report, namely; Hon. Jale

<div><span>Review Report - Electoral Commission 2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to start with the statement, ‘The right to free 
<br/>and fair elections is a key component of any democracy.’  The right is enshrined in Article 21 of the 
<br/></span><span>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “the will of the people shall be the basis of the 
<br/></span><span>authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections, which shall be by 
<br/>universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, elections in Fiji are governed by the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and the 
<br/></span><span>Electoral Act of 2014.  The Electoral Commission is the constitutionally mandated independent electoral 
<br/></span><span>management body in Fiji that oversees the running and conducting of free and fair elections.

<div><span> Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2187 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee’s Report tabled this morning covers the Committee’s review of the 
<br/>Electoral  Commission  Annual  Report  for  the  year  2018,  which  was  referred  to  my  Committee,  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, in February 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the review, the Committee identified some main areas of discussion that 
<br/>form its key findings from the review and which are addressed in the Committee’s Report, and these 
<br/>include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Electoral Commission has given an opportunity to all Fijians, even those who 
<br/>reside in very remote locations, to be able to vote.  This has been achieved through having 
<br/>pre-poll as part of the electoral system in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  Electoral  Commission  achieved  a  great  milestone  by  successfully  conducting 
<br/>another election after the D’hondt system was first introduced in the 2014 General Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Electoral  Commission  is  commended  for  being  able  to  address  the  challenges 
<br/>encountered in the 2018 General Election, which includes the spread of false news about 
<br/>the Election via social media and the bad weather conditions that hampered certain voters 
<br/></span><span>from being able to vote on Election Day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral Commission is commended for its transparent system for selecting the 3-digit 
<br/>numbers to be used for candidate numbers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Electoral  Commission  is  commended  for  its  Election  awareness  and  outreach 
<br/>programmes for the year 2018, especially the ‘Know Your Election’ programme, which 
<br/>were conducted in both, urban and rural areas, inclusive of villages, communities and 
<br/>schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2018 General Election had a reasonable voter turnout when compared with other 
<br/>neighbouring Pacific Island countries that have a similar electoral system to that of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  noted  that  there  was  insufficient  gender-related  information  provided  in  the 
<br/>Annual  Report,  however,  after  seeking  clarification,  the  Committee  commends  the 
<br/>work carried out by the Commission in empowering women and girls and promoting 
<br/>gender equality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these findings were realised after extensive discussions between the Committee 
<br/></span><span>and the Commission  on  pertinent  matters identified from the Annual  Report, and  I would like to 
<br/>mention a few key points from these discussions which, I believe, will help honourable Members of 
<br/>this august Parliament and the public in clearing some of the lingering questions they may have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of inclusion and participation of all Fijians in the Election,  the Commission advised 
<br/>that there are certain initiatives that are being planned which it believes contributes to and promotes 
<br/>equal opportunities for all persons, including women, girls and marginalised persons, participating 
<br/>in election, and these include:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral Commission advised, at the time of providing the response, that it will have 
<br/>induction  programmes  for  new  political  parties  that  will  include  awareness  on  women 
<br/>inclusiveness in political participation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Electoral  Commission  advised,  at  the  time  of  providing  the  response,  that  it  will 
<br/>conduct workshops on inclusivity with political parties.

<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral Commission advised, at the time of providing the response, that it will work 
<br/>with  Civil  Society  Organisations  in  developing  voter  awareness  on  the  importance  of 
<br/>women participation in elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission’s work  in improving  participation of all  Fijians  by increasing support 
<br/>towards  improved  access  and  participation  in  the  electoral  process,  for  persons  with 
<br/>disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to pre-poll, Mr. Speaker, it was noted that this allows voters to physically vote in 
<br/>advance of the polling day, due to specific grounds which are covered by the Electoral Act 2014, 
<br/>which include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the remoteness of the locality of where the voter resides; 
<br/>the number  of voters residing in  a  locality  is insufficient  for  establishment  of  a  polling 
<br/>station; or 
<br/>a voter being - 
<br/>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>member of the Disciplined Forces; 
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under pre-trial detention or sentence of imprisonment; or 
<br/></span><span>in any other place approved by the Electoral Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a resident of a nursing home or healthcare facility; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker; it should also be noted that the criteria and guidelines for identifying pre-poll 
<br/>venues are set by the Commission with close collaboration with the Fijian Elections Office, whereby 
<br/>one of the key criteria is remoteness, and this is defined in the Fijian Elections Office Operations 
<br/>Guidelines which states that ‘remoteness’ means – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Located in maritime zones;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>More than three hours of travel from an area office; and  
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not accessible by road.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A venue that is used for polling or pre-polling is set by a Polling Venue Selection Committee 
<br/>which,  in  2018,  reviewed  and  approved  the  recommended  polling  venues  for  the  2018  General 
<br/>Election and consisted of staff from the Fijian Elections Office, the Director of Operations (Fiji Police 
<br/>Force)  and  Director  Geospatial  from  the  Ministry  of  Lands.    The  role  of  this  Committee  was  to 
<br/>recommend to the Supervisor of Elections the list of polling venues to be used for the 2018 General 
<br/>Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there were also numerous comments on the inclusion of essential services staff 
<br/>as part of pre-poll which the Electoral Commission opposed, given the important services provided 
<br/>by essential services personnel and that the implications of having to remove them from their place 
<br/>of work to join a line to vote either on election day or in pre-poll is potentially disastrous to public 
<br/>welfare. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in 2018, the Electoral Commission appreciated the necessity of not disrupting 
<br/>essential services and recognising that these individuals be away from their assigned polling stations 
<br/></span><span>on polling day.  Thus, through consultations with the various essential services organisations, it was 
<br/></span><span>agreed that their staff, who are also registered voters, apply for postal voting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to also enlighten Parliament and members of the public about the 
<br/>main challenges faced by the Electoral Commission during the Election year in 2018 and how these 
<br/></span><span>were addressed.  The Committee was advised that one of main challenges faced by the Commission 
<br/></span><span>was the spread of false information about the Election on social media and various other platforms.

<div><span>This saw the considerable effort and resources diverted to counter false information with accurate 
<br/>and credible information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission also had to deal with various political leaders who also produced articles 
<br/>that  attempted  to  undermine  the  credibility  of  the  Elections.    Futile  attempts  had  been  made  to 
<br/>discredit  the  results,  however,  quick  actions  by  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  ensured  that  the 
<br/>misinformation  was  quickly  identified  and  clarified.    The  other  main  issue  was  the  bad  weather 
<br/>condition on Election day that affected the turnout in the Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of deciding the numbers for the ball roll, the Committee noted that 
<br/>the Commission believed that applying any of the set of 3-digits numbers from the 2014 General 
<br/>Elections in the 2018 General Elections would confuse the voters and thus, to prevent that confusion 
<br/>for the 2018 General Elections, the Electoral Commission decided to use a ball draw system, similar 
<br/>to the National Candidates Ball draw, to select the first 3-digits in the ballot paper.  The process took 
<br/>away any illusion of bias in the selection of the first 3-digit numbers and the draw would be done 
<br/>live on television and the internet, and be carried out by a blindfolded person in the presence of a 
<br/>Police Officer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also highlighted from the review the increase 
<br/></span><span>in the number of voters who did not turn up in the 2018 General Elections.  The Committee saw this 
<br/>as an opportunity to focus on the positive aspect of this issue and conducted a comparative analysis 
<br/>on a jurisdictional basis, to see how well the voter turnout for Fiji’s Election was when compared to 
<br/>other Pacific Island countries with similar electoral system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee took note of New Zealand and Kiribati, since these two countries are similar 
<br/>to Fiji’s electoral system whereby voting is not compulsory.  It was noted that compared to those two 
<br/>countries, Fiji’s voter turnout is reasonable, whereby in New Zealand it was 79.75 percent and in 
<br/>Kiribati, it was 75.67 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the conclusion of the review, the Committee commends the Commission 
<br/>for their tremendous achievements in 2018.  However, the Committee believes that it is prudent to 
<br/>provide  the  following  recommendation  for  consideration  by  the  Electoral  Commission,  that  the 
<br/>Electoral Commission, through the Fijian Elections Office, continues with its advocacy programmes 
<br/>on elections which are in line with the Office’s Strategic Plan 2020-2023 whereby one such goal is 
<br/>to strengthen electoral participation through effective outreach and engagement programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Members of 
<br/></span><span>the Standing Committee on Justice Law and Human Rights - honourable Rohit Sharma, honourable 
<br/>Mosese Bulitavu, honourable Dr. Salik Govind, honourable Mikaele Leawere, and former Member, 
<br/>honourable Ratu Suliano Matanitobua, for their deliberation and input, and the alternate Members 
<br/>who made themselves available when substantive Members could not attend, and the Secretariat for 
<br/>their support.  Also, acknowledging the representatives of Fiji’s electoral management bodies, who 
<br/>kindly  answered  the  Committee’s  request  and  made  themselves  available  to  answer  pertinent 
<br/>questions which assisted the Committee in its work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  also  takes  this  opportunity  to  commend  the  Electoral  Commission  for 
<br/>conducting  a  successful  fair  and  transparent  2018  General  Elections.    The  Committee  notes  the 
<br/>tremendous effort placed by the former Chairperson, Mr. Suresh Chandra, and other Commissioners 
<br/>in conducting a just and fair Election, even though on the day of Election, mother nature was not in 
<br/>favour, nor gave a conducive environment to conduct a smooth and hindrance-free Election in 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, on behalf of the Committee, table this Report to Parliament and commend

<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(5),  I  hereby 
<br/>move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Review Report on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is grateful to the Management and staff of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources for their commitment that enabled the Ministry to achieve its key-mandated objectives for 
<br/>the periods under review.  During the period under review, the Committee noted that the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources administrates all State land and regulates all mineral resources in Fiji, 
<br/>with the aim to ensure that all State land, minerals and the groundwater sector is sustainable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  two  Departments  -  the  Lands  and  Surveys  Department  and  the  Mineral 
<br/>Resources Department.  The Lands Department’s programmes and activities are designed to provide 
<br/>the administration, development and management of all State land, including the foreshore, while the 
<br/>Mineral  Resources Department  works towards providing access  to  available groundwater sources 
<br/>that  are  present  for  human  consumption,  and  are  developed  through  properly-conducted 
<br/>hydrogeological  investigation  and  assessment  with  quality  boreholes.  In  addition,  managing 
<br/>groundwater sources to ensure sustainability, with minimum impact on the environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two Departments were supported by the Corporate Services Division and the Policy and 
<br/></span><span>Research Unit. A highlight of the Ministry’s Corporate Division during the years under review was 
<br/>the  preliminary  work  facilitated  on  the  review  of  the  organisational  restructure  and  the 
<br/>decentralisation of authorities on finance and budget implementation.  The Division also set up the 
<br/>Training Unit to coordinate human resource management and Post Processing Unit to simultaneously 
<br/>review all Job Descriptions and advertise vacancies accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  reviewed  that  the  Ministry’s  overall  performance  in  2014  and  2015  was 
<br/>satisfactory. It was noted that during those operational years, the Ministry met the challenges, which 
<br/>enabled the Ministry to promote and improve their service delivery.  The Committee noted that the 
<br/>dedication  of  all  the  staff  of  the  Ministry  in  both  the  years  2014  and  2015,  that  had  enabled  the 
<br/>Ministry to implement its programmes that were budgeted for and more importantly, in achieving its 
<br/>targets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  wishes  to  commend  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Lands  and  Mineral 
<br/>Resources and the Senior Officers of the Ministry, for their contribution towards the final compilation

<div><span>At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  all  the  honourable  Members  of  the 
<br/>Committee, namely; honourable Jale Sigarara, honourable Alexander O’Connor, honourable Mitieli 
<br/>Bulanauca and honourable Jese Saukuru for the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I also extend my appreciation to 
<br/>the Secretariat staff for their timely support in the compilation of this Report, and I commend the 
<br/>Report to Parliament.

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  The  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is  pleased  to  submit  to 
<br/>Parliament the Review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2017-2018 Annual Report.  
<br/>During  the  period  under  review,  the  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service  (FRCS)  collected  $2.83 
<br/>billion in net tax revenue, recording a growth of $252.8 million, which was about 9.8 percent over 
<br/>the previous fiscal year of 2016-2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FRCS has introduced the Standard Interpretation Guidelines (SIGs) during the 2017-2018 
<br/>period which is an extremely useful instrument that enables taxpayers to understand the technical 
<br/>interpretations made by FRCS.  These guidelines cover all complex issues which the taxpayers would 
<br/>be able to access and understand, especially regarding specific tax policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended FRCS for transitioning towards the use of digital  technology 
<br/></span><span>through the use of HR Information System, including the Online Performance Management System 
<br/>within the organisation.   The FRCS designed and consulted on the New Tax Information System 
<br/>(NTIS) Programme and the Taxpayer Online Services during the period under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(CEO) of the FRCS and his team members for making time to present before the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced this Report:  the Deputy Chairperson - honourable Veena Bhatnagar, honourable Sachida 
<br/>Nand, honourable Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.  I also take this opportunity 
<br/>to acknowledge and thank our Parliamentary staff, who have given their invaluable support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the review of the Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revenue and Customs Service 2017-2018 Annual Report to Parliament.

<div><span>Review Report – Compliance Audits Relating to COVID-19 Responses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Public  Accounts,  take  this  opportunity  to  speak  on  the  Review  Report  on  Compliance  Audits 
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Responses.  This Report follows the Report of the Auditor-General of the 
<br/></span><span>Republic of Fiji – Compliance Audits Relating to COVID-19 Responses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report summarises the audit issues raised by the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in relation to the following audits:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan; 
<br/>Procurement  of  Biomedical  Equipment  and  Quarantine  Accommodation  and  Stock 
<br/>Management for COVID-19; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Management of COVID-19 Aid; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Scheme; and 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Management of Agricultural Assistance-Farm Response Package, Home Gardening Seed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Packages and Improvement of Farm Genetic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Compliance Audit Relating to COVID-19 Response focusses on specific 
<br/>control  procedures  implemented  on  the  different  COVID-19  response  programmes.  The  above 
<br/>mentioned five Audit Reports were thoroughly scrutinised by the Committee, in consultation with 
<br/>the relevant Ministries and Departments.  Mr. Speaker Sir, I will address this in detail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to put this on record, that this was a very premature audit that 
<br/></span><span>was conducted by the  OAG.  The Committee fails to  understand that at the height  of COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic when agencies were trying to control a pandemic which the world has never seen, the OAG 
<br/>was busy in keeping Ministries engaged in the audit process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  one  side,  the  Ministry  of  Health  was  trying  to  control  the  pandemic,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy was assisting the people in need financially, the Ministry of Agriculture was distributing 
<br/>seedlings  for  food  security,  but  the  OAG  was  conducting  audit  and  looking  for  SOPs  within  the 
<br/>Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know and understand that we never had a pandemic like COVID-19 whereby borders 
<br/>were  closed.    The  country’s  economy  was  brought  down  to  its  knees.    People  were  waiting  for 
<br/>assistance to put food on the table.  However, the OAG was conducting audit within the Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister used to be in the Ministry of Health daily with his Cabinet 
<br/>making decisions there and then to assist people and the OAG was putting in recommendation that 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2193 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policies do not have Cabinet approval.  The Ministry of Economy received more than $400 million 
<br/>in aid during the pandemic and the OAG just conducted the audit on $23 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  was  assisting  SMEs  through  concessional  loans  through 
<br/>financial  institutions,  the  OAG  was  recommending  to  increase  the  bureaucratic  process  by 
<br/>duplicating what was already being done by financial institutions, Mr. Speaker.  Sir, for this reason 
<br/>the Committee believes that this was a premature audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the implementation of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan, Mr. Speaker Sir, audit 
<br/>on this was undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to form a conclusion on whether 
<br/>the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, through their Incident Management Team (IMT), had 
<br/>implemented response actions in accordance with Fiji’s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan 
<br/>for Level 1 (No potential or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Fiji) and Level 2 (Cases of imported 
<br/>potential or confirmed COVID-19 in Fiji without any local transmission).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services,  through  responsible  leads,  has  generally 
<br/>implemented appropriate response actions in  accordance with  Fiji’s COVID-19 Preparedness  and 
<br/>Response  Plan.    Implementation  of  the  response  action  has  enabled  the  state  of  preparedness  for 
<br/></span><span>addressing the occurrence of COVID-19 in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the identified findings of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, it has taken 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>into consideration the lessons learnt with improvements: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That in anticipation of Level 3, the Ministry will require financial resources to look at surges 
<br/>in cases.  Similar to the responses in the second wave of COVID-19, subsequent outbreaks 
<br/>will  require  both,  internal  and  external  support.  The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services has mechanisms to reach out for support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health and Medical Services’ IMT has developed a matrix for expenditure 
<br/>and the 10 key objectives or indicators that were listed.  This has now been implemented 
<br/>for financial management of the COVID-19 funds. The framework allows monitoring of 
<br/>expenditure  according  to  key  areas  and  assist  in  planning  and  forecast  for  expected 
<br/>spending. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve communications and flow of information for future events. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  further  planning  on  simulation  exercises  and  will  conduct  refresher 
<br/>trainings  and  build  on  communication  and  advocacy  to  maintain  a  high  degree  of 
<br/>awareness, skills and response to COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  procurement  of  Biomedical  Equipment,  Quarantine  Accommodation  and  Stock 
<br/>Management for COVID-19, Mr. Speaker Sir, the results of the audit had indicated that the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services has a number of policies and procedures that were still in the draft 
<br/>phase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit  review  of  the  procurement  of  biomedical  equipment  noted  that  all  processes  and 
<br/>procedures were followed in accordance with the Fiji Procurement Regulations 2010 and the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services Finance Manual. Overall, the IMT has done really well in terms of 
<br/>procurement  of  goods  and  services,  given  the  unprecedented  challenges  brought  about  by  the 
<br/>pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the management of COVID-19 Aid, the primary objective of the audit on this was to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to form a conclusion on whether processes and controls 
<br/>existed were effective to manage the COVID-19 Aid.  It was highlighted that the Management of 
<br/>COVID-19 Aid was generally being administered well with areas of improvement, such as:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Updating  of the SOPs  in  consultation  with other  key  stakeholders to capture  additional 
<br/>operational matters, which is handled by the Climate Change and International Cooperation 
<br/>Division at the Ministry of Economy through lessons learnt during the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Economy is in the process of developing a tool that will capture aid-in-
<br/>kind  at  the  whole  of  Government  level  as  a  strategy  to  increase  accountability  of 
<br/>Government Ministries, and to ensure duplicity of projects and resource allocations is 
<br/>well utilised across the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  (MSMECGS),  the 
<br/>COVID-19  pandemic  has  significantly  impacted  all  businesses,  especially  the  MSMEs.  The 
<br/>MSMECGS was established in 2012 with the aim of expanding lending to MSMEs and support the 
<br/>Government’s initiatives to promote MSMEs development, investment and local business activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government had allocated funding through its COVID-19 Response Budget for 
<br/>the  review  of  the  MSMECGS  to  encourage  private  sector  lending  to  MSMEs.    Government  had 
<br/>allocated an additional $5 million to assist MSMEs affected by the pandemic, raising the total amount 
<br/>allocated  to  $9  million.    Major  highlights  identified  that  the  MSME  Scheme  had  been  expanded 
<br/>during the COVID-19 pandemic to include micro enterprises and administered by the Reserve Bank 
<br/>of Fiji (RBF). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in April 2020, the Scheme was enhanced where the Government raised its 
<br/>guarantee  to  60  percent  of  the  principal  outstanding  on  defaulted  MSME  loans  up  to  a  limit  of 
<br/>$60,000 per business from 50 percent or $50,000 previously.  It is important to note what OAG has 
<br/>picked as an issue and made recommendations that are not practical as RBF will be duplicating the 
<br/>process of commercial banks and this will only increase bureaucracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial institutions giving out loans have their own set of guidelines and checklist that they 
<br/>go  through  before  approving  any  loan.    The  OAG  is  recommending  the  RBF  to  have  the  same 
<br/>checklist and processes basically duplicating the process.  However, the RBF has taken quick and 
<br/>decisive action to comply with standard procedures which include the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>RBF strengthening its procedures and added checklist that reflect the updated guidelines.  
<br/>RBF revising its reporting template effective from 1st June, 2020 and the annual turnover 
<br/>is now a requirement under the new MSMECGS reporting template in line with the revised 
<br/>definition  of  MSMEs.    The  banks  have  issued  a  new  reporting  template  for  financial 
<br/>institutions to submit turnover data for their respective registered MSME business loans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to No. 2, what the OAG failed to realise was if a company was given a loan in 
<br/>2012 or 2013, depending on their turnover back then, the turnover by year 2021 when the audit was 
<br/>conducted must have increased and now, what the Auditor-General is saying that an entity does not 
<br/>qualify for the concessional loan based on 2021 turnover, does not make sense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the management of Agricultural Assistance-Farm Response Package, Home Gardening 
<br/>Seed Packages and Improvement of Farm Genetic, the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the 
<br/>administration  and  delivery  of  the  COVID-19  agricultural  assistance  to  farmers  and  individuals 
<br/>meeting the eligibility criteria for home gardening, farm support and large commercial farming.  An

<div><span>allocation  of  $1million  was  allocated  to  the  Ministry  as  response  to  address  the  Food  Security 
<br/>Agricultural Growth and Expansion Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  the  identified  issues  by  the  Auditors,  the  Ministry  has  taken  stringent  measures  to 
<br/>ensure non-recurrence of issues by ensuring that supplies of farming materials will be based on an 
<br/>open transparent manner with consideration given to the most economical supplier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  overall,  I  thank  the  Executive  Management  of  those  Ministries  and 
<br/>Departments that appeared before the Committee to clarify the audit issues that were raised.  It is 
<br/>worth noting that this was not an easy time for Fiji, Fijians and the Fijian Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  personally  thank  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  the  Ministry  of  Health  and 
<br/>Medical  Services  and  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Ministry  of  Economy.    These  two  Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries were appointed at the height of COVID-19 and gave in 200 percent towards mitigating 
<br/>and  controlling  COVID-19  pandemic  and  at  the  same  time,  ensuring  that  the  country’s  economy 
<br/>continues to run, and assisting every affected Fijian in ensuring no one slept hungry at night.
