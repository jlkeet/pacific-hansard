<div><span>Review Report - Municipal Councils 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Audit Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.    Speaker  Sir,  this  Report  provides  the  Committee’s  review 
<br/>findings on the Report of the Auditor-General of the Republic of Fiji on the Municipal Councils for 
<br/>2018-2019 and the 2019-2020 Audit Reports.  The Office of the Auditor-General undertook an audit 
<br/>on the 11 Municipalities in the two Municipal Council Audit Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the beauty of any country is a direct reflection on how beautiful, clean and 
<br/>well maintained its towns and cities are.   Towns and cities are considered as the face of any country 
<br/>and  facelift  of  them  has  a  huge  and  positive  impact  on  the  tourism  sector.  Fiji  being  a  tourist 
<br/>destination, we need to have very attractive and stunning towns and cities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning to the Audit Report, it is important to note that few councils are covered in both audit 
<br/>reports and majority of these municipalities are in backlog. This is mainly due to the fact that newly 
<br/>appointed CEO’s and their finance team are more focused on past years audit reports and financial 
<br/>statements and are not  able to  focus  on the current  year’s thus  the current  years audit report gets 
<br/>delayed as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the delay in the audits is also due to the non-submission of draft financial 
<br/>statements to the Auditor-General for audit, as legislated by 31</span><span>st</span><span> May annually. There are various 
<br/>reasons fully understood by Public Accounts Committee, such as records not available, staff have 
<br/>moved on to other organisations and municipal councils still using the ancient way of record keeping 
<br/>in file.  Now such situations are putting immense pressure on the current management to be dealing 
<br/>with audit queries and getting their annual and audit reports up to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be more realistic for the Public Accounts Committee to be dealing with current issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rather than investing efforts in scrutinizing old audit reports. In this way, the municipalities’ senior 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>management and Special Administrators can be held accountable by the Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>during their term in office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With all efforts made by the Council, the Office of the Auditor-General and Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee, it is great to see that smaller Municipal Councils such as the Savusavu Town Council 
<br/>had  submitted  their  accounts  for  audit  with  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  for  financial  year 
<br/>ending 2021.  This  Council is  led by a  young woman with  a very dynamic team  who has turned 
<br/>Savusavu  Town  Council  from  a  non-profitable  organisation  to  a  profitable  one.  It  is  good  to  see 
<br/>women setting example for other municipalities to follow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2018-2019 Audit Report on Municipal Councils, the Office of the Auditor-General had 
<br/>issued modified audit opinions on six financial statements that were audited while eight  financial 
<br/>statements  were  issued  with  disclaimers  of  opinion.    However,  the  2019-  2020  Audit  Report  on 
<br/>Municipal Councils, the Office of the Auditor-General had issued one modified audit opinion and 
<br/>five disclaimers of opinion on the financial statements of six Municipal Councils that were audited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee notes that there are general audit issues in the 11 Municipal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Councils that are as follows – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Substantial variances in cash have been found in all Municipal Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Record  keeping  is  very  inadequate  which  results  in  discrepancies  in  financial 
<br/>statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Credibility of the contractors and engineers are not checked before projects are handed 
<br/>over to them. This result in delays in projects and in some instances major defects have 
<br/>also been identified. The Public Accounts Committee highly recommends that the CIU 
<br/>Unit of the Ministry of Economy and the Fiji Tender Board be consulted in future for 
<br/>guidance during capital projects.  The Ministry of Local Government also needs to work 
<br/>closely  with  the  Fiji  Tender  Board  to  develop  appropriate  policies,  guidelines  and 
<br/>procedures that must be followed by councils for tender processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>More  qualified,  experienced  and  reliable  personnel  are  to  be  employed  to  ensure 
<br/>accounts and statements are prepared in accordance to accounting rules and procedures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Uniform software to be used by all municipalities which is compatible to the software 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that are developed under the Fiji Digital Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Municipalities that do not have strategic plans must work towards developing one for 
<br/>the near future. It is very important to have those in line with the 5 Year and 20 Year 
<br/>National Development Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of the above audit findings, the Committee noted that majority of the issues identified 
<br/>herewith  have  been  taken  into  consideration  with  necessary  implementation  undertaken  by 
<br/>municipalities and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Municipalities are liaising with Ministry of Local Government to provide staff training in 
<br/>areas of bookkeeping, application of accounting software, receipting, rates recording and 
<br/>reconciliations so that variances in financial statements can be minimised; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A very  thorough interview process is  being  conducted to  select the  best  candidate who 
<br/>specialises  and  have  knowledge  in  bookkeeping,  application  of  accounting  software, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2045 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>receipting, rates recording and reconciliation as this will ensure efficiency and accuracy in 
<br/>accounts and reports.  It is, therefore, desirable to adopt the Open Merit Recruitment and 
<br/>Selection (OMRS) system to ensure transparency and accountability; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) are being developed and will be readily available 
<br/>as it provides policies, processes and standards needed for the organization to succeed. It 
<br/>can benefit the municipalities in reducing errors, increasing efficiencies and profitability, 
<br/>creating a safer work environment thus producing guidelines for how to resolve issues and 
<br/>overcome obstacles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker Sir, Suva City Council has been rated as one of the efficient municipalities.  For 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>instance, it is always seen that the Council –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is investing in parks, buildings and are more focused in generating revenues through rental 
<br/>as the Council had engaged in a lot of investment and not just relying on rate collection as 
<br/>revenue; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tree planting initiative that is being undertaken is climate and environment friendly; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supported Lami Town Council through capacity building which led to a favorable financial 
<br/>performance. The Council continues to provide a place for micro business which is striving 
<br/>within the city and creates a bustling centre; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ability  to  maintain  cleanliness  through  effective  solid  waste  management  system  and 
<br/>sanitation control is welcoming which has seen the Council now managing solid waste for 
<br/>Nasinu Town Council as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  the  work  done  by  the  Council  is  commended  and  other  municipalities  that  are  not 
<br/>performing up to par should use the performing council as a benchmark.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee has seen that the Municipal Councils are adopting the OMRS and it can be 
<br/>seen in terms of improved service delivery.  If councils are run like a corporate organisation and the 
<br/>right people are selected for the right job, the Committee believes that the Municipal Council can 
<br/>obtain substantial growth as there is a huge potential for growth for these councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the work that is currently being carried out by the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/></span><span>with  this  Council.    It  was  evident  that  after  a  few  rounds  of  consultations  with  the  Committee 
<br/></span><span>improvements can be seen with these Councils at the Ministry level.  While the Committee realizes 
<br/>the Government’s vision to give full autonomy to Councils and its Board on the day to day operations 
<br/>of the Council, the Ministry needs to continue to provide an oversight and monitor the function of 
<br/>the Council at least until such time the Council starts to operate independently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee will continue to encourage these Councils to update their audited accounts 
<br/>and to put forward strategic measures to address the pertinent issues that continue to appear in the 
<br/>audits.  Overall, I thank the executives of these municipalities and the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/></span><span>for providing their written response to the audit issues and also for appearing before the Committee 
<br/></span><span>to clarify issues that were raised by the Members. Also acknowledge the steps taken and measures 
<br/>put in place by the Department of Local Government with the Councils to resolve anomalies and 
<br/>variances  that  were  highlighted,  and  the  staff  of  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  for  providing 
<br/>technical clarifications on those audit issues.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.

<div><span>Review Report – Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 
<br/>to  submit  to  Parliament  the  Review  Report  of  Accident  Compensation  Commission  Fiji  (ACCF) 
<br/>2018 Annual Report. The no-fault compensation scheme was introduced by the Fijian Government 
<br/>through the Accident Compensation Act 2017 to address the various challenges and delays that were 
<br/>formerly faced by individuals who were involved in motor vehicle accidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended the Accident  Compensation Commission Fiji for the services 
<br/>they provided, in particular the no-fault basis of the compensation paid to families of accident victims 
<br/>for the period under review. During the submission, the Chief Executive Officer stated that the benefit 
<br/>of the no-fault scheme was realised in the very first few payments of compensation.  Some of the 
<br/>cases brought forward were such that the applicants would not have been entitled to compensation 
<br/></span><span>given the requirement of proving fault under the previous law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware that ACCF had collaborated with key organisations such as 
<br/>Ministry of Health, Ministry of Employment, Ministry of Education, Land Transport Authority, Fiji 
<br/>Police Force and Legal Aid Commission to deliver their services efficiently and commended such 
<br/>collaborations.  Furthermore, it was noted during the submission that majority of the motor vehicle 
<br/>accidents were due to careless and dangerous driving. It is urged that all drivers use caution and be 
<br/>mindful of the various risks careless drivers pose not only to themselves but to other road users.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the CEO of ACCF and his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>team members for taking time to present before the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced this report: honourable Veena Bhatnagar (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Sachida Nand, 
<br/>honourable  Inosi  Kuridrani  and  honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau.  I  also  take  this  opportunity  to 
<br/>acknowledge and thank the Parliamentary staff who have given us invaluable support.  On behalf of

<div><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister and Department of Immigration 
<br/>Annual Report 2018 – 2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a way of a brief background, the Office of the 
<br/>Prime Minister and the Department of Immigration Annual Report 2018-2019 was referred to the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to be reviewed and the results of this, is to 
<br/>be reported back to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Prime Minister is primarily responsible for providing sound 
<br/>policy  advice  and  support  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet.  The  Department  of 
<br/>Immigration  is  mandated  in  providing  efficient  and  effective  immigration  service  through  the 
<br/>administration  and  enforcement  of  immigration  related  laws  and  international  conventions.  The 
<br/>Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Department  of  Immigration  engages  with  international  and 
<br/>regional development partners, Civil Society Organisations and the private sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  reviewing  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Department  of 
<br/>Immigration  Annual  Report,  the  Committee  noted  that  a  few  of  the  key  achievements  were  the 
<br/>facilitation of the COP 23 and supporting the honourable Prime Minister presiding as Chairman until 
<br/>December 2018. The Department of Immigration successfully embarked on the e-Passport Project in 
<br/>September 2018 to allow for a smooth transition to e-Passport use in future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now go into detail on some of the key highlights and issues that were 
<br/>identified from the review.  Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was identified that the Vatukoula Gold Mine 
<br/>Strike  dispute  has  been  a  longstanding  issue,  over  three  decades  old,  but  there  were  numerous 
<br/>attempts along the way to resolve the issue. A legal opinion on the cause of the issue had been sought 
<br/>from the Office of the Solicitor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  noted  that  the  Gold  Mine  Company  did  not  breach  the  contract 
<br/>agreement between them and the individuals that had been affected. The Government then stepped 
<br/>in to try to bring about an amicable solution and there is even an offer of an ex gratia payment to the 
<br/>affected  person.  These  sort  of  payments  are  considered  as  rewards  given  and  are  not  necessarily 
<br/>something that one is obliged to pay, but does so as a way of  recognition and appreciation of the 
<br/>work done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were individuals who felt that this was not enough and thus 
<br/>wanted the payment to be compensation for the 30 years of dispute and wanted a substantial amount 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of money for this, $2 million per person to be exact. This motion by these individuals is contrary to 
<br/>the legal opinion and it should be kept in mind that the Government and the Gold Mining Company 
<br/>had no obligation to offer compensation thus this issue remains unresolved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the $9 million budget allocation to the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister for the Small Grant Scheme Programme, $5.2 million was utilised with a total of 70 projects 
<br/>funded  during  the  financial  year  in  the  education  sector,  village  settlements  and  other  integrated 
<br/>sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  Donor  Aided  Projects,  only  one  project  was  undertaken  and  completed  while  10 
<br/>projects  are  still  on  feasibility  study.  The  completed  project  was  the  renovation  of  a  newly  State 
<br/>House Squash Court with a cost of FJ$2 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  noted  that  the  Rotuma  Subvention  Fund  was  not 
<br/>utilised, funds were not released due to the non-submission of audited accounts of the Council of 
<br/>Rotuma. It was advised that these submissions are necessary in having transparent and accountable 
<br/>financial  records  and  it  was  impressed  upon  the  Council  of  Rotuma  that  following  the  relevant 
<br/>process will be the key to the release of funds from the Rotuma Subvention Fund. This has been the 
<br/>case when the release of funds recommenced in the 2021-2022 Financial Year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Immigration  Department  undertook  a  joint  venture  programme 
<br/>agreement  with  the  Muehlbauer  High  Tech  International  for  the  introduction  of  the  e-Passport 
<br/>system. The total cost of this investment is approximately $7.8 million to $8 million. This covered 
<br/>the cost of hardware, software, installation, et cetera. The e-Passport System is enclosed by a secured 
<br/>firewall and uses access control as part of its security measures. This, together with the Department’s 
<br/>security  regulations  and  SOPs  safeguards  the  Integrated  e-Passport  Issuance  System.  The  Fiji 
<br/>Immigration Department has also reviewed and developed numerous SOPs to boost efficiency of the 
<br/>services it provides such as faster turnaround time for application outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  also  noted  that  there  were  weak  internal  controls,  which  led  to 
<br/>irregularities in financial reporting of Immigration Department, thus it was commendable to know 
<br/>that the Department  had put  in  place measures  to  address  these irregularities, which are aimed at 
<br/>improving the revenue process and financial reporting for the Department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, the Committee also undertook SDG scrutiny of the Annual Report 
<br/>and noted that there were certain activities supported by the Office of the Prime Minister and Fijian 
<br/>Immigration  Department,  which  could  be  linked  to  the  efforts  towards  achieving  the  National 
<br/></span><span>Development Plan and ultimately, the global agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Prime Minister’s Development Co-operation and Facilitation Division is 
<br/>responsible  for  the  Small  Grants  Scheme  which  is  also  provided  to  rural  and  outer  island 
<br/>communities.  It  is  worth  noting  that  this  Scheme  is  aimed  at  addressing  the  needs  of  these 
<br/>communities in terms of village/settlement improvements, education and climate-resilient projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the Committee is  guided by  Fiji  Parliamentary  Standing Order 
<br/>110(2) in regards to the scrutinisation of Parliamentary papers with consideration on the impact and 
<br/>benefit to both, men and women. It was noted that the Office of the Prime Minister’s efforts towards 
<br/>gender equality was focused on its human resource, which is one of the vital parts of any institution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Prime Minister and the Fijian Immigration Department utilised the Open 
<br/>Merit Recruitment System for hiring and recruiting staff.  It was also noted that both Offices have 
<br/>given  much  effort  in  empowering  its  female  staff  by  encouraging  attendance  in  trainings  and 
<br/>development programmes. In the reported year for the Office of the Prime Minister, 37 percent male 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Development Bank (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2049 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  62.8  percent  female  were  provided  and  supported  with  capacity  building  and  development   
<br/>programmes.    For  the  Fijian  Immigration  Department,  the  gender  mainstream  ratio  stood  at  53 
<br/>percent female to 47 percent male, whereby 68 trainings were conducted through overseas and local 
<br/>courses, and a total of 131 officers attended. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  the  commendable  effort  done  by  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Fijian 
<br/>Immigration Department, the Committee feels that more support should be focused in strengthening 
<br/>the respective Units in terms of delivery by both Offices. The Committee also believes that for the 
<br/>purpose of continued improvements, it would be prudent to put forth  a few recommendations for 
<br/>consideration to the Office of the Prime Minister and the Fijian Immigration Department.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in regards to the Vatukoula Gold Mine issue, it was noted that this has been a 
<br/>long-standing  issue, and the efforts put  in  by all  parties involved is  duly  recognised.  But  for the 
<br/>purpose of resolving this issue, it is recommended that discussions be reinitiated as soon as possible 
<br/>whereby a settlement is reached that is agreed upon by all parties involved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the second recommendation, Mr. Speaker, in regards to the non-utilisation of the Rotuma 
<br/>Subvention  Fund,  the  Committee  supports  the  stance  by  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/></span><span>recommends that adherence to necessary processes in place for the submission of financial reports 
<br/></span><span>for audit should be maintained and monitoring of this should be upheld so as not to affect the release 
<br/>of funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, at this juncture, I wish to acknowledge the honourable Members of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights – honourable Rohit Sharma (Deputy Chairperson), 
<br/>honourable  Dr.  Salik  Govind,  honourable  Mosese  Bulitavu  and  honourable  Mikaele  Leawere  for 
<br/>their deliberation and input; the Secretariat and the representatives of the Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/>and  Fijian  Department  of  Immigration  for  their  cooperation,  which  assisted  the  Committee  in  its 
<br/>work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, on behalf of the Committee, commend the Committee’s Report on the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister and Department of Immigration Annual Report 2018-2019 to Parliament and seek support 
<br/>of all its members to take note of the recommendations by the Committee.
