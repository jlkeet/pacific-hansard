<div><span>Absorption/Recruitment of Ba Mission Hospital Staff by Aspen 
<br/>(Question No. 138/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communication, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament if all staff at the 
<br/>Ba Mission Hospital will be automatically recruited or absorbed as employees in the new Ba 
<br/>Hospital managed by Aspen?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer is no, they will not be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a follow-up question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister; will there be an opportunity given to the staff who are not absorbed into the new hospital 
<br/>to perhaps move sideways within the Ministry in the Ba area? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, we have on a number of occasions on the floor of this 
<br/>Chamber answered this question.  We have said from the beginning that this PPP is not only about 
<br/>Ba Hospital.  The PPP is about Lautoka Hospital and also about Ba Hospital and we have said that 
<br/>the people  who worked  in  these two hospitals have a choice.    They  can choose to  stay  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services or they can join Aspen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are currently 917 staff including doctors in the two facilities.  There 
<br/>is 122 in Ba Mission Hospital and 795 in Lautoka Hospital and out of these, 84 percent of the health

<div><span>Expansion of Commercial Crop Agriculture – Strategies &amp; Plans 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 139/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the strategies and plans to expand commercial crop agriculture?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for asking that 
<br/>important question - important for the country, the economy, all the stakeholders, the farmers, the 
<br/>household, labourers and the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture’s direction is guided by the 2019-2023 Strategic Development 
<br/>Plan, aligned to the 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan, with the overall objective of 
<br/>achieving  the  SDGs  through  a  sustainable,  competitive  and  resilient  agriculture  sector  over  this 
<br/></span><span>period.    The  Ministry’s  Strategic  Development  Plan  is  grounded  on  five  key  strategic  priorities, 
<br/></span><span>which includes commercial agriculture  expansion;  the availability of financial services;  increased 
<br/>agri-business participation and enhancing the ICT system into the agricultural sector  - all towards 
<br/>improving and expanding commercial agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the agriculture sector continues to reflect growth over the last decade.  From 
<br/>2018 to 2020, the value of non-sugar cane agriculture GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate 
<br/>(CAGR) of 4.9 percent.   This was an increase from FJ$686 million in 2018 to FJ$756 million in 
<br/>2020.  The growth was influenced by commodities like kava, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, ginger, turmeric and horticultural 
<br/>crops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The return on investment in the last three financial years with an average budgetary allocation 
<br/>of  $62.9million  where  every  dollar  of  Government  investment  in  agriculture,  meaning  the 
<br/>Government’s  agriculture  budgetary  allocation,  resulted  in  $9  an  output.    That  is  the  return  on 
<br/>investment.  So whenever we, the Ministry, talk about our allocation, we treat that as an investment 
<br/>rather than expenditure.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, comparatively, this return on investment is from the higher 
<br/>side comparatively to other developing countries - 1:9.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to further continuing to leverage the agriculture 
<br/></span><span>sector  noting  the  strategic  advantage  we  have  regarding  crop  agriculture,  noting  the  favourable 
<br/>weather conditions we have, and noting the vast amount of unutilised lands which has the potential 
<br/>to be brought under agriculture.  At the end of 2021-2022 Financial Year, the Ministry recorded an 
<br/>additional 15,598 farmers in the database, which makes up the total number of farmers, adding onto 
<br/>the Census one, to 98,996.  At the moment, we have in our books 98,993 farmers.  So, a substantial 
<br/>increase from the Census period, which was 2020, which was 83,000, so from 2020 to this year, now 
<br/>we have got an additional 15,000 farmers moving to agriculture.  It is a very positive sign noting that 
<br/>farmers and labourers in the urban areas have confidence in the agriculture sector to peg their future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to note this and to deliver onto our objective of expanding commercial crop 
<br/>agriculture, this year in this budget (unfortunately, our critics are not able to read the budget), $29.2 
<br/>million  has  been  allocated  to  fast  track  the  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  provide  direct 
<br/>assistance.  So this $29.2million is the direct assistance that we will provide to farmers, apart from 
<br/>the technical advice to our pathologies and entomologies that we are giving to farmers, apart from 
<br/>the subsidised medicines that we are providing to livestock farmers and apart from the other support 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we are providing through our Ministry, for example, support towards eradicating brucellosis and 
<br/>tuberculosis.  So on top of all those, $29.2million has been allocated and advertised, Sir, so that every 
<br/>farmer  out  there  who  is  interested  to  get  a  leverage  through  Government  support  will  have  an 
<br/>opportunity to apply and compete on equal footing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this $29.2 million, top is $7 million that has been allocated for the first 
<br/>time ever for farmers to hire machinery to bring new land under cultivation to cultivate existing land 
<br/>through land preparation, drainage works, using a bulldozer to better organise their farms or bring 
<br/>new land under cultivation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got allocation to allow farmers to buy small machinery on a one-
<br/>third, two-thirds basis.  For example, they want to buy a rotavator, they want to buy a mini tractor, 
<br/>they want to buy a disc plough, et cetera.  So, the Ministry will contribute a grant of up to $5,000.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, noting that our highest export earner is kava, we are now wanting to give these 
<br/>farmers a number of them, with the allocation of $72,000 small gadgets, pounding machines, dryer 
<br/>et cetera.  We have got assistance for rice farmers.  The rice season last year up till two months ago, 
<br/>we had a bumper harvest in Vanua Levu; ten times more production than last year and we incentivised 
<br/>them through the provision of harvesters from the Ministry.  Now we want them to own the harvesters 
<br/></span><span>where we will provide two-thirds contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime  Minister, about  a month ago, handed over two harvesters to  two co-
<br/>operatives in Vanua Levu.  This year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got 10 harvesters, so that completely 
<br/>in Vanua Levu, the farmer cooperatives will own harvesters.  This is a critical binding constraint in 
<br/>a rice farming community because they do not have people to harvest rice manually and the amount 
<br/>of confidence this has built when we announced that we will now be giving all those groups in Vanua 
<br/>Levu who are growing rice in groups, harvesters they have now started to bring in more land.  Land 
<br/>is also being shifted from other crops as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also provided, assisting in this package of $29.2 million, farmers 
<br/>whose farming land is  far away  from  where they  are staying.   This  is  typical  in  Fiji,  in  the rural 
<br/>interior where we have got farmers living in villages but their farm is about two kilometres to three 
<br/>kilometres away.  When they go to work on their farm, they do not return the same day, they return 
<br/>three days later, four days later et cetera, so they need a small farm house or farm shed.  For that, the 
<br/>Ministry has got a package of material and we are looking at assisting close to 42 farmers to construct 
<br/>farm sheds on their farms with an allocation of $170,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are assisting farmers to make major investments through a grant where 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry will provide 20 percent equity contribution as a grant to the loan that they will take from 
<br/>FDB.  It is a new programme that we started last year, first-time ever, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is called 
<br/>“Commercial  Farmers  Equity  Package”.    Farmers  who  would  want  to  construct  or  do  major 
<br/>investment, buy an excavator, bulldozer of their own, individually, Mr. Speaker, they can dip into 
<br/>and apply for this assistance.  All these are open now, closing on Wednesday and we are extending 
<br/>it till next week Friday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  got  another  allocation  to  assist  the  new  young  graduates  out  of 
<br/>Navuso  Agriculture  Technical  Institute  (NATI),  out  of  FNU,  who  want  to  undertake  commercial 
<br/>agriculture to assist them in preparing five acres of their land at one-tenth of the cost.  We will pick 
<br/>up 90 percent of the cost of the land preparation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also wanting farmers to own their own tractors in groups.  This year 
<br/>with  a  budget  of  $1.16  million  of  which  25  tractors  will  be  provided  to  farmer  groups  and  five 
<br/>excavators will be provided to these farmers in Lomaivuna cluster where 90 percent of Fiji’s ginger

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2101</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>originates from.  The honourable Minister for Economy was there and they raised this issue about 
<br/>delay in getting a Government digger and we are quite fortunate to have this allocation that they will 
<br/>now own this excavator to undertake, as you know, for ginger cultivation.  They need to bring in new 
<br/>land every year because the existing land where they grew ginger cannot be utilised for the next three 
<br/>years because of the nematode issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are simultaneously through the supply-chain sending signals to these 
<br/>farmers  by  organising  the  market  for  them  and  therefore  leveraging  the  agro  process  with  the 
<br/>exporters by  having  a  separate allocation  where they  can do  capital  improvements on the side, 
<br/>where they will be able to access a grant of up to $10,000 to upgrade their capital equipment. We 
<br/>are looking at supporting 15 agro-processors from this allocation through the $10,000 grant while 
<br/>the agro-processors can also apply for the commercial farmers’ equity where they can take a bigger 
<br/>loan package from the Fiji Development Bank while we will provide 20 percent equity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our women in the agriculture programme have a $300,000 allocation, the 
<br/>largest allocation ever for women who are engaged in agriculture and they can apply for assistance 
<br/>of whatever they need. We have also got other support through planting material totally free to 
<br/>farmers whether it is </span><span>dalo</span><span> planting material, </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, cassava or horticultural crop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this way we will see a bumper increase in production, at the same time 
<br/>we are working very closely with the Ministry of Industry and Trade to open up new markets not 
<br/>only in Australia and New Zealand but also totally new markets in the United States of America 
<br/>and other countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.  I  just  heard  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture mention that they are planning to reintroduce this assistance 
<br/>to new graduates from agricultural schools. Can the honourable Minister enlighten Parliament, this 
<br/>programme started in 2018, how many of those assisted are still planting today? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- It is related.  How many are still in the programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A supplementary question must be related to the original question, that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why I gave you the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Illicit Drugs Trade – Non-Involvement of Police Officers 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 140/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.</span><span> </span><span>NAVURELEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management inform Parliament as to what measures 
<br/>are in place to ensure that Police Officers are not involved in illicit drugs trade, given the 
<br/>recent suspensions of Police Officers facing drugs-related charges?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for the question. Let me clearly state from the very outset that this is a serious issue and is 
<br/>of concern and the Fiji Police Force does not take this lightly and ensures that those involved are 
<br/>dealt with appropriately within the laws that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the war on drugs in Fiji has been ongoing since the 1980s.  Drugs are now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>2102 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>available and more readily accessible than ever before. The Fiji Police Force has been conducting 
<br/>Drug  Operations  consistently  around  the  country  and  these  operations  may  have  the  tendency  to 
<br/>expose and lure police personnel to get involved in illegal drugs trade given the lucrative value of 
<br/>these drugs.  This is something that has happened across the world and in major drugs and narcotics 
<br/>markets such as North America and, of course, the Australasian region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recent  suspension  of  Police  Officers  facing  drug-related  charges  is 
<br/>testament to the fact that the Fiji Police Force does not take the war on drugs lightly whether it be 
<br/>nipping it in the bud in the communities or be it within the organisation.  I, again, wish to make this 
<br/>clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that anyone, uniformed Police Officer or not, that is involved in illicit drugs 
<br/>trade commits a criminal offence under the Illicit Drugs Control Act of 2004 and, therefore, will be 
<br/>fully investigated and brought  before the judicial system for appropriate  actions. There is  no two 
<br/>ways about this and I have been consistently briefed by the Commissioner of Police on this issue and 
<br/>I fully support the corrective actions and measures that the Fiji Police Force has instituted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force has a Drug Testing Policy and Procedure 
<br/>in place.  This outlines the responsibilities of any member of the Force at recruitment level and during 
<br/>his or her term of employment to uphold the organisational Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct in 
<br/></span><span>daily duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, any employee may be requested with informed consent to undergo a random 
<br/>drug test if there is suspicion of drug use or administration. As enforcers of law and order, members 
<br/>of the Fiji Police Force are held to a higher standard and rightfully so anyone found to be involved 
<br/>in  any  illegal  drug  transaction  or  may  have  tested  positive  during  drug  test  will  undergo  internal 
<br/>disciplinary proceedings as well as criminal prosecution.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, again the Fiji Police Force 
<br/>has a zero tolerance policy in this regard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  also  mention  that  for  Supervisors,  Officer  In  Charge  (OCs)  and 
<br/>Managers, they have a duty of care and due diligence in ensuring that they familiarise themselves 
<br/>with the nature of work that they are assigned, together with the backgrounds of their subordinates 
<br/>and their family background in order to address any possible issues their staff may encounter at work 
<br/>or at the home front that could allow opportunities for employees to involve themselves in such illicit 
<br/>activities.  The superiors are given this responsibility to monitor and know their subordinates very 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if someone is on a drinking pattern or may be doing a purchase of a property; 
<br/></span><span>these are the things that they monitor closely so that they can give them some indication that their 
<br/></span><span>officers are getting money from other sources other than their pay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, the Internal Affairs Unit conducts awareness on a regular basis within the Forces 
<br/>on  such  matters.      Lastly  as  a  disciplinary  force,  an  organisation  that  embraces  values,  this  is 
<br/>becoming very important now and with the recruits, this is something that is always of importance in 
<br/>the lectures to live within the values of the institution and of course set high examples as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will be happy to answer any further questions, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T. NAVURELEVU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Is the Drug 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Squad still in existence within the Force? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, the Drug Squad is still there.  We 
<br/>have seen some models, we are looking at the Singaporean model where, hopefully by 2027 we will 
<br/>(again subject to Cabinet endorsement and of course funding as well) have an independent Narcotics 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2103</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drugs Bill. That is the plan, but of course, yes, we still maintain the Drug Squad within the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force for now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving towards that direction as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to have all the enablers and 
<br/>the key capabilities in place.  One is the laboratory that the Fiji Police Force now has in Nasese where 
<br/>previously all the drugs used to be tested in Koronivia.  Now the police are doing their own testing 
<br/>so this is something that together with Forensic Unit we will look into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for his detailed explanation.  He has been talking about the monitoring of the Intelligence 
<br/>Unit, that is, monitoring the offenders or maybe the Police Officers who doing the drug haul. Is there 
<br/>anyone monitoring the people who are monitoring, accounting intelligence?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think the Minister has already answered that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress of School Rehabilitation – Northern Division 
<br/>(Question No. 141/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/>update Parliament on the progress of school rehabilitation in the North which is being funded 
<br/>by the Australian Government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>We all know that </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>caused substantial damage to schools in the North and actually around the 
<br/>country.    As  an  immediate  measure,  the  Ministry  partnered  with  the  Australian  Department  of 
<br/>Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and fixed 29 schools as quick fixes to allow schools to resume. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry and DFAT spent approximately $600,000 to purchase materials for the quick 
<br/>fixes.    These  schools  were  repaired  by  the  school  management  team,  community  members  and 
<br/>Republic of Fiji Military Forces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some schools were badly damaged and needed to be rehabilitated. As a long 
<br/>standing partner in education, the Australian Government committed AU$12.5 million to rehabilitate 
<br/>nine schools in the North. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nine schools are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lekutu Secondary School; 
<br/>Lekutu District School; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Maramarua District School; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Dreketi Primary School; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Bua District School; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Dama District School; 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Ratu Luke Memorial Primary School; 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Wailevu West District School; and  
<br/>9.</span><span> </span><span>Nukubolu Primary School. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first six months of programme implementation, a suite of new designs 
<br/>for  classrooms,  teachers  quarters,  ablution  blocks  and  dormitories  were  developed.  This  design 
<br/>represent  international  best  practice.    The  Category  5  cyclone  certified  low  technology,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>environmentally sustainable and have a high focus on accessibility for students with disabilities and 
<br/>safety for girls.  School classroom blocks have been designed with maximum flexibility with natural 
<br/>light cross ventilation including partition walls that allow for use as evacuation centres.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, leading up to the design of the buildings, a  number of discussions were 
<br/>held  with  the  Head  of  School,  School  Management  Committee  members  and  community  to 
<br/>understand  any  sensitivities  in  the  communities  and  to  ensure  that  the  design  is  accepted  by  the 
<br/>community and it serves their purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the underlying philosophy that will be applied is to ensure that communities 
<br/>are involved in the rehabilitation work so that they can also provide labour support and earned from 
<br/>this project where possible.  We see this project as a partnership between the Ministry, the Australian 
<br/>Government and the affected communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The construction works packages are now out of tender and it is anticipated that construction 
<br/>will commence in all nine schools by the end of this year.  To enable effective, timely and highly 
<br/>quality delivery, the Australian Government agreed to manage the implementation of this project.  A 
<br/>programme  still  in  Committee  comprising  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  Economy  and  Permanent 
<br/></span><span>Secretary for Education plus the Development Counsellor from the Australian High Commission, 
<br/></span><span>they meet regularly to provide oversight and direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Learning and teaching at these schools are going on smoothly with the initial repairs done to 
<br/>ensure there is no disruption to teaching and learning.  With the new infrastructure the communities 
<br/>will  have  better  cyclone  resistant  infrastructure.    I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Australian 
<br/>Government for this timely assistance.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Recovery of the Tourism Industry - Tourism Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 142/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport update 
<br/>Parliament on the activities of Tourism Fiji, given the progress in the recovery of the Tourism 
<br/>industry?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  We 
<br/></span><span>have already recovered over half which is about 56.4 percent of visitors Fiji received in 2019.  Our 
<br/></span><span>national  airline  Fiji  Airways  is  currently  holding  approximately  8  percent  higher  bookings  from 
<br/>August and  going forward about 12 months, 35 properties in July showed that there are actually 
<br/>operating at an average of about 85 percent occupancy. The average daily rate in July was 23 percent 
<br/>more than July 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  I previously mentioned in  Parliament, we  are  actually  going to  make 
<br/>every marketing dollar count when this financial year Tourism Fiji like many other organizations 
<br/>who focus on season’s new opportunities and there is a change in paradigm in the tourism industry 
<br/>and we need to hold heartedly and welcome this transformation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to our branding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tourism Fiji has a number of key activities 
<br/>that  are  planned  for  Fiji  and  our  global  markets  and  this  starts  with  the  brand  evolution  that  re-
<br/>energizes the iconic “Fiji – Where happiness finds you”.  The “Fiji - Where happiness finds you” 
<br/>brand has represented us for over a decade and it has done so wonderfully in terms of growth and 
<br/>visit numbers also. But a lot has changed which means we need to be future looking, we are actually

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2105</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>working with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and other relevant stakeholders to bring out more of 
<br/>what it is about Fiji that truly inspires people to visit.  We will be essentially connecting people with 
<br/>Fijians  more  than  we  have  did  it  before,  Sir,  without  giving  too  much  away,  we  can  expect  the 
<br/>campaign to roll out on 10</span><span>th</span><span> October, and I can tell you that we are very excited about this rebrand as 
<br/>it is sure to elevate Fiji’s presence and help us stand out amongst our competitors.  I cannot let the 
<br/>little bit go, I know we are happy to find the branding actually very popular amongst all Fijians, we 
<br/>will not want to be losing that, we just rejigging it, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  respect  to  its  corporate  plan,  in  May  this  year,  Tourism  Fiji  launched  its  2022-2024 
<br/>Corporate Plan, a two year road map, sets out the clear path to drive our tourism recovery forward, 
<br/>and what is unique here is that, that actually looks beyond marketing and looks at the strategies to 
<br/>create meaningful jobs, stronger value chains, environmental stewardship in connecting visitors to 
<br/>more of our culture and delivers value to the custodians of the land and Fijians.  With respect to new 
<br/>routes, we are also looking at new markets soon, as we all know Fiji Airways will start the direct 
<br/>flight  to  Vancouver  and  this  is  an  opportunity  for  Tourism  Fiji  to  increase  feasibility  in  North 
<br/>America.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tourism industry has a huge Fijian diaspora in our national airline and we all see this as 
<br/></span><span>good news and rightfully so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we are more connected with the world.  I 
<br/></span><span>know honourable Gavoka has mentioned something along the lines of the economics of operating 
<br/>flights to Canada should drive Fiji, not its politics, I really do not know where that came from.  May 
<br/>be, he should say that to every Fijian who are returning home and they are coming back in absolute 
<br/>draw and every tourist to get into Fiji a lot easier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the more we connect, the more we benefit.  Fiji Airways is flying directly 
<br/>also to Adelaide, has already shown as promising results when we received the highest number of 
<br/>Australians in July than in any given month in Fijian history.  In terms of our niche products, through 
<br/>Tourism Fiji, we are also supporting our creative arts sector in building greater synergy with tourism.  
<br/>We are looking at promoting some of our Fijian talents as well as our local designers, et cetera.  We 
<br/>know  our  capabilities  in  hosting  top  tier  events  including  sports  tourism  and  also  the  Meetings, 
<br/>Incentives, Conferences &amp; Exhibitions (MICE) markets.  With borders now open, we will continue 
<br/>to pose such events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to our website, Tourism Fiji’s website has actually generated about 4 million 
<br/>page views with 1.5 million new users added.  So over 1.7 million operated listings were actually 
<br/>viewed and 150,000 leads were sent from the site of tourism operators with the average time spent 
<br/></span><span>on the site of impressive two minutes.  With respect to regional activities also, besides increasing our 
<br/></span><span>digital footprint, Tourism Fiji is actually participating in in-country events with most recent being 
<br/>the  Connect  Marketplace  Event  in  Michigan  to  promote  MICE  to  over  50  participants  and  the 
<br/>Treasures  of  the  South  Pacific  Roadshow  in  Australia  that  head  over  a  100  trade  partners.    So, 
<br/>Tourism  Fiji  also  continues  to  work  with  the  group  of  travel  industry  and  trade  partners  such  as 
<br/>Luxury Escapes, Expedia and Master Cards, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect to other markets, we will, aside from the normal traditional markets, maintain the 
<br/>presents  in  the  Asian  markets  such  as  China  and  India  with  Tourism  Fiji  ready  to  roll  out  those 
<br/>particular market re-entry plans.  I hope that answers his question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  the  reply.    Just  digressing  a  bit,  he  mentioned  about  services  to  Los  Angeles,  San 
<br/>Francisco and Vancouver.  Los Angeles has problems meeting the capacity of passengers from all 
<br/>over the world and people suffer.  I know the Government Ministers do not go through the normal 
<br/>process when they land in Los Angeles but it is a very difficult airport.  It is almost inhumane.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, there is also Houston and Chicago, just to take that pressure away from Los 
<br/>Angeles.  I think the daily service there with all the pressure that we are getting, it is really unbearable.  
<br/>I used the term inhumane, I was just there two weeks or three weeks ago.  We need to prevail upon 
<br/>the authorities there to improve the services or go to Houston or other ports in the United States.         
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I think that is probably a question for Fiji Airways for one but 
<br/>mostly, it has to be a commercial decision that is made.  It is this very honourable Gavoka that was 
<br/>actually objecting to our A350 in the first place.  So it has to be a commercial decision that is made 
<br/>with respect to where we go and it is a well thought-out, well-researched subject when we actually 
<br/>go to anywhere, whether it is Hong Kong, Los Angeles or San Francisco …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Offer something else please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So, you cannot just suddenly decide that you  want to go to Chicago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It was in the press actually. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- As I have said, Sir, it is a very well-informed, well-calculated way in 
<br/>which  Fiji  Airways  does  the  routing  in  conjunction  with  Tourism  Fiji,  they  do  all  the  necessary 
<br/>number crunching exercises.  Right now, the best route for us is Vancouver and we have done so, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  O’CONNOR.-  A  supplementary  question,  Sir;  can  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update Parliament on how Fiji is tracking to achieve its visitor arrival targets?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the question.  From January to 
<br/>July 2022, we received 284,167 visitors, which is 56.4 percent of the arrivals in the same period in 
<br/>2019.  In July 2022, Fiji received 78,638 visitors and that is an 81.6 percent recovery of July 2019 
<br/>levels and, I think we need to really realise what we have actually done here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is actually unbelievable in terms of the short space of time that we have been able to get 
<br/>back on our feet, Sir.  By the year end, we expect to recover 55 percent of the 2019 levels in terms 
<br/></span><span>of arrivals and that in money terms, would mean more than $1.3 billion in tourism earnings and by 
<br/></span><span>2024, we actually expect a fully recovery.  It is safe to say that we expect to exceed our expectations, 
<br/>Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reimbursement for UN Peacekeeping Missions 
<br/>(Question No. 143/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>the  UN 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update  Parliament  on 
<br/>reimbursement for our troops in UN peacekeeping missions?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member  for  the  question  raised.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  has  a  long  history  of  supporting  UN 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2107</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>peacekeeping missions, stretching back to our first contribution in 1978 to the UN Interim Forces in 
<br/>Lebanon or UNIFIL.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  RFMF  and  the  Fiji  Police  Force  are  still  charged  with  providing  forces  for 
<br/>international  peacekeeping  operations,  in  line  with  government’s  foreign  commitment  on 
<br/>maintaining world peace.   This is an ongoing commitment between the Fijian Government and the 
<br/>United Nations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the missions, we still have forces now in  the United 
<br/>Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria,  UNIFIL in Lebanon, United Nations 
<br/>Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).  I have also included in my response the Multinational Forces 
<br/>and Observers (MFO), although it is a non-UN Mission and, of course, we have the United Nations 
<br/>Mission in South Sudan (UNMIS) and United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in 
<br/>Sudan  (UNITAMS)  and  of  course,  we  have  the  mission  in  Yemen  where  we  have  one  officer  I 
<br/>believe, it is Major Ieli who is there, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will detail the reimbursements from 2015.  In 2015, the reimbursement to 
<br/>the Government of Fiji was around $12,846,973.81.  Again, in 2016, it was $12,147,018.26.  In 2017, 
<br/>the reimbursement was $19,638,315.52.  In 2018, the reimbursement was $10,328,111.98.  In 2019, 
<br/>again,  it  was  $10,637.083.57.    In  2020,  an  amount  of  $6,444,326.65;  in  2021,  an  amount  of 
<br/></span><span>$4,1,929.79; and in 2022, the reimbursement is a total of $15,709,188.79. So, if we add those figures 
<br/></span><span>from 2015 to 2022, the total reimbursement to the Government of Fiji is around $91,780,940.37. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly, there will be another meeting in New York in February next year, where we 
<br/>will have an opportunity to again discuss the rates, particularly when it comes to the equipment used.  
<br/>That will be in around February next year, Sir.

<div><span>Rural Local Authority Activities in Kadavu 
<br/>(Question No. 144/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/>update Parliament on the mandate of the Suva City Council with respect to the rural local 
<br/>authority activities in Kadavu?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.  -  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amendment  of  the  Public  Health  Act  2018 
<br/>allowed  designated  rural  areas  including  the  maritime  islands  to  be  brought  under  municipal 
<br/></span><span>authorities for basic services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as per the amalgamation, the Municipal Councils are required to administer 
<br/>the areas outside of the town boundaries by providing sanitary services  and development  permits 
<br/>management.    Since  then  the  Municipal  Councils  have  been  providing  services  in  this  extended 
<br/>boundaries which was previously serviced by Rural Local Authorities. Kadavu was assigned to Suva 
<br/>City Council to manage development permits and solid waste management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In demarcated planning scheme areas such as public facilities, business house, government 
<br/>stations and special used area.  With the inclusion of Kadavu, a budget of $50,000 is given to Suva 
<br/>City Council to collect solid waste in Vunisea.  This includes providing public bins and collection of 
<br/>waste in public areas within the proximity of the Vunisea Market.  The Suva City Council (SCC) 
<br/>collects wastes from the market and within the Vunisea Village using hired open trucks as a current 
<br/>practice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that SCC has invested in 20 composed bins in 2021 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for use at Government Stations in Kadavu.  Apart from the sanitary services that they provide, SCC 
<br/>also  manages  development  permits  on  the  island  of  Kadavu,  four  applications  were  received  for 
<br/>Kadavu  in  2021  and  2022.  The  applications  are  for  three  school  buildings  and  one  commercial 
<br/>application for a retail shop. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition the Council is also responsible for the satellite market in Vunisea 
<br/>and  discussions  are  underway  with  UN  Women  and  Suva  City  Council  to  upgrade  the  Vunisea 
<br/>Market this financial year at a cost of $70,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I would like to thank the Honourable Minister for the update about 
<br/>Kadavu.    When  you  are  talking  about  Kadavu  that  is  Vunisea,  are  you  also  intending  to  take  on 
<br/>Kavala? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this stage - basic services in Vunisea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.-  Does the extent of development  in  Kadavu warrants declaring 
<br/>Kadavu as a rural local authority or do you need more development for tourist purposes, industrial, 
<br/>manufacturing, et cetera? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to start off with, there is no such thing as rural local 
<br/>authority.  It  is  an  extended  boundary  that  comes  under  Suva  City  Council  and  Kadavu  is  still 
<br/>developing.  I mean, if you want to turn that into a small municipality or small town, I do not think 
<br/>Kadavu is ready yet because with that will come the rates and I wonder whether the people of Kadavu 
<br/>is ready to pay rates.  But along with the rate also means that we have to provide the basic services 
<br/>like the roads, the other infrastructure and other services so at this stage I do not think so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022 Economic Forecast 
<br/>(Question No. 145/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Economy, Civil Service, Communication, Housing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Community Development update Parliament on the economic forecast for 2022?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I like to also thank the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s domestic economy is  on track for a strong rebound this  year after 
<br/>consecutive  years  of  decline  which  adversely  affected  jobs,  public  finances  and  socio-economic 
<br/>conditions.  After minor decline of 0.6 percent in 2019 the economy recorded a severe contraction of 
<br/>17.2 percent in 2020 followed by a further estimated decline of 4.1 percent in 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the sooner than expected reopening of the international 
<br/>borders in December last year as a result of Government engaging in massive vaccination programme 
<br/>and the subsequent resurgence for the tourism sector the Fijian economy is now recovering strongly 
<br/>with double digit growth of 12.4 percent projected for 2022.  If realised, Sir, this would mark Fiji’s 
<br/>highest ever GDP growth on record.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022 forecast which is an upward revision from the earlier projection 
<br/>of 11.3 percent is based on the earlier resumption of tourism given our strong vaccination progress 
<br/>and the rebound in other key sectors such as fisheries, manufacturing, construction and transport.  
<br/>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is projected at 9.2 percent for 2023 and 5 percent for 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2109</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the upward revision is also consistent with the latest sentiments of the Asian 
<br/>Development  Bank  (ADB)  which  recently  upgraded  its  2022  growth  projection  for  Fiji  from  7.8 
<br/>percent  to  11.7  percent  and  the  strong  performances  in  tourism-related  sectors  and  an  expected 
<br/>rebound in tax collections particularly VAT as jobs are being restored. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  should  also  be  noted  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  Fiji’s  revised  forecast  is  quite  conservative 
<br/>compared to other GDP growth forecast for 2022 such as the warping 23.2 percent growth projected 
<br/>by ANZ and 12.9 percent projected by Westpac.  Fiji’s revised growth of 12.4 percent is predicated 
<br/>on the assumption that visitor arrivals will reach around 55 percent of pre-pandemic arrivals this year.  
<br/>The recovery of the tourism industry is critical for our recovery prospects given the dominance of 
<br/>the industry throughout the wider economy and it accounts for roughly 40 percent of our GDP both 
<br/>directly and indirectly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this revised forecast is upward biased meaning essentially the actual GDP 
<br/>growth for 2022 could be much higher than what is projected.  That is because we are likely to surpass 
<br/>our visitor arrivals target for the year with the current trajectory of tourism inflows is maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted by the honourable Minister for Tourism visitor arrivals in July 2022 stood at 
<br/></span><span>78,638 which is 81.6 percent of July 2019 levels.  Furthermore, total cumulative arrivals from January 
<br/></span><span>to July: 284,167 which is 56.4 percent of arrivals in the same period in 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notably Sir, Australia’s visitor arrivals in July this year: 37,005 - already surpassed 2019 July 
<br/>levels which is 36,799 (100.6 percent higher).  Similarly Sir, New Zealand arrivals are 90.3 percent 
<br/>of July 2019 levels while US arrivals are 93.6 percent of July 2019 levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, strong forward bookings with our national carrier; Fiji Airways hinted even better 
<br/>tourism numbers as we move beyond the traditional peak period of July to August.  The economic 
<br/>recovery is also evident Sir, on the sectorial front.  The positive spill of tourism rebound have fuelled 
<br/>stronger  consumption  and  investment  spending  over  the  first  half  of  the  year.    The  uptake  in 
<br/>consumption spending  is reflected by higher Pay As You Earn (PAYE) or plus which is an increase 
<br/>of about 12.3 percent and net Value Added Tax (VAT) increase of about 61 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These collections in the year to June, together with strong commercial bank new consumption 
<br/>lending  which  has  increased  by  58.4  percent  and  total  vehicle  registration  which  has  actually 
<br/>increased by 44 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of construction and investment activities, domestic cement sales; a new lending for 
<br/></span><span>investment purposes rose over the first six months of the year when compared to 2021.  Likewise in 
<br/>the March quarter of 2022, the number of building permits, completion certificates issued and value 
<br/>of work put in place all increased relative to the December quarter of 2021 as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  however  rising  labour  and  construction  material  cost,  supply  chain 
<br/>bottlenecks and the uncertainties surrounding current geo-political tensions could impede investment 
<br/>spending to some extent throughout the remainder of the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Sir, as highlighted previously, we have got three projects at the moment between 
<br/>the Nadi-Lautoka corridor totalling about $200 million.  One has already started, I think the other 
<br/>two will be ready in the next couple of months’ time too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall Mr. Speaker, Sir, and these (I should say) Fijian investors were taken advantage of 
<br/>the  high  levels  of  liquidity  and  investing  in  the  future.    Fiji’s  macro-economic  fundamentals  are 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strong, the financial sector remains sound and foreign reserves are currently sitting at $3.6 billion 
<br/>were equivalent to 8.4 months of retained import cover as at 29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, liquidity levels in the financial system sits at $2.6 billion as at 29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 and 
<br/>these have helped to maintain the low interest rate environment which is actually being critical to the 
<br/>recovery momentum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings an end to question time for today, there 
<br/>being no Written Questions.  That also brings us to the end of the sitting for today.  Dinner for all 
<br/>honourable Members will be ready soon, the caterers are on their way here so we adjourn Parliament 
<br/>until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
