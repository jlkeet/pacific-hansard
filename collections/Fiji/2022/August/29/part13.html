<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Attorney-General to speak on his motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all very familiar with the Fiji 
<br/>Development  Bank  which  was  established  under  the  Fiji  Development  Act  1966.    The  Bank,  of 
<br/>course, is an autonomous statutory body and provides financing that contributes to the development 
<br/>of Fiji and economy, leading to the enhancement of the quality of the life of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without  going  into  too  much  detail  as  we  will  be  debating  this  later,  the  Act  itself  under 
<br/>sections 7, 17 and 39 of the Act makes reference to the terms “servants” and “servant”. The use of 
<br/></span><span>these terms are, of course, very archaic, a reflective of the colonial past that we have had and the 
<br/></span><span>influence on the laws which was passed in 1966.  We wish to, Mr. Speaker, Sir, amend the word or 
<br/>replace  the  word  “servant”  and  “servants”  with  “employee”  and  “employees”.    That  is  all  this 
<br/>amendment seeks to do.  I do not think we need to go to a Committee for that.  If you see this simple 
<br/>amendment  to  the  Bill,  which  the  Members  already  have,  it  replaces  the  word  “servant”  and 
<br/>“servants” with the words “employee” and “employees”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/>the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover.  Does any Member wish to take 
<br/>the floor?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  no  Member  wishes  to  take  the  floor,  I  will  give  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General if you have anything further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed.  
<br/></span></div>
