<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION  
<br/>AUGUST 2016-JULY 2017 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of Fiji Higher Education Commission August 2016 – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>July 2017 Annual Report which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Higher Education Commission (FHEC) oversees 
<br/>the development and the improvement of higher education in Fiji with the aim of ensuring that learners 
<br/>have the best possible opportunity to gain relevant qualifications required to support and sustain Fiji’s 
<br/>economic and social prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FHEC regulates the registration and operation of all higher education institutions, ensuring 
<br/></span><span>they meet quality standards and guidelines that reflect national and international imperatives.  It is also 
<br/></span><span>responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  the  Fiji  Qualifications  Framework  which  enables  Fiji’s 
<br/>qualifications to be measured both, in Fiji and internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission was established as a statutory body in 2010 under the Fiji Higher Education Act 
<br/>2008. During the scrutiny of the Commission’s August 2016 to July 2017 Annual Report, some pertinent 
<br/>findings were made by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  the  FHEC  was  reviewed  in  2017,  to  ensure  that  it  remains  on  par  with  that  of  other 
<br/>international qualifications frameworks.  Furthermore, progress was made on the creation of a Higher 
<br/>Education Commission System to enable access by Higher Education Institution to upload learner data 
<br/>and other necessary data for higher education. We note that this initiative will subsequently facilitate data 
<br/>integration onto the Fiji Education Management Information System.  The review of the Commission’s 
<br/>Human Resource systems and processes  were also carried out in 2017 by  KPMG.  This review  was 
<br/>undertaken  to  strengthen  the  Commission’s  Human  Resources  functions  including  its  Performance 
<br/>Assessment System.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The goal of higher education in Fiji is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enable all Fijians to realise their potential in contributing to a just, peaceful and sustainable 
<br/>nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving access to quality higher education in Fiji will contribute to both the economy 
<br/>and the society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Equity will be progressed by special provision for disadvantage groups and communities, 
<br/>particularly in those areas of study and locations where the disparity is identified, especially 
<br/>amongst  youth,  early  school  leavers,  the  unemployed  and  the  under-employed,  people 
<br/>living with disabilities and rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for the Report.  As the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chairman has stated, the role of the Fiji Higher Education Commission is an important one. He talked 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the qualifications framework again that is an important task but Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by 
<br/>saying that we are looking at 2016 - 2017 Report.  As we had said before in this Parliament, it is quite 
<br/>disappointing that these institutions or bodies, and we have seen many government departments, many 
<br/>ministries annual reports are always late and sometimes we are looking at these reports issues three, four 
<br/>or five years after it is done.  But let me reflect on some of the fundamental issues with respect to Higher 
<br/>Education Institutions and in particular those which were put in place in a way to support different types 
<br/>of qualifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  had  the  Fiji  Institute  of  Technology  (now  FNU)  mainly  concentrating  on  TVET, 
<br/>technical skills and unfortunately Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2010 and more so since 2013 or 2014, there has 
<br/>been a lot of changes within the education system let alone what has happened to higher education system.  
<br/>Today the lack of vision, the ability of the Government to look at what was happening and to assess the 
<br/>effectiveness of some of those reforms, we find ourselves today in a very, very deep hole not only in 
<br/>terms of the qualifications, the skills that are needed in this country but also in terms of the quality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  heard  the  honourable  Attorney-General  yesterday  talk  about  how  the  Government  needs  to 
<br/>invest in creating more skills.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, his Government has been responsible for the state of 
<br/></span><span>decay that we have in terms of the skills.  People have been migrating over so many years.  There might 
<br/></span><span>be a lot more going now. A lot more demand in Australia and New Zealand but for so many years we 
<br/>had  a  system  which  was  producing  enough  people.  The  tertiary  institutions  were  producing  enough 
<br/>people the Fiji Institute of Technology (FIT) then Fiji National University (FNU).  I mean Honourable 
<br/>Usamate  knows.    He  knows  the  value  of  what  some  of  those  systems  where  in  terms  of  producing 
<br/>technical skills in this country.  We know the story of the technical colleges. We spend millions of dollars 
<br/>and what happened; collapsed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had this very good system in schools where we had vocational training and there was this 
<br/>progression to the old Fiji National Training Centre (FNTC) in terms of gaining qualifications.  The result 
<br/>today is a complete destruction of the ability of this country right now to produce technical skills. Those 
<br/>are issues that the Fiji Higher Education Commission and I am sure we are looking at the 2016/2017 
<br/>Report but they would be looking at what should happen in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have called for not only in terms of Higher Education Institution but we have 
<br/>called for the holistic review of the education system. We have been calling for an Education Commission 
<br/>in this country because it is important to look at what has happened in the last 15 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  urge  the  Higher  Education  Commission  to  look  at  the  tertiary 
<br/>institutions and the failure of technical  college  and what is the  alternative.    I  know they  cut  Tertiary 
<br/>Education loans Scheme (TELS) to TVET Programme at USP whether we are producing enough right 
<br/>now from FNU. What sort of skills are been produced?  These are important questions that not only the 
<br/>Higher Education Commission  would be concerned about the curriculum and the quality but as a country, 
<br/>we are concerned about and the biggest bottleneck, Mr. Speaker, you know going forward in the next 
<br/>four or five years will be the lack of technical skills in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to continue and refer to the Higher Education Commission Report and the 
<br/>Appendix.  This is in relation to funding for Higher Education institutions. This is the question that was 
<br/>put to the Fiji Higher Education Commission, and it says; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Fiji Higher Education Commission through its funding model plays an important role 
<br/>in advising the Government on funding allocation for eligible Higher Education Institutions.  
<br/></span><span>In recognition of the critical role they play as such what advice the Commission gave to the 
<br/></span><span>Government on the detrimental effects of withholding grant to the University of the South 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2069 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific (USP). In the Commission assessment how will this affect national development and 
<br/>what will be the mid-term, long term impact on the provision of quality tertiary education to 
<br/>students”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the HEC says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The HEC anticipates the matters of interest are resolved in a timely manner between 
<br/>parties to minimise further deception to the quality of teaching and learning experience in this 
<br/>challenging environment”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee actually posed a good question, Mr. Speaker, to the HEC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  put  this  issue  of  funding  to  USP  perspective  because  we  have  heard  so  many  lies, 
<br/>misinformation and deviousness  you know in terms of  what is the real issue.    In  here,  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>because it is important in this Parliament to let this out very clearly and I want to do that.  It is very 
<br/>important for us to understand that because withholding of funding to the USP is having a very, very 
<br/>serious impact.  Not only on the students from Fiji but students throughout the region and for us as a 
<br/>country as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there was a statement which was put by the USP Staff Association and I thought 
<br/>they let it out  very, very well and I want to refer to some of those issues.  It says for example, that when 
<br/>the new Vice-Chancellor Professor Pal Ahluwalia was appointed, during his induction period, he put a 
<br/>report to the University Council of the financial mismanagement and other issues that took place.  When 
<br/>that went to the Council, the first inquiry took place following the March 2019 report titled, “Issues, 
<br/>Concerns and Breaches of Past Management and Financial Decisions” by the new Vice-Chancellor and 
<br/>President Pal Ahluwalia to the Executive Committee of the University Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  financial  mismanagement  and  failure  to  comply  with  university  regulations  and 
<br/>procedures by the previous administration.  This administration was overseen by the then Pro-Chancellor, 
<br/>Winston  Thompson  and  led  by  former  Vice-Chancellor  Rajesh  Chandra.    The  serious  nature  of  the 
<br/>allegations and the evidence provided saw the Council agreeing to the appointment of an independent 
<br/>accounting firm to examine the issues raised by Professor Pal Ahluwalia.  The company appointed was 
<br/>the Auckland BDO and the independent BDO inquiry concurred with nearly all the complaints made in 
<br/>that paper. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is pertinent, therefore, to note that BDO had accessed to emails and relevant 
<br/></span><span>communications at the direction of the Council Chair of the Audit Risk Committee and the then Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Pro-Chancellor and BDO.  According to the Staff Association and the report that they produced found 
<br/>nothing with regards to Professor Ahluwalia’s management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent Inquiry No. 2, the USP Special Council Meeting held in Nadi and the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  was  in  that  meeting.    I  know  it  was  a  three  member  person  committee  that  was 
<br/>appointed from that Council meeting.  This Committee intend that committee by the then Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister of Samoa and now Prime Minister, honourable Attorney-General and the former Prime Minister 
<br/>of the Cook Islands.  They appointed a three member Commission to work through the recommendations 
<br/>in  the  BDO  report  and  to  rumper  the  University’s  governance  structure  and  procedures  to  prevent 
<br/>maladministration and financial mismanagement in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission’s recommendations were accepted by the University Council and the University 
<br/>Administration  has  been  systematically  implementing  those  recommendations.    The  three  member 
<br/>commission did not report any adverse finance relating to Professor Ahluwalia’s management.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2070 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent Inquiry No. 3, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since Professor Pal Ahluwalia’s reporting of the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>breaches of management and finances in March, 2019, there have been continuous efforts to discredit 
<br/>him  by  the  Pro-Chancellor  Mr.  Winston  Thompson,  who  unsuccessfully  sought  to  terminate  his 
<br/>employment.  The discrediting action took the form of 26 alleged allegation of mismanagement against 
<br/>Professor Ahluwalia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another 33 unsubstantiated allegations levelled by the Chair of the Audit Risk Committee shortly 
<br/>after.  Professor Ahluwalia was suspended for 10 days in June, 2020 by the hastily convened executive 
<br/>committee.  This decision was overturned by the Full Council and he was reinstated.  Nevertheless for 
<br/>good  governance  purposes,  the  Council  appointed  a  sub-committee  chaired  by  Australian  Professor 
<br/>Caroline  McMillen  who  investigated  the  33  allegations  inclusive  of  the  26  and  cleared  Professor 
<br/>Ahluwalia for any mismanagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent Inquiry No. 4 called Project Dinero, KPMG still not satisfied with the USP Council 
<br/>decisions.  The Pro-Chancellor Winston Thompson and Mr. Mahmood Khan, chair of the Audit Risk 
<br/>Committee instituted another investigation name Project Dinero investigation by KPMG.  That project 
<br/>report was available in draft in early 2020 and published in August 2020.  KPMG confirmed that no 
<br/>financial mismanagement had occurred under Professor Pal Ahluwalia.  In fact, the University was in a 
<br/></span><span>stronger financial position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Independent Inquiry No. 5, when all these failed on the part of those 
<br/>who wanted to get rid of him and following Professor Pal Ahluwalia’s deportation and we all know that  
<br/>it was just a Gestapo style of deportation, there was a fundamental attack on academic freedom and 
<br/>human  rights  then  the  Chair  of  Audit  and  Risk  Committee,  Mr.  Mahmood  Khan  and  then  Pro-
<br/>Chancellor  continued  their  claims  by  pointing  another  KPMG  investigation  in  the  alleged 
<br/>mismanagement by Professor Ahluwalia and his senior management colleagues. These allegations 
<br/>repeated the 16 page report by PC Thompson  in Nadi in 2019 and the 26 and 33 allegations, as well 
<br/>as they are after the new unsubstantiated  allegations.  KPMG report titled “Projects Striker” had in 
<br/>terms  of  reference  set  by  Mr.  Khan  and  Mr.  Thompson  and  included  all  the  allegations  that  the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy  made,  you  know  calling  for  another 
<br/>investigation.  In considering this striker report, the USP Council agreed that there was no material 
<br/>misconduct and again exonerated Professor Pal Ahluwalia and his senior management team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these inquires have clearly, cleared any allegations of mismanagement 
<br/>by  the  new  Vice-Chancellor  and  the  new  senior  management.    When  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General came to Parliament, you know, they have come to Parliament on a number of occasions and 
<br/></span><span>said “oh, we are withholding grant because we feel there is mismanagement”.  How many times you 
<br/></span><span>want to have an inquiry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which includes Ministers and Leaders of the Region which 
<br/>includes Australia and New Zealand, who have the skills, who have the knowledge in that Council, 
<br/>to  determine  whether  those  allegations  had  any  substance  or  any  material.    And  all  those 
<br/>investigations and two initiated by those who were making those allegations, cleared the man, cleared 
<br/>the university management  of  any wrong doing.  Now, the Higher Education Commission  or the 
<br/>Standing Committee was right in asking that question, why is the Government so   unconcerned about 
<br/>the damage that they are doing to the University of the South Pacific?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you hold funding, you do not just give students TELS loans and send 
<br/>them to the university. When they go to the university, they need good lecturers, they need qualify 
<br/>lecturers, experience lecturers, they need the facilities, they need the classrooms, they need recreation 
<br/>facilities, they need libraries, they need books, they need computers, and they need labs.  These are 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2071 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>facilities that universities have to provide to the students.  When you hold grants to the university, 
<br/>you are damaging the quality of education that our students get.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that they do not understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is where I think the 
<br/>Higher Education Commission, if it is an independent institution, it should tell the Government that 
<br/>what they are doing is destroying the quality of tertiary education in this country, especially for our 
<br/>students who go and study at the University of the South Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have talked about the Fiji Government being the largest contributor,  yes, in terms of 
<br/>grant we might be the largest contributor or the university’s budget is closed to about $130 million 
<br/>or $140 million and Fiji Government contribution is around $30 million to $40 million a year.  Of 
<br/>course, we provide scholarships, we provide TELS loan to our students because we have to pay the 
<br/>fees like other countries do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The biggest beneficiary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of funding allocation to the University of the South 
<br/>Pacific is Fiji’s students, Fiji’s parents and it also adds to the economy, the spending that people who 
<br/>work in the university, the students who go and study there, those who come from the region, what 
<br/>is holding this Government?  They come and read an anonymous letter here in Parliament but here, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  a Council which has investigated all the allegations that they made and their 
<br/></span><span>people made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one day when Mr. Thompson and Mr. Mahmood Khan ordered that 
<br/>investigation on their own, it was breached of the Council’s policy.  In fact, the Council sacked Mr. 
<br/>Mahmood  Khan  as  the  Chair  of  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  for  being  unethical  and  there  was  a 
<br/>warning letter sent to Mr. Thompson for being unethical.  Yet, we see these two individuals are all 
<br/>over the place, Government thinks this is the Council that made the decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear that this Government have made this decision because they 
<br/>did not like one man. God knows why but in the action, they are destroying an international reputable 
<br/>regional institution by holding this grant.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they will shed the ego and 
<br/>arrogance and forget about an individual.  Look at the bigger picture, look at the institution, and look 
<br/>at Fiji’s history in keeping the regional university as a premier tertiary institution in the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at the bigger picture, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Pal Ahluwalia is not going to be the 
<br/>Vice-Chancellor for all his life, no one is going to be there for all their life but the university has been 
<br/>there since 1968. Mr. Speaker, Sir,  that is why and I think in some sense, it is criminal because some 
<br/>of the grants that were withheld were approved by Parliament, especially in 2017 and 2018 for the 
<br/></span><span>Government to hold the grant of the University of the South Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I speak on behalf of the parents, the students, the staff and everyone out 
<br/>there in the region, let us not penalise this institution because long after we are all gone, the university 
<br/>will still be there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  On that note, honourable Members, we will take a break for lunch.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.32 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with our debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk on this motion that 
<br/>is  before  Parliament.    First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  say  thank  you  to  the  Standing  Committee  that  is 
<br/>responsible for going through the 2016 and 2017 Reports, as has been mentioned that the reports occurred 
<br/>a few years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The comment that I would like to make is that, it is good to see the continuous growth of the Fiji 
<br/>Higher Education Commission.  In the Reports that we are discussing today, looking at the Committee’s 
<br/>observations, I totally endorse the observations that have been made by the Committee on page 7 of the 
<br/>Report,  about  the  development  of  the  quality  standards  of  the  Fiji  Higher  Education  that  has  been 
<br/>strengthened and the efforts to register higher education institutes and quality assurance programmes that 
<br/>they  offer.    It  has  been  good  to  see  this  development  because  over  the  past  12  years,  the  national 
<br/>qualification framework originally are part of that framework established just to look at TVET, but to see 
<br/>over the years the integration of technical and skills training together with academic type of education so 
<br/>that there can be similar  movement between the two streams.  So the development over the past few 
<br/></span><span>years has been something that has been very useful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I notice also with a lot of appreciation, the reactivation of the Fiji Qualifications Council.  I think 
<br/>one  of  the  challenges  that  we  have  seen  over  the  years  is  the  importance  of  having  portability  of 
<br/>qualifications between different institutions in the country so that they can recognise what each other has 
<br/>done.  I can remember a few years ago, we used to have people attending programmes at Montfort Boys 
<br/>Town  which  was  renowned  for  being  amongst  the  best  in  producing  people  in  doing  Fitting  and 
<br/>Machinery, but later on when they wanted to move to the next stage of qualifications to go to the Fiji 
<br/>Institute of Technology, they had to redo what they had already done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  system  of  the  Fiji  Qualifications  Council  where  we  have  nationally  established 
<br/>qualifications and everyone is trying to implement the same set of national qualification, it removes the 
<br/>duplication of people having to learn the same thing twice, because everything the people have learnt, 
<br/>counts towards the qualification they have.  I am very glad to see that the Qualifications Council and its 
<br/>processes have been rejuvenated in the process of the Fiji Higher Education Commission.  I have always 
<br/>believed that the Fiji Higher Education Commission has a very important role in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  challenges  that  we  had  over  decades,  not  only  since  the  birth  of  the  Fiji  Higher 
<br/></span><span>Education Commission, but even before that, during the time of the Fiji National Training Council, during 
<br/></span><span>the time when we had the National Apprenticeship Board that used to be part of the Ministry of Labour, 
<br/>we have always had this issue of developing enough skilled workers in terms of TVET, people with skills, 
<br/>people who are able to fix cars, build houses, fix machines, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past few years, I have noticed also that one of the particular challenges that we have is 
<br/>that, when we integrate this into the world of academia, some of the things that we reward in academia 
<br/>might not necessarily assist us in developing skilled workers.  What I mean, for instance, is in the world 
<br/>of academia, people get their progress in terms of their salaries according to their qualifications.  If you 
<br/>have the Masters or PhD, then your salary increases.  For the development of the skilled workers, what 
<br/>we really need is people who have the industrial ability to do the job, they are the ones who need to teach.  
<br/>So sometimes, there can be a bit of misfit between the world of the academia and what you need to reward 
<br/>for people who can develop skills training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is one of the areas that the Fiji Higher Education Commission as part of its overall 
<br/>progress  towards  developing  skilled  workers  need  to  look  at.    For  instance,  if  you  want  to  develop 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2073 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>someone to be a skilled carpenter, you need to make sure that people who are teaching them are skilled 
<br/>carpenters on their own and not people who just have the paper qualifications to do this.  So, obviously 
<br/>in the Fiji Higher Education Commission, they also need to be able to look at the systems they have to 
<br/>make sure that the right people are teaching.  We have had a lot of experiences of people going into 
<br/>training programmes and finding out that those who are teaching do not have the ability.  So I am glad to 
<br/>see that the Fiji Qualifications Council has been put in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just hoping that the Fiji Higher Education Commission and the Fiji National University and 
<br/>all of the relevant bodies put in measures to make sure they have the right people teaching so that people 
<br/>come out not just with the theoretical knowledge, but also with the practical knowledge to be able to 
<br/>deliver whatever it is that they are supposed to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  few  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  totally  endorse  the  Report  before  Parliament  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to speak very briefly on the 
<br/>issues that are reflected in the report.  I thank the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/>for a very good report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An  important  finding,  as  alluded  to  by  the  Chairman,  is  on  the  review  of  the  Fiji  National 
<br/>Qualifications Framework in 2017, to ensure it remains in par with that of other international frameworks.  
<br/>It is an important finding by the Standing Committee as it is an indication, it has to be rectified in ensuring 
<br/>that the Fiji National Qualification Frameworks is in compliance with the proven international standards, 
<br/>more importantly, in recognition of its status.  Not only that, its long term effects will be developed and 
<br/>strengthen its organisational capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other important issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the annual reports is in terms of the 
<br/>access by higher education institution to upload learner data and other necessary data for higher education.  
<br/>Informal data collection is  an  integral part  as  far as  collaboration is  concerned and human  resources 
<br/>should be qualified to carry out this role.  It is quite necessary that data is readily available and given that 
<br/>this report is from 2017, it is hoped that whatever findings that were identified, the Fiji Higher Education 
<br/>Commission should have taken steps in complying what has been reported in the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  incumbent  upon  the  Commission  that  monitoring  and  periodic 
<br/>assessment  is  conducted  and  the  National  Qualification  Framework  is  strengthened  especially  its 
<br/>relationship with its overseas counterparts like the New Zealand agencies and the institutions that express 
<br/></span><span>an interest in developing Fiji’s higher education sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  strengthening  the  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  is  quite  a  big  task 
<br/>especially its monitoring framework and mechanism to ensure compliance and this will require human 
<br/>resources to carry out these tasks.  With the required staff and appropriate remuneration, it will result in 
<br/>a vibrant organisation.  In one of the questions that was posed from the Committee, it says, if I may read: 
<br/>‘With the Government’s pledge to leaving no one behind, how does Fiji Higher Education Commission 
<br/>collaborate with higher education institutions to ensure that students living with disabilities are given 
<br/>equal access to learning opportunities, have ease of physical access to higher education premises and are 
<br/>sufficiently equipped with tools to assist them in learning for example, assistive devices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The higher education institutions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensure that the training facilities and premises 
<br/>are  adequately  resourced  with  disability  accessibilities.    Education  staff  are  well  trained  to  provide 
<br/>training and services for these special groups and appropriate strategies and support services are offered 
<br/>to enable them to attain their learning potential fully.

<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Blind  Society,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  although  it  is  mandated  to  protect  its  students  and 
<br/>safeguard the welfare of its learning capabilities and special needs, the onus lies on Government to ensure 
<br/>that they are especially equipped in terms of braille.  The schools need these machines and the support 
<br/>services that are urgently required by the Society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this 
<br/>motion.  The Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts acknowledges the recommendations made by the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs relating to the Fiji Higher Education Commission’s Annual Report 
<br/>August 2016 to July 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to update Parliament on the recent developments at the Commission.  
<br/>From the beginning of 2022, the Commission has appointed a new director of the Fiji Higher Education 
<br/>Commission who is well qualified with a longstanding academic and professional career having worked 
<br/>at both international and national higher education institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Commission  has  also  appointed  a  new  board  that  comprises  experienced  academic  and 
<br/>professional experts under the very capable leadership of the Chair, Mr. Winston Thompson.  The new 
<br/>board  is  made  up  of  technical  people  who  can  critically  assess  quality  and  standards.    Recently  the 
<br/></span><span>Commission  held  a  successful  inaugural  forum  with  the  vision  of  transforming  the  higher  education 
<br/></span><span>sector to align quality higher education qualifications with labour market needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Higher Education Commission regulates the registration and operation of 
<br/>all higher education institutes in Fiji to ensure they meet quality standards and guidelines that reflect 
<br/>national  and  international  imperatives.    The  aim  of  the  Commission  is  to  make  higher  education 
<br/>responsive, relevant, resilient and sustainable for the economic wellbeing of individuals as well as for the 
<br/>nation’s development.   Sir, all those developments are aimed at improving the quality of higher education 
<br/>so that Fijians receive lifelong learning with internationally benchmarked higher education qualifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National Qualification Framework was first developed and implemented in 2012.  It was 
<br/>subsequently reviewed in 2017 after a period of five years to ensure that the Fiji National Qualification 
<br/>Framework is fit  for purpose  and that the  Framework is internationally  benchmarked  for  proper  and 
<br/>accurate translation of Fijian qualifications globally.  The next appraisal is due and the Commission is 
<br/>carrying out an intensive stakeholder consultation to review its qualification framework by considering 
<br/>new challenges and demands of a fast changing economy and the society.  This work is expected to 
<br/>complete by the end of 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  collection  and  integration  of  data  which  honourable  Leawere  highlighted,  the 
<br/></span><span>Commission will roll-out the Higher Education Commission System (HECS).  By July 2023 that will 
<br/>contain  learner  data  and  other  relevant  higher  education  data  for  integration  with  Fiji  Education 
<br/>Management Information System (FEMIS).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, HECS is an online system developed in-house without any additional cost.  The 
<br/>HECS will be similar to how the New Zealand and Australian higher education regulatory authorities 
<br/>manage and sustain their operations.  Once completed and implemented HECS will integrate into FEMIS 
<br/>for longitudinal reporting of learner data from early childhood education to tertiary education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The HECS and FEMIS will be met to generate a comprehensive report on the employment trends 
<br/>of our graduates that is where they work after leaving higher education institutes.  Access to the systems 
<br/>will be given to the graduates for them to update their employment status in the system allowing both the 
<br/>Commission, the Ministry and the Ministry for Employment to have an up-to-date data on learners.  This 
<br/>will assist in developing policies for the higher education sector and also in workforce planning based on 
<br/>real-time information.  It will also assist in identifying skills shortage and oversupply in the job market.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2075 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such information will help the Commission to work with the higher education institutes to address the 
<br/>areas of skills shortage and areas of oversupply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, after completion of HECS project the Commission will ensure that all higher 
<br/>education institutions are trained to utilise the HECS effectively before it is implemented.  On the third 
<br/>recommendation, the Commission engaged the services of KPMG in 2018 to review and strengthen the 
<br/>human resource skills required at the Fiji Higher Education Commission to deliver its services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  KPMG  made  14  policy  recommendations  pertaining  to  the  human  resource 
<br/>processes and system which the Commission is now delivering.  Continuous upskilling and reskilling of 
<br/>staff members is part of the Commission’s annual business plan.  The Commission regularly conducts 
<br/>Skills Needs Assessment to identify the skills gap to provide Professional Development Programmes to 
<br/>its staff and staff are also sponsored to upgrade their qualifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The issue raised in the report that the Commission has not carried out a survey since 2017 to 
<br/>determine if all operating higher education institutes are registered and paying the appropriate fees is now 
<br/>being addressed in this financial year.  To date there are 42 higher education institutes registered with Fiji 
<br/>Higher Education Commission, eight are provisionally registered and 12 are with recognised only status.  
<br/></span><span>Fiji Higher Education Commission will carry out a nation-wide detailed survey to identify and register 
<br/></span><span>non-registered higher education institutes operating in Fiji to protect parents and consumers who access 
<br/>services from these institutions unknowingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission will also embark on public awareness programme to highlight the Commission’s 
<br/>role, registration process, other legislative requirements and penalties under the Higher Education Act 
<br/>2008 and the Regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning we have heard honourable Professor Prasad as usual had only one 
<br/>agenda and that is to use the Fiji Higher Education Commission Annual Report to talk about USP and to 
<br/>cover up anomalies and open favouritism that is going on at USP.  Unfortunately, NFP has turned this 
<br/>into a bigger issue each time when we meet in the Parliament and we know why.  We acknowledge two 
<br/>SODELPA Members of Parliament who had asked USP to allow an independent investigation into the 
<br/>allegation of corruption at the University and this was mainly to investigate claims of mismanagement, 
<br/>breaches, anomalies and open favouritism to non-meritorious appointment and promotions and that is 
<br/>what we want.  If there is nothing to hide, why do we not have the investigation so that we settle the 
<br/>matter?  We agree with SODELPA Member that one person is not bigger than USP, nor bigger than a 
<br/>member country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ball is in their court.  We have maintained our position that USP needs to be 
<br/>investigated independently and this was communicated through a letter dated 22</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2020 on 
<br/>serious allegations raised  by the  Audit Committee.  The USP Council appointed a  special  Executive 
<br/>Committee that stated that at least 14 of the 33 allegations by the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee 
<br/>required independent investigation. The Council ignored this recommendation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  is  not  aware  of  all  four  independent  investigations  which  Honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad spoke this morning.  Any investigation internally cannot be termed as independent - it 
<br/>is ironical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Exactly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is ironical that the first investigation conducted by BDO Auckland is 
<br/>treated as  Inquiry 1 against Vice Chancellor Professor Pal Ahluwalia.  The three member committee 
<br/>appointed by  the Council to implement the findings of the  BDO Report is treated as  Investigation 2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>2076 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>against Vice Chancellor Professor Pal Ahluwalia. An unknown investigation carried out by a council 
<br/>member is also treated as independent inquiry against Vice Chancellor Professor Pal Ahluwalia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- They do not know the meaning of independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  And  KPMG  Report  which  is  not  independent  is  also  seen  as  4th 
<br/>Independent inquiry. We all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, KPMG are the auditors of USP.  Sir, none of this is 
<br/>independent. Independent means an institution or a person not affiliated with USP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ball is in USP’s court and students, staff as well as alumni should know this. 
<br/>Why  is  one  man  bigger  and  more  important  than  the  university?  If  Vice  Chancellor  Professor  Pal 
<br/>Ahluwalia  thinks  he  has  not  done  anything  wrong,  then  why  is  he  worried  about  an  independent 
<br/>investigation?  Fiji’s stand has been consistently made clear several times.  We will resume grants once 
<br/>this investigation is undertaken.  We do not recognise any other investigation that has been mentioned by 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad also spoke about the education sector as if the 
<br/>Ministry of Education has done nothing over the years and we are just sitting in the office and really not 
<br/></span><span>bothered to look at the education sector.  We all know that the education sector needs to evolve over a 
<br/></span><span>period of time.  What we did 10  years ago can change over a  period of time and a good example is 
<br/>COVID-19.  We need to consider the difficulties the sector faced during that time and how we can include 
<br/>that in our big education sector plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just last Thursday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education launched the Education Sector 
<br/>Plan Development Programme and this Programme is going to analyse the education sector - where we 
<br/>are now and where we want to go rather than just talking about ‘We asked for the Education Commission 
<br/>….’  as  if  the  Education  Commission  is  the  only  tool  available.  Let  us  move  on.    There  are  other 
<br/>methodologies through which we can assess the education sector and then we can develop the plan with 
<br/>the  monitoring  plan,  funding,  et  cetera,  and  that  is  precisely  what  we  would  like  to  do  through  this 
<br/>development programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Leawere also talked about the people with disabilities and there are 
<br/>students at various higher education institute.  I just want to emphasise that it is actually this Government 
<br/>that has been providing scholarship for people with disabilities.  We recognise that and we are helping 
<br/>them  not  only  at  the  higher  education  institutes  but  we  have  made  a  number  of  secondary  schools 
<br/>inclusive where people with disabilities attend these schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Standing Committee for the Report which is very relevant and Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Higher Education Commission is working on the recommendations made by the Standing Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we dissect and debate the Reports on the Higher 
<br/>Education Commission,  we should bring the dialogue to what is relevant today  and what is the way 
<br/>forward for the country. For SODELPA, we are talking about a shift, the shift is to provide free tertiary 
<br/>education for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all accept the critical and important role the tertiary education plays in Fiji.  
<br/>We should consider the valuable benefits the tertiary education can bring to the nation and individual 
<br/>citizens.  The valuable benefits range from the economic, socio, political to academic and education.  
<br/>These significant benefits warrant an urgent shift in the attitude towards tertiary education.  Well that is 
<br/>the  right  to  free  elemental  education,  the  new  heights  pursued  by  SODELPA  will  bolster  the  Fijian 
<br/>economy with these new type of investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2077 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such a policy has all the key pillars of social and economic development.  SODELPA recognises 
<br/>that people especially the young people of Fiji, being one of the greatest resources of Fiji.  This investment 
<br/>will cost a surge of increased civic responsibility of each person in this tourist country and is rippling 
<br/>across every local society, community, cutting across every divide bringing about a sense of responsibility 
<br/>of helping others along.  The shift Mr. Speaker, Sir, will strengthen and empower university students who 
<br/>are citizens and as beneficiary of this policy they become an investment in the human capital of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a world where competition is getting stiff, it must be recognised 
<br/>that every individual irrespective of race, gender, nationality, ethnic or social origin, religion or political 
<br/>preference, aged or disability is entitled to free academic tuition for tertiary education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits are many, for the economic benefits nationally that is economic 
<br/>growth, poverty reduction, sustained economic growth, shift of knowledge-based economy, research and 
<br/>innovation systems, foreign direct investment, employee productivity, increased tax revenues, increased 
<br/>consumption, increased labour flexibility entrepreneurship individually, better jobs with higher salaries 
<br/>and benefits such as pensions, higher saving levels, better working conditions, improved job satisfaction, 
<br/>professional  mobility,  reduced  reliance  on  financial  support  from  government  and  increased  career 
<br/>prospects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Socio-political  benefits,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  nationally  reduced  crime,  increased  community 
<br/>engagement, improved civil society, social cohesion, increased open mindedness and tolerance, building 
<br/>and maintaining democratic values, improved ability for social change, building distinct national identity 
<br/>and globally connected identities, shift to a knowledge based society, informed criticisms debate and 
<br/>dialogue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Individually  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  improved  health  and  life  expectancy,  improved  quality  of  life, 
<br/>enhanced opportunity for social mobility, better decision making, improved social status improves leisure 
<br/>time, development authentically of individual capabilities and potential, problem solving based on recent 
<br/>arguments and discourse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  academic  and  educational  benefits  nationally  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  more  better  qualified 
<br/>teachers for the education system, more avenues for research in the education system, more international 
<br/>in outlook, ability to survive the challenges of globalisation.  Individually Mr. Speaker, Sir, building up 
<br/>the total person, opportunism of life learning and fulfilment overall and destiny in society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA offers free academic tuition for tertiary studies to school leavers and 
<br/></span><span>other qualified Fiji citizens.  While this policy is generally for Fiji citizens, a specific target group - our 
<br/></span><span>young Fijians school-leavers and other qualified citizens who have met the necessary requirements to 
<br/>be admitted into any Technical Vocational Education and Training and Higher Education Programme 
<br/>offered by any of these tertiary institutions, the:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cost, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is $200 million. We have the sums, we know where to get it from 
<br/>and as I have highlighted in my speech during the Budget Debate, I have highlighted a number of tax 
<br/>initiatives that have been neglected by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our problem is that, tax cuts in this country are being funded by debts.  We 
<br/>give tax cuts to the wealthy and what do we do, we go out, borrow and burden the </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span> of 
<br/>this country.  The honourable Minister today spoke about costings of our budget and saying that it is 
<br/>normal in any democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for what we know, when a county demands that of its political parties, they 
<br/>would set up an agency to help the political parties cost the manifesto.  We are doing it on our own, 
<br/>you are not helping us in costing our manifesto.  If you want to do this, set up an agency so that it 
<br/>can be a fair go for everyone to have access to those resources.  As it is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our team 
<br/>have  come  up  with  free  tertiary  at  $200  million  and  that  is  on  top  of  what  you  already  spent  on 
<br/>education Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have highlighted here the number of tax initiatives that you 
<br/>have neglected because you pander to the wealthy (the business people) and you are denying services 
<br/>to our people, the </span><span>lewe ni vanua</span><span> and how do you do it?  Your tax cut is being funded by borrowing, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Stop dreaming!  It won’t happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  love this - you know what I have seen develop 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over the last couple of days - that the hit man now from FijiFirst is honourable Selai Adimaitoga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It is amazing that everyone else is mute, I just love the lady - she is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now the front hit person from the other side of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  courses  benefiting  from  this  policy  are  certificates  at  all  levels  - 
<br/></span><span>Preliminary courses, Foundation courses, Trade Diplomas, Diplomas and Bachelor Degree. These 
<br/></span><span>are included in the SODELPA Free Tertiary Initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  immediately  from  Government  this  will  happen.    We  know  that  other 
<br/>countries  do  this,  we  know  that  Sri  Lanka  and  Barbados  do  this  and  in  Germany,  all  the  State 
<br/>universities provide free tuition to their people and you know Germany is the power house of Europe 
<br/>the economy.  Fiji will become the power house of the Pacific when SODELPA is in power and free 
<br/>tertiary education is available to everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on TELS, we will forgive the TELS debts and forgiveness of student debts 
<br/></span><span>would bring much needed relief to many, especially because many people may also be struggling with 
<br/>loss of income, food and housing, insecurity and a disruptive education due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
<br/>and economic recession.  Forgiveness of student debts would advance gender and racial equity since 
<br/>studies have shown that burden of student debt is not born equally.  Forgiveness of student debt is good 
<br/></span><span>for the economy and cancelling student debt would also have a powerful stimulus effect on the economy, 
<br/></span><span>which will be critical as we look to build a sustainable economic recovery.  Forgiveness of student debts

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak President Biden has introduced initiatives to forgive student loan 
<br/>in the United States.  It is now into more than $1trillion.  He is getting a lot of flak from the US and from 
<br/>the Opposition but the general  youth population in the US are welcoming this initiative by President 
<br/>Biden, and the youths of this country will know that SODELPA will forgive their debts.  Today, the last 
<br/>we read is that the TELS loan is about $571million - we should stop it now and that is why SODELPA 
<br/>wants to do this.  You let it go, it can become like in the USA, which has exceeded $1 trillion.  The time 
<br/>to do it is now, the time for change is now and the time for change is coming through SODELPA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  did  not  know  that  this  was  the  time  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>manifesto reading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise to speak on the motion by honourable Pillay.  Firstly, I would like to commend the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Higher Education Commission for providing this report to Parliament for review and discussion.  This is 
<br/>a Government that invests and believes in education like none other.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As the authority on higher education in Fiji, the FHEC oversees the compliance, registration and 
<br/>curriculum review of all higher education institutions to ensure that they are properly accredited to offer 
<br/>study opportunities that are recognised and respected in Fiji and around the world.  All higher education 
<br/>award conferring institutions are required by law to be registered with the Commission in order to legally 
<br/>operate and be an accredited higher education institution.  Over 50 institutions fall under the present 
<br/>purview of the Commission including leading tertiary institutions such as FNU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this report covers the period from 2016 to 2017, which saw the development of 
<br/>18 national qualifications with five higher education institutions awarded recognition rights, four newly 
<br/>registered and three re-registered.  We count on quality standards across our education system to provide 
<br/>the services that the public can rely on and that private sector employers can trust.  Just to give one 
<br/>example,  this  month  the  Fiji  Police  Academy  received  its  Certificate  of  Registration  from  the 
<br/>Commission, which upholds the quality assurance of the training and resulting services that graduating 
<br/>police officers can offer the country.  High value industries such as those in the mining sector are also 
<br/></span><span>recognising the benefit of having suitable, qualified and skilled workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the assistance of the Commission, the Vatukoula Gold Mine is in the 
<br/>process  of  establishing  the  Vatukoula  Gold  Mine  Technical  Institution,  which  will  give  Fijians  the 
<br/>opportunity  to  develop  skills  and  receive  technical  education  to  make  them  more  enjoyable  in  the 
<br/>industry.  There are real grass root level ways that this Commission is making a daily difference for Fiji.  
<br/>We are also getting Nadave to be accredited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these are the types of initiatives that are being developed to synergise higher learning 
<br/>and the practical understanding of skills and knowledge, equally important is our ability to address the 
<br/>skills gap.  This is the priority of my Government and it is demonstrated through the $1.2 billion allocation 
<br/>directed to the TSLS since the inception of the initiative.  This year alone a total of 9,200 scholarships 
<br/>and loans will be awarded with a total allocation of $162.6 million.  The number of awards under the 
<br/>National  Toppers  Local  Scheme  will  increase  from  547  to  770  with  40  awards  for  MBBS,  five  for 
<br/>Bachelor of Dental Surgery and 40 for nursing.  Teachers will also be able to apply for 165 scholarships 
<br/>for  training  in  maths  and  physics,  industrial  arts,  primary  education  and  computer  science  while  20

<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>scholarships  are  available  for  students  with  special  needs,  the  National  Toppers  Overseas  Scheme  is 
<br/>reinstated with 40 awards on offer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  my  Government  would  not  be  able  to  offer  such  scholarships  and  educational 
<br/>assistance  without  a  credible  and  quality  standard  Fijian  higher  education  system  at  our  backs.    Our 
<br/>consistent and visionary investment in the sector has made that reality.  Fiji’s future is knowledge-based.  
<br/>Knowledge and expertise that will drive our economy forward while protecting the socioeconomic rights 
<br/>of Fijians.  The role of the Commission helps ensure that we focus on high value learning and that our 
<br/>higher educational Fijian institutions are on par with the best in the world.  Based on these remarks, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, I support the motion before the House.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief.    Unfortunately  I  am 
<br/>compelled to add further to what the honourable Minister for Education mentioned about USP because 
<br/>the honourable Professor Prasad has opened up the door on that particular subject matter which is actually 
<br/>frankly not directly related to what we are discussing today, which is on the motion by honourable Pillay.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  just  in  respect  of  the  HEC,  it  is  not  only  about  accrediting  institutions,  it  is  also  about 
<br/>pedagogical methodologies.  In other words, teaching methodologies to be up to time with how teaching 
<br/></span><span>methodologies change over a period of time, the type of teaching that takes place, and the people actually 
<br/></span><span>who do the teaching.  Also, we need to have higher education institutions that need to be responsive to 
<br/>the labour market needs because as honourable Gavoka, who in his quest to get the votes of young Fijians, 
<br/>is offering to make university all free without any ring-fencing around it.  In other words we could have 
<br/>a glut of people who may go off and study a particular subject, may all go off and become accountants or 
<br/>economists but at the end of it, there is no jobs for them.  So, what is the point of the level of investment 
<br/>and for them to waste their time?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Come on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is saying, “come on”, but in fact that is what has happened 
<br/>in the market.  We had at one point in time, Sir, a glut of people who did accounting and then they could 
<br/>not find jobs.  Honourable Professor Prasad would know this, and there are many other areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Toppers and the way it is being awarded, it has been based 
<br/>essentially on the labour requirements, the needs that we have.  We have a shortage for example of marine 
<br/>scientists, of foresters, at one point in time shortage of nurses - in fact now there is a shortage of nurses.  
<br/>The professional preference changes in countries like Australia and New Zealand.  We have teachers for 
<br/></span><span>example who want to do, what we call the run-of-the-mill type of teaching but not many in maths and 
<br/></span><span>physics as the honourable Prime Minister highlighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got more scholarships for people who want to learn in those areas, who want to get 
<br/>qualifications because there is a shortage of people in those areas.   I think Mr. Speaker, Sir, and again he 
<br/>said you know $200 million - already this year we are allocating $160 million with 9,000 awards, so $200 
<br/>million is way off the mark if he was going to make university completely free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that we wanted to also make was the identification of the skills 
<br/>shortage areas and oversupply in the job market as I mentioned, but also there is a pivoting in respect of 
<br/>what people may call ‘blue collar qualification’ or what we call ‘the micro qualifications’.  Honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad in that respect talked about USP Pacific Technical and Further Education or Pacific 
<br/>TAFE and I am going to brief on this, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2012, USP launched its strategic plan to have TVET Provisions in 2013 to 2018.  During this 
<br/>Strategic Plan consultation and in the implementation, USP continuously assured member countries that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2081 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>TVET offerings will be done purely on “self-funding” model and Dr. Reddy who was also Minister for 
<br/>Education can vouch for that, he was a member of the USP Council then and of course As I have said he 
<br/>can vouch for it.  This means the TVET qualification through Pacific TAFE will be offered not by using 
<br/>member country funding or member state funded resources but operate on commercial basis by getting 
<br/>income from individual fee paying students.  There are other self-funding sections that operate with this 
<br/>model within USP such as the Graduate School of Business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  TSLS  was  established  now  the  Tertiary  Education  Loan  Scheme  (TELS),  TVET 
<br/>Programmes at USP were not given scholarships and student loans but were allowed later on.  No other 
<br/>member country has extensively funded USP’s TVET Programmes through scholarships and student 
<br/>loans,  or  study  loans.  In  the  2018-2019  Budget  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  decision  not  to  fund  TVET 
<br/>Programmes at USP was made with two rationales.  Firstly, programmes were not part of the TVET 
<br/>priority areas such as Carpentry, Joinery, Panel Beating, Welding and Fabrication, Mining, Surveying et 
<br/>cetera.  USP TVET Programmes are in Business Administration, Human Resources, IT and other areas 
<br/>which can be best addressed through Degree Programmes.  The Pacific TAFE has more professional 
<br/>certificates and diploma Programmes targeting working people who can pay themselves or development 
<br/>partners can support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  absolutely,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  clear  pathway  and  articulation  of  USP  TVET 
<br/></span><span>Programmes into the Degree Programme. For example if you had a Diploma in Human Resources at 
<br/>Pacific  TAFE  which  consist  of  13  courses  or  units  there  is  no  block  credit  transfer  into  the  Degree 
<br/>Programme in  Human Resources  (Industrial Relation)  in  USP.  That means  you  can  do 13 Diploma 
<br/>courses and other 24 courses for Degree at the same university.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The USP needs to look across TVET pathway as considered by Australian universities and indeed 
<br/>that is precisely what FNU is doing. We have been working with the Ministry of Education where some 
<br/>of the schools still have those TVET based courses where you can have Modules 1, 2, 3 and Module 4 
<br/>and you can actually roll all those modules and ultimately end up doing Diplomas, et cetera, and you get 
<br/>cross-credits.  Pacific TAFE does not give you cross-credits, basically, that is why we stopped funding it.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is obviously the USP Management has hidden the rationalities in the New Student 
<br/>Association Executive as a messenger in this politics and nothing else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to also make, the honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/>stood there and did this defence of Mr. Ahluwalia.  We have on the floor of this Chamber on a number 
<br/>of occasions stated our position.  I have got a two-three pages brief on this and I really do not want to 
<br/>read it and the fact is that the honourable Minister for Education has very clearly said that there has been 
<br/></span><span>no independent assessments carried out about the allegations regarding Mr. Ahluwalia and what is there 
<br/></span><span>to fear?  Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there is an independent investigation being called for, what fear is there to have that carried 
<br/>out?    And  the  Minister  for  Education  is  absolutely  right  -  the  BDO  Report  is  no  vindication  of  Mr. 
<br/>Ahluwalia, none of  their  reports  are  a vindication  of Mr. Ahluwalia and they  all know that.   It  is so 
<br/>unfortunate that honourable Professor Prasad has used the floor to go down this path again, when here 
<br/>we are talking about the Higher Education Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this and I really do not want to read this because it is quite boring 
<br/>actually.  Honourable Gavoka talked about how we can arrive with these figures, we should setup an 
<br/>agency.  Since 2014, we have invited every single year the Opposition to come to the budget consultation 
<br/>(presentation of draft budget).  After 2014 they came only once, after that they all disappeared, this time 
<br/>around  a  few  of  them  turned  up,  honourable  Rasova,  honourable  Bulanauca,  honourable  Leawere, 
<br/>honourable Vosanibola and honourable Seniloli.  They turned up, unfortunately their contribution was 
<br/>not that great even though they came to the Budget consultation.

<div><span>Review Report - FHEC August 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have failed continuously to come and honourable Gavoka sits 
<br/>there belligerently shaking his head when we have opened our arms and opened the doors to say, “come 
<br/>and try and understand.” You will understand how we get revenue. How much money we get from 
<br/>corporate tax.  How much money we get from PAYE. How much money we get from VAT, departure 
<br/>tax but they sit here not reading the material and just complaining about the fact they do not have 
<br/>access to information.  The fiscal update has been presented on a number of occasions, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make is this flippant comment about 
<br/>we are pandering to the rich. Every time, Sir, on the floor of this Parliament when the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister has launched various policies, when we have talked about giving targeted assistance, 
<br/>they call it freebies.  We subsidised electricity for those households that earns less than $30,000 a 
<br/>year.   We subsidised water for those people who earn less than $30,000  a  year.  This  is  the first 
<br/>Government  that  is  giving  free  medicine.  This  is  the  first  Government  giving  access  to  Private 
<br/>General Practitioners. This is the first Government giving scholarships, TELS the way it is giving. 
<br/>We have inflation mitigation, a dollar a day per child and they ridiculed it. They are collecting $180 
<br/>in  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  doing  the  pay-out  for  the  After  Care  Fund  and  the  Government 
<br/>Pensions on 31</span><span>st </span><span>August.  Next week all Social Welfare Recipients are getting their $180.  We already 
<br/>have 91,000 parents who have applied for their children for their $180 and they say we are pandering 
<br/></span><span>to the rich.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the level of amount of electricity and water connectivity to rural, poor areas, 
<br/>isolated areas, maritime areas, standalone systems, these are people on the margins of society  yet 
<br/>they are saying we are pandering to the rich.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- How can that be? This logically does not make sense.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Dr.  Naulumatua  will  tell  us  when  companies  have  to  pay 
<br/>corporate tax rate at a rate that is applicable for everyone to digest, everyone will pay their corporate 
<br/>tax rate, they do not  keep double books. She knows that. As a result of  that, honourable Gavoka 
<br/>bothered to even read the material as opposed to just parroting what people put in front of him, he 
<br/>would know that corporate tax collection in this country has improved significantly.  Today, when 
<br/>we are saying about the reporting of $5,000 and above, they berate it. We are trying to stop the black 
<br/>economy yet they actually want to assist it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It was very interesting and I will finish off, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad used the word “stupid” a lot and honourable Gavoka sort of chimed in 
<br/>with him too. It kind of reminded me of one of my favourite British philosophers, Bertrand Russell 
<br/>who said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A stupid man’s report of what a clever man says can never be accurate, because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he unconsciously translates what he hears into something he can understand.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I give the floor to the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have any further comments to make. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.
