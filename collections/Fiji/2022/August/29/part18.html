<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI PORTS CORPORATION LIMITED  
<br/>2018 AND 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited  2018  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019 Annual Report which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Ports Corporation Limited (FPCL) is a commercial 
<br/>maritime port management company that operates the two main ports of entry in Fiji – King’s Wharf and 
<br/>Queen’s Wharf.  In particular, FPCL is responsible for: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local wharves, as it owns and operates the two major ports of Suva and Lautoka and 
<br/>secondary ports of Levuka, Vuda, Malau, Wairiki and Rotuma; 
<br/>Property; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Wharf infrastructure, development and maintenance; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Marine services - tugs, line boats, pilot boats; and  
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land based services - warehousing, container yard planning and berthing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of its plans to rehabilitate our ports and wharves, FPCL intends to develop the Lautoka 
<br/>and Levuka ports and review regulatory requirements and responsibilities for declared and non-declared 
<br/>ports and wharves in line with its 5-Year Strategic Plan (2019-2023). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that dividend totalling more than $16 million was paid to FPCL shareholders for the 
<br/>2019  financial  year.    This  year  also  saw  the  launch  of  2019-2020  Green  Port  Master  plan  and 
<br/>Sustainability Guideline Procurement together with FPCL’s 5-Year Strategic Plan (2019-2023). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  major  achievement  of  FPCL  was  the  achievement  of  ISO  9001:  2015  Certificate  in 
<br/>Quality Management System for Ports of Suva and Lautoka.  This certificate focuses on reducing risk 
<br/>and  enhancing  opportunity  within  the  organisation,  enabling  staff  to  make  contribution  towards 
<br/></span><span>continuous improvement and meeting stakeholders and customer expectations.  The attainment of this 
<br/></span><span>certificate  highlights  FPCL’s  full  commitment  for  the  improvement  of  their  internal  processes  and 
<br/>activities.  Generally, the Committee is satisfied with the operations of FPCL for the years 2018 to 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Fiji Ports Corporation 
<br/>Limited  Annual  Report  before  us.    I  note  in  the  Committee  Report  the  various  recommendations 
<br/>particularly on the strategic plan, feasibility study and also there is one on Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries 
<br/>Limited regarding coordination.  But I find it disappointing that there are some issues which have not 
<br/>been raised, for example, the issue about derelict ships which affects the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>around Suvavou and 
<br/></span><span>Navukavu and also pollution.  Particularly there is nothing mentioned here on the landowners and the 
<br/></span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners, so that is an issue I would like to raise in terms of Fiji Ports Corporation Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to share excerpts from a report by a surveyor land consultant which had been done 
<br/>some years back.  This talks about, not only Suva but also applies to the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>areas of the Tui Vitogo</span><span>
<br/></span><span>regarding the Lautoka Port.  Going back in terms of the creation of the statutory authority to control Suva 
<br/></span><span>Harbour, the Ports Authority was created under Ports Authority Act going back and its states, granting
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FPCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the authority, the power to declare ports and ports approaches to be under their control anywhere in Fiji.  
<br/>The harbour of Suva is now under their (statutory power) control.  The control of the Suva Harbour by 
<br/>the indigenous people of Suva as </span><span>taukei ni baravi kei na toba kei Suva </span><span>has been taken out of their hands 
<br/>and placed upon the control of the statutory authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  necessary  and  the  Suva  people  have  come  to  appreciate  and  understand  the  needs  to 
<br/>transfer control of the harbour and its approach to the Ports Authority.  Being an international port 
<br/>of the country and the most important national sea port of Fiji has to be strictly in control in order to 
<br/>achieve high level of efficiency and to prevent serious mishap in the harbour and the wharf.   Tui</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Suva and his people have recognised the necessity to transfer such control of the harbour of Suva to 
<br/>the Ports Authority of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  mentioned  that  whilst  the  indigenous  people  of  Suva  have  recognised  and 
<br/>appreciated the reason for the shift of control of the harbour and fully accepting it, there is a need to 
<br/>pay compensation by way of annuity by the Ports of Authority to Tui Suva and his three </span><span>yavusa.  </span><span>The 
<br/>submission was made in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and concept of fair play 
<br/>that indigenous people of Suva shall be paid a fair annual compensation by way of annuity, a sum of 
<br/>suggested equal to 10 percent of gross shipping levies of Suva Port and Harbour, equal to 3 percent 
<br/></span><span>of gross cargo levies of Suva Port and Harbour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  the  reclamation  of  Suva  Harbour  and  its  construction  in  the  1960s,  the  indigenous 
<br/>people of Suva have never received any compensation for this reclamation and constructional work 
<br/>particularly the construction of the wharf area.  The authorities, realising good revenue both from the 
<br/>ship and cargo levies and it is universally accepted that  when a person is realising revenues from 
<br/>another’s  resources,  it  is  only  fair  and  proper  that  he  pays  certain  sums  such  as  rents,  charges, 
<br/>annuities or compensation to that other person which is the owner of the resources. The proposed 
<br/>annuities, in our opinion, is fair and reasonable bearing in mind that Ports is enjoying total control of 
<br/>the harbour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other related issue is fishing rights.  The people of Suva owns the fishing rights over the 
<br/>harbour of Suva between a straight line from the mouth of Lami River to a point in the middle of 
<br/>Suva Passage; another straight line from the mouth  of Samabula River to the centre of Nukubuca 
<br/>Passage.  It is bounded on the north by a coastal line from the South to the edge of the reef on the 
<br/>ocean side.  It is clear that the fishing rights for the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Suva is intact and the boundary clearly 
<br/>demarcated by the Native Land and Fisheries Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On pollution, it is stated that we know from the technical report of the USP at that time that 
<br/></span><span>the Suva Harbour is polluted from organic waste, sewage pollution and other chemical pollutants 
<br/>which have extended to the reef and has killed off the coral.  Primarily, the waste have been allowed 
<br/>to escape into Suva Harbour either from residential properties, commercial or industrial properties. 
<br/>The control of the waste disposal from the properties in the city into the drains, brooks, et cetera goes 
<br/>into the harbour.  The Ports Authority, as indicated, will not tolerate deliberate pollution but this is 
<br/>ongoing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, these were some of the issues raised.  In their conclusion, they have stated that in their 
<br/>opinion of the consultant, the Government and the Council is jointly responsible for the pollution of 
<br/>the fishing area of the indigenous people of Fiji.  It would, therefore, be a policy decision whether to 
<br/>pay  compensation  to  the  indigenous  people  of  Suva  or  not.  The  owners  of  the  resources,  the 
<br/>indigenous people must be properly compensated by individuals or authorities or the State.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the issues, I thought, I would raise in relation to this report which is not 
<br/>clearly mentioned but which is despite the age of this report is still relevant today.  I am raising it 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FPCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2085 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here so that it is pursued, it is noted by the Government of the day and whoever comes in as the 
<br/>Government  of  the  day  to  please  consider  this  issue  as  we  deal,  not  only  the  Suva  Port  but  also 
<br/>Lautoka, the </span><span>Qoliqoli</span><span> of the </span><span>Turaga Tui</span><span> Vitogo and other ports facilities as such around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly, we ask the question sometime back to 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Fisheries as to the reason why fishing vessels are no longer coming to Suva 
<br/>as in the past. We were told by the honourable Minister that it was cheaper to go back to the home base 
<br/>to carry out repairs, replenishment and the like. We have stated that we will bring back all these fishing 
<br/>vessels to Suva because they contribute a lot to the economy of the city.  We have been told from other 
<br/>sources that Suva is just costing itself out of contention.  It is too costly to come to Suva, it is easier to go 
<br/>to Pago Pago and other ports in the Pacific.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would hope that the Corporation relook 
<br/>at this and bring back those fishing vessels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to our people and some of them are ex-fisheries people, there used to be in excess of 
<br/>300 fishing vessels per year visiting Suva, and if they stay for three days, they used to clean up Suva 
<br/>Market, according to those who worked in the fisheries department.  So it is very important for Suva, and 
<br/>I am particularly thinking about our farmers that the produce they bring, for them one of the huge markets 
<br/>will be the fishing vessels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So I would just urge the Corporation to try and relook at the situation and bring back those fishing 
<br/>vessels.  Suva used to be very popular with those types of vessels and we would like to see them back.  
<br/>Certainly we will do it as a government to bring back those vessels but we need to relook at this very 
<br/>seriously.  We notice that the Corporation is making a lot of money, paying a lot of bonuses, but Suva 
<br/>should not be pricing itself out of the region.  I just wish that the Corporation would look into that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  very  quickly,  since  the  divestment  of 
<br/>shares in Fiji Ports Corporation Limited and the modernisation of it, I hope honourable Members are also 
<br/>aware that we have two companies that operate at the Port, one is Fiji Ports Corporation Limited and the 
<br/>other one is Fiji Ports Terminal Limited.  Fiji Ports Terminal Limited is more the stevedoring side of 
<br/>things.  We were there last week on Friday at the Fiji Ports Terminal function where the staff are actually 
<br/>paid under Performance Management System (PMS) a large amount of payout and a few weeks prior to 
<br/>that  was  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited.    Again,  the  staff  were  given  a  large  payout  under  PMS.  
<br/>Honourable Tuisawau, of course, does not care about things like that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited  only  a  few  years  ago,  because  of  the 
<br/>inefficiencies at the Port, each shipping company used to charge per container a levy because they used 
<br/></span><span>to berth much longer, spend a lot more fuel in terms of burning fuel to get things loaded or offloaded.  
<br/></span><span>Today, of course, the levy is gone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is really interesting, Sir, last week we found out that the trans-shipment has increased by 29 
<br/>percent at the Fijian ports at Suva and Lautoka.  In other words, shipping companies are using Fiji now 
<br/>more for trans-shipment purposes also, and the only reason why international shipping companies would 
<br/>use a port for trans-shipment is because of the greater efficiencies.  We have seen that growth and we 
<br/>hope to increase that even further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Ports  Terminal  is  investing  in  much  more  new  technologies,  they  are  spending  about  $4 
<br/>million to $5 million.  Fiji Ports Terminal have an amazing technology and I would urge Committee 
<br/>Members to get an opportunity to go and see the navigational aids they have, the amount of security they 
<br/>have, the high resolution technology they have to be able to monitor what is actually happening in the 
<br/>ports all the way down Lami with the high powerful cameras that they are using.  It is really quite amazing 
<br/>in terms of what they have done.

<div><span>Review Report – FPCL 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from Government’s perspective, of course, we have been looking at expanding 
<br/>the Port or finding an alternative site.  As highlighted in Parliament previously, we have been talking to 
<br/>the ADB now for a couple of years, to look at expanding the Port where we have a one-stop-shop.  Some 
<br/>honourable Members may remember and I do not know if they can remember that far back but honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad should know this because this happened when Rabuka was the Prime Minister under 
<br/>the SVT Government.  There was this sort of flurry of activity to divest shares when they sold P &amp; T and 
<br/>listed the company, got FNPF to pay large sums of money per share just so they could get more revenue 
<br/>and then immediately after the sale, the share price dropped significantly with huge losses to FNPF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, within that, they also sold off Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited to a $2 
<br/>New Zealand company.  That $2 NZ company bought the share, they sold it to them and then, of course, 
<br/>they could not run it.  Then government went back and bought Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, you have the slipway, you have 300 tonnes, 500 tonnes and you have 
<br/>a thousand tonnes.  If you go down to Walu Bay, you can actually see it.  A couple of them are not fully 
<br/>operational but the point is that, we are looking for alternative sites where we can have all the cargo 
<br/>containers, we can have all the fishing vessels but we can also provide, Sir, in terms of ship repair work.  
<br/>You need to have the capacity to do that.  Ship repair work and also ship building too and Fiji was quite 
<br/></span><span>good at that.  Unfortunately, during the SVT Government days, we lost that edge.  So, Sir, since we have 
<br/></span><span>been sort of trying to rejuvenate Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, Fiji Ship and Heavy Industries Ltd is 
<br/>now a part of that.  It is a subsidiary of that.  So, there is a lot of things that are being done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are talking to ADB to look at alternative sites and see where we can have the port facilities.  
<br/>If honourable Tuisawau sort of got his head out of what he is always stuck in, would know that part of 
<br/>the port cannot actually be used because it cannot carry very heavy loads.  If you see the container ships, 
<br/>they will always be at the northern end of the port because of the fact that this part of the port, the southern 
<br/>part of the port needs enormous amounts, millions and millions of dollars of investment to be able to 
<br/>carry the loads that it should be able to.  So, this is why we find cruise liners actually are up at the southern 
<br/>end of the port.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a number of challenges and notwithstanding that, Sir, and the archaic investment, the 
<br/>assets that were there, Fiji Ports Corporation Limited continues to make profit, continues to pay dividends 
<br/>to its shareholders which now includes of course, FNPF, the Fijian Government and Aitken Spence which 
<br/>has a shareholding of only about 20 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, from a Government’s strategic perspective, 
<br/>we are looking at alternative sites, we are looking at PPP model as to how we can work with Fiji Ports 
<br/>Corporation Ltd to augment the areas in which we can grow the port facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a maritime nation, we should be able to then get better returns and of course, provide a lot 
<br/>more jobs for our citizens.  Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for the report and also, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the shareholders at Fiji Ports Corporation Limited 
<br/>and all those very hardworking staff at FPCL, who actually have really brought this organisation into the 
<br/>21st Century.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments to make.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members.  Parliament will now vote to note the content 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Report.

<div><span>Question put.
