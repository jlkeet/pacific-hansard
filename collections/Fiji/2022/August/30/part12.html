<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>RESERVE BANK OF FIJI 2018-2021 ANNUAL REPORT  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of Reserve Bank of Fiji 2018-2019, 
<br/>2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 6th April, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled the 
<br/>Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji    2018-2019,  2019-2020  and  2020-2021 
<br/>Annual Reports in April 2022.  While the 2018-2019 period was business as usual for the Reserve 
<br/>Bank of Fiji (RBF), the year 2020 brought its own unique challenges due to various factors, one of 
<br/>which was the trade tension between USA and China during the first-half of the financial year and 
<br/>the other, as we all are aware, Fiji being hit by COVID-19 during the second-half.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like many other countries, Fiji too had to face the brunt of the pandemic as global economic 
<br/>activity had duelled significantly.  Proactive measures were taken by the Fijian Government to avoid 
<br/>the outbreak and our borders closing around the globe.  The number of inbound tourists dramatically 
<br/>dropped which led to the negative economic ramification in the country.  The Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>was  very  efficient  in  introducing  various  policies  during  the  2019-2020  and  2020-2021  period  to 
<br/>mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 and commended the bank for its swift action.  This was 
<br/>commended by the Committee as the role of RBF was very crucial and its timely effort in dealing 
<br/>with the repercussion of the pandemic was appreciated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the shift towards digital method of transactions which was triggered by 
<br/>COVID-19  restrictions  with  more  people  using  services  such  as  M-PAiSA  and  internet  banking.  
<br/>People  living  abroad  use  mobile  money  services  to  send  money  to  relatives  living  in  Fiji,  which 
<br/>contribute  to  the  significant  increase  in  remittance.    While  the  Committee  appreciates  the  shift 
<br/>towards cashless transactions, it was also recommended for RBF to continue working with the key 
<br/>stakeholders such as Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit (FFIU) to strengthen the cybercrime capabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The havoc caused by COVID-19 pandemic was also an opportunity to explore other prospects 
<br/>one being the huge potential of business process outsourcing and many benefits Fiji can gain with 
<br/></span><span>more  international  business  outsourcing  their  services  to  Fiji.    The  Committee  commended  the 
<br/></span><span>overall performance of RBF during the period under review especially given the various challenges 
<br/>due to the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  understands  that  a  lot  of  work  and  effort  will  go  towards  Fiji’s  economic 
<br/>recovery and that RBF will play a crucial role through the various policies.  With these few words 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I open the floor for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker Sir, before I speak on the motion and the Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>itself, I want to pay tribute to Justice Jai Ram Reddy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it is with deep sorrow that we have learned of the death in Auckland last 
<br/>night of Justice Jai Ram Reddy who twice led the National Federation Party between 1977 and 1999 
<br/>and served as Fiji’s longest serving leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Reddy was 85 years old, an accomplished lawyer and brilliant public speaker.  Justice 
<br/></span><span>Reddy was the acknowledged leader of Fiji’s Indo-Fijian community during its most difficult and 
<br/></span><span>challenging period after independence.  His pursuit of reconciliation and tolerance with Mr. Sitiveni 
<br/>Rabuka in the post 1987 coup period led to the ground breaking 1997 Constitution cementing him 
<br/>into Fiji’s history as one of our most important national leaders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice Jai Ram Reddy’s, Mr. Speaker, electoral partnership with Mr. Sitiveni Rabuka in 1999 
<br/>was unsuccessful - rejected by the voters.  He then embarked on his next career as a Judge: first as 
<br/>President of the Fiji Court of Appeal and later as a member of the International Criminal Tribunal 
<br/>for Rwanda sitting in judgement on the horrors of the genocide that had taken place in that country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice Jai Ram Reddy was a man of his times but also one who understood and influenced 
<br/>history.  From his earliest time in politics he understood the importance of deep understanding and 
<br/>cooperation between Fiji’s two main ethnic communities.  He fought hard for his NFP constituency, 
<br/>farmers, workers and the Indo-Fijian community but always with an eye on the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice Jai Ram Reddy understood that the security of Indo-Fijians lay in a deeper and more 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2121 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meaningful relationship with Fiji’s indigenous people.  He worked all his political career to pursue it 
<br/>often in times of division and misunderstanding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice  Jai  Ram  Reddy  was  the  Attorney-General  in  Dr.  Timoci  Bavadra’s  short  lived 
<br/>government in 1987 driven from office by the military.  He fought passionately to protect those who 
<br/>suffered  from  the  </span><span>coup</span><span>  and  its  aftermath.    He  reluctantly  returned  to  politics  in  the  1992-1994 
<br/>Elections but always with the view to bridge building and reconciliation.  His engagement with Prime 
<br/>Minister Rabuka in that period laid the foundations for a deepening of democracy and cooperation 
<br/>between people of all races and faiths in our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he was the first Indo-Fijian leader to address the Great Council of Chiefs at 
<br/>Mr. Rabuka’s invitation.  He travelled with Mr. Rabuka to the Commonwealth Heads of Government 
<br/>Meeting in London in 1997 where Mr. Rabuka invited him to speak for Fiji in Mr. Rabuka’s place, 
<br/>while many around, he nursed the 1987 grievances.  Justice Reddy understood that it was necessary 
<br/>to move forward always remembering the past and the lessons it could teach us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 1999 political partnership between NFP and SVT did not resonate with voters.  They lost 
<br/>that election.  The reasons for this are now a part of our history but this was the lost opportunity and 
<br/></span><span>event that led to the 2000 </span><span>coup</span><span> and its consequences.  Fiji still feel these consequences today.  It was 
<br/></span><span>at that point that Mr. Jai Ram Reddy as he then was decided that he had served his time in history 
<br/>and chose to return to the law this time as a judge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice Jai Ram Reddy, Mr. Speaker, is a towering figure in Fiji’s history. Like NFP’s founder 
<br/>leader  Mr.  Ambalal  Dahyabhai  Patel  and  Mr.  Siddiq  Moidin  Koya  it  is  remarkable  that  he  is 
<br/>remembered for his time in Opposition not in Government.  In that way he proved the importance of 
<br/>leadership  and  vision  over  the  narrow  objects  of  political  contests.    He  had  a  vision  for  the  next 
<br/>generation not for the next election.  He was deeply committed to democracy, the rule of law and the 
<br/>politics of dialogue and cooperation.  Because of his leadership NFP moved with the times become 
<br/>a party  with  the national  outlook, increasing his  representation  in  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community and his 
<br/>advocacy of issues important to Fiji’s people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Justice Jai Ram Reddy’s life is a reminder of what politics and leadership in Fiji should be.  
<br/>We, in the NFP, are committed to the vision he stood for and to bring back the values he always 
<br/>fought  for.    We  want  his  work  and  sacrifice  for  others  to  be  meaningful  and  to  bear  fruit  in  a 
<br/>generation of leadership.  May his soul rest in eternal peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Let me talk on the Report itself.  
<br/>This is a very significant Report because it deals with the Years 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-
<br/>2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  period  in  which  we  can  reflect  on  Government’s  economic 
<br/>performance.    If  you  look  at  the  2018-2019  Budget;  pre-Elections  budget  some  of  the  policies 
<br/>whether it was the tax policy or the expenditure policy, the Government went berserk, and they went 
<br/>on  a  spending  spree  before  the  Elections.    Essentially,  it  was  reckless  vote  buying  budget  and 
<br/>expenditure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019 we came up with a negative growth, the country’s economy had contracted.  There 
<br/>were signs of stress within the economy, our debts were increasing then we got hit by the COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic.  When that pandemic hit us, we as a country did not have the fiscal or what we call the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>‘budgetary space’ to deal with the massive issue of loss of income through loss of employment and 
<br/>incomes generally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What stood out at that point in time in 2020 and 2021 of course is the role of the remittances.  
<br/>I have never had any of those guys sitting on the other side actually acknowledge how the remittances 
<br/>played such an important role.  They do not understand Mr. Speaker, Sir, they say a lot of things.  
<br/>They know what I meant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of “Noes”) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me come back to that point, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I know they 
<br/>do not like what I am going to say.  No one from that side in Parliament ever acknowledged the role 
<br/>of remittances in 2020 and 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, the mismanagement of the economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had put this country into a serious and deep hole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- A Point of Order!  The honourable Member has said that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have never acknowledged.  We have acknowledged so many times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So many times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- In addition this is the Government that has actually helped 
<br/>get remittances by getting Fijians overseas the Fijians that these people said are emptying the villages 
<br/>and you talk like that.  M-PAiSA: this is the Government that made it easier for our Fijians overseas 
<br/>to be able to send money back home.  I say it because I have relatives overseas who send money back 
<br/>home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This man who made the Point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I 
<br/>said before, he is the worst Minister for Health ever in this country.  Under his leadership, we have 
<br/>the worst health services in this country today Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- A Point of Order.  I can say many things about you, but I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will not lower my level to your level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The point I was making Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that our economy 
<br/>had already contracted in 2019.  The Government was in no position to deal with these massive losses 
<br/>of income through unemployment, loss of income, small businesses and so forth.  What did help us 
<br/>and I think the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) acknowledges, is the level of remittances.  In 2020, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we received about $652 million.  In 2021 it was more than $800 million, we received a 
<br/>total of about $1.5 million coupled with bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of Fiji to the tune of about 
<br/>$300 million in 2020, development partners, grants and draw down of our external loans which kept 
<br/>our foreign reserves in place, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are making is that, this Government has bragged about its so-
<br/>called Bainimarama Boom before, now they are talking about a Bula Boom but we all know, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir that we were in a difficult situation.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me point this out as 
<br/>well: I mean they made a big deal, they lied on the other side of this Parliament that I was proposing 
<br/>a salary cut for Civil Servants, they lied.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They lied, they lied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- A Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they continued to lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR.  I. WAQAINABETE.- It was on the website of NFP (You’re the Leader of the 
<br/>NFP), that NFP had proposed a 35 percent pay cut for all Civil Servants, published on your website.  
<br/>Sit down, I have not finished.  Sir, he is misleading Parliament, his Party of which he is the Leader 
<br/>proposed a 35 percent pay cut for nurses, doctors, lab technicians, front liners and I had to fight tooth 
<br/>and nail.  They were calling me to say “is this right?” I had to fight tooth and nail and messaged 
<br/>people to say he was not, that this Government will never cut their salary. He who is talking here is 
<br/>mad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know he is aggrieved by what I said and I maintain that he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the worst Health Minister in this country ever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he continues to lie and that will come out very soon.  But let me say this, 
<br/>this is a country during the crisis, where the workers of this country not only helped themselves in 
<br/>two ways: by withdrawing their FNPF but also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Servants took a pay cut 
<br/>because  they  had  a  reduction  in  their  FNPF  employer  contribution  from  10  percent  to  5  percent 
<br/>because the FNPF that the employers pay is part of the salary and part of their benefit.  If you cut 
<br/>that, you are actually … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- A Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- You sit down - liar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. … Man he has called me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a liar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Which man?  There is no man here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Minister for Health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Hey, there is no man here.  Honourable Minister for Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(do) not (call him) “man”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Minister for Health has called me a liar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just take your seat.  There is a first Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  I  just  want  to  correct  honourable  Professor  Prasad,  I 
<br/>know he is very much worried about what has happened in the past few weeks and in his own speech 
<br/>to try and defend his position.  But I like to ask him to keep it in control because by definition a ‘pay 
<br/>cut’ means your base salary which is your pay; then you have other terms and conditions that are 
<br/>attached to your base salary.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The base salary, the pay of all Civil Servants were not cut at all.  He is talking about FNPF 
<br/>contribution that is not pay, he knows that. There is actually a statutory provision that says that ‘every 
<br/>employer and employee must have a FNPF deduction’, that is not pay.  That is a FNPF contribution, 
<br/>Sir, please, do not mislead Parliament, it is not a cut inpay. I know you are trying to recover some 
<br/>grounds because you are on record for saying  “Civil Service must get a pay cut and 10 percent” was 
<br/>printed in the Fiji Times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  other  cuts  that  he  also  was  going  about  saying  ‘is  a  pay  cut’,  honourable  Gavoka 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please .… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- A Point of Order Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I am on a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Sit down.  There is a point of order being raised here.  Another one came 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up, now you want to take another one.  Just take your seat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  there  are  other  terms  and  conditions,  I  am  trying  to 
<br/>define  the  definition  of  pay.    They  are  what  we  call  rural  and  maritime  allowances  and  meal 
<br/>allowances.  They are separate to the basic pay.  There was no basic pay cut, the salaries of civil 
<br/>servants were not cut.  He is saying that because FNPF was reduced, therefore, it is a pay cut.  It is 
<br/>not a pay cut, Sir.  That is all I want to tell Parliament, so he should stop misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Professor Prasad, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, no matter how he tries to define it, the FNPF 
<br/>contribution is part of the benefits for any employee from the employer.  That, Mr. Speaker, was 
<br/>reduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- A point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your point of order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, this is the third time he has called us ‘guys’ – 
<br/>that is alright if he calls us ‘guys’.  He must take what the whole 27 of us are going to call him after 
<br/>this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I know, Mr. Speaker, their fortunes are down  – it is going 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down further, and they are struggling to remain relevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Of course, their political fortune is on the line and I can see 
<br/>the  frustration  on  their  part.    They  cannot  accept  the  fact  that  all  the  employees  of  this  country, 
<br/>including the civil servants, had their FNPF contribution reduced.  Not only they contributed to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2125 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>employers, including the biggest beneficiary which was the Government, they were saving about $4 
<br/>million as a result of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, the employees also had a reduction in their own contribution from 8 
<br/>percent to 5 percent.  So during the crisis, not only they – the civil servants were helping Government 
<br/>and other employees helping their employers, but they were also helping themselves during the crisis 
<br/>by taking a reduction from their own contribution of 8 percent.  They continue to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, it is about 6:6.  They are still contributing 2 percent out of their salary to 
<br/>themselves, and contributing 4 percent to the employers.  It will be 7 percent employee contribution 
<br/>and 7 percent employer contribution from January.  Again, Mr. Speaker, they will be taking 1 percent 
<br/>of their contribution to the FNPF in their pay and continue to subsidise the employers by another 3 
<br/>percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think no country in the world would have created a situation where employees were helping 
<br/>the employers.  This is the only country, I think, where the employees suffered a reduction in their 
<br/>FNPF  contribution  to  help  the  employers.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  need  to  understand  that,  and  no 
<br/>amount  of  lies  and  name-calling  from  the  other  side  will  take  away  the  fact  that  it  was  the  civil 
<br/></span><span>servants who helped the Government and helped themselves during the crisis.  That is a fact, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, and they cannot take that away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think it needs to be put on record.  I mean, he is laughing but 
<br/>he knows that the civil servants of this country helped the Government in the crisis.  They do not 
<br/>acknowledge that and then they lie that we, in the Opposition, wanted a pay reduction.  They kept on 
<br/>lying.  After it was clarified, it was out there in the public, they continued to lie, Mr. Speaker, and 
<br/>this is what they will do.  They will continue to lie between now and the Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  thank  all  the  employers  in  this  country  and  the  civil  servants 
<br/>because they sacrificed the most in a real difficult situation because not  only they suffered at the 
<br/>current  time,  they  will  suffer  for  years  and  years  to  come  because  their  savings,  including  their 
<br/>interest on FNPF, has been lost forever.  That is the reality and that is the result of bad economic 
<br/>management by this Government before the COVID-19 crisis, and I had pointed out that in 2019, we 
<br/></span><span>had negative growth.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  time  moves  on.    We  will  now  take  a  break  for

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.07 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  make  a    short 
<br/>contribution  to  the  debate  in  Parliament.    I  will  be  brief  and  before  that,  I  want  to  thank  the 
<br/>Committee,  especially  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  for  his  hard  work  in  providing  this  very 
<br/>comprehensive Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is fortunate that my contribution today lies with what the honourable Professor Prasad has 
<br/>just mentioned about remittance and what we have received, as reported by the Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>(RBF) and has been commended by the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs.  I just want to 
<br/>say that when people think alike, it confirms the level of intelligence  and fools normally differ.  I 
<br/>want to commend the RBF in recognising the immense benefits that remittance brings to Parliament 
<br/>and to the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, I also commend the RBF efforts to continue to work closely with the development 
<br/>partners and financial institutions to promote financial literacy and financial inclusion programmes 
<br/>in Fiji.  Such programmes provide basic financial knowledge that would help recipients to use funds 
<br/>not only for consumption purposes but also for investment.  Furthermore, the Bank has continued to 
<br/></span><span>collaborate with mobile money services providers, money exchange dealers and commercial banks 
<br/></span><span>to facilitate cheaper, easier and faster transfer of international remittance to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, based on that, the Committee has stated that it was pleased to note that there 
<br/>was a significant increase in remittance during the 2020-2021 financial year through mobile money 
<br/>services which saw a substantial increase of 283.5 percent, thus positively contributing towards the 
<br/>economy.  The RBF reported that Fiji’s total remittance received from January to November, 2020 
<br/>had exceeded expectation, surpassing the 2019 highest monthly remittance inflow of $60.5 million 
<br/>twice with record remittance in 2020, totalling $652.75 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  confirmed  that  the  Fijian  people  living  abroad  were  doing  more  to  our 
<br/>economy’s recovery than what this Government has been boasting about.  Mr. Speaker, the point that 
<br/>I  want  to  raise  in  this  House  is  why  this  Government  has  failed  to  publicly  acknowledge  the 
<br/>substantial  financial  contribution  from  Fijians  living  abroad  who  made  this  personal  sacrifice  to 
<br/>ensure  that  their  families  who  had  suffered  due  to  this  Government’s  poor  decision  and 
<br/>mismanagement.  Even in his two previous budget address, the honourable Minister for Economy 
<br/>has  not  mentioned  anything  about  the  remittance.    Never!    He  never  acknowledged  about  the 
<br/>contribution of these people in his previous two budget address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, their silence confirms their immaturity, juvenility, inexperience, arrogance and ignorance 
<br/>of the fact that it was remittance that kept our economy afloat and our families sustained.  Sir, we all 
<br/>understand that the government assistance either be food ration, financial assistance or material in 
<br/>kind will reach victims of disasters after weeks and months due to verification process, however, it 
<br/>is the remittance that kept families afloat from day one.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  one  wonders  why  they  are  silent.    Maybe,  they  are  ashamed  of  themselves 
<br/>because some of the people that have been banned and cannot return to this country due to some 
<br/>politically-motivated decisions are the very people that are contributing through this remittance or 
<br/>they do not want their lies and incompetency to be exposed since they have been claiming that it was 
<br/>their good decisions and prudent macroeconomic and microeconomic policies and programmes that 
<br/>has kept our economy functioning during the COVID-19 crisis.  But this is a lie.   It was the remittance 
<br/>that kept our families sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic as being revealed by the RBF.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  Sir,  I  ask  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy that it is not too late to humble themselves and be honest about the real economic situation 
<br/>that we experienced during the time of this review and issue a public statement to acknowledge the 
<br/>financial contribution and contribution in kind made by our people living and working abroad.  We 
<br/>are coming close to a cyclone season and there is a high probability that cyclone will strike again, so 
<br/>please do the right thing since we know that you have been doing the wrong thing all the time.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Mr. Speaker, at the outset, SODELPA also wishes to pay tribute to 
<br/>Justice Reddy who in many ways, was an icon in the area of laws and politics, especially those of my 
<br/>generation.  We remember him as someone who was always calm and with him around, one has a 
<br/>sense of stability which we needed, given our troubled history.  Our condolences to his family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we debate the Reserve Bank of Fiji Annual Report, an area that I would 
<br/>ask the government to dwell on or to brief Parliament and the people of Fiji is in the area relating to 
<br/>the health of our financial system.  We have just come through this COVID-19 and we know that 
<br/>there were a lot of bad debts incurred during that period. Sir, SODELPA would like to know how 
<br/>much bad debt is there in the financial system; whether the banks are managing them well.  Whether 
<br/>they are comfortable with it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because bad debts can impact on the financial system 
<br/></span><span>of the banks in a big way and can affect the banks and you know what would happen if that became 
<br/></span><span>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I would ask the honourable Minister for Economy if he can make a statement, to assure 
<br/>us that the bad debts that we know that are there, we cannot say that there was no bad debts but the 
<br/>value of it and how the banks are coping with it and that they are able to stay solvent and continue to 
<br/>provide  financial  services  to  the  country.    We  would  ask  that  the  assurance  to  be  made  to  this 
<br/>Parliament and to the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nadi was the most badly affected region during COVID-19, we remember 
<br/>that Nadi Town and Nadi Airport were like  a ghost town and  I wonder if there is an initiative or a 
<br/>scheme that can be put together by the Reserve Bank of Fiji to help the businesses in Nadi recover 
<br/>from COVID-19.   It is coming to us as a party that we should do something about it, a lot of Nadi 
<br/>businesses have suffered and they would be looking to some support from the Reserve Bank of Fiji, 
<br/>in terms of some facilities, to help them get back on their feet, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, maybe, the 
<br/>Government can do that as oppose to waiting for SODELPA to come into power and set it in place.  
<br/>We can do it right away, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also need to speak on the remittances.  I was in the United States about 
<br/></span><span>two weeks ago and it is amazing the demand for our people in America, especially in the areas where 
<br/>people need care and comfort and sometimes we do not realise our strength.  Our strength is the way 
<br/>we are, the way we relate to each other, the easy going manner with which we live our lives and this 
<br/>appeals to those who need care and comfort.  In America today, Fijians are highly in demand by 
<br/>those who need this kind of attention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is something that we should be proud 
<br/>of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was told that in an oil field somewhere in Pennsylvania, Colorado, the Fijian workers were 
<br/>the most preferred compared to other nationalities that are there because they do not complain, they 
<br/>are accommodative, they are happy people and they will just say, “Look you people are different, 
<br/>there are others from the Latin American countries who are also there”.  So, that is our strength, as a 
<br/>people, we should always try and celebrate. I know that initiatives are in place for more people to go 
<br/>abroad and we should all support that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst on that topic, Mr. Speaker, I also heard from people who have been in the US for about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>2128 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20 years or so that their status needed to be formalised, and they cannot come back to Fiji.  They are 
<br/>very restricted in the way they live in the US.  I would urge Government to take this up with the US 
<br/>authorities and try and formalise their status. They have been paying taxes in America, they have 
<br/>been providing service in America but  they still do not  have that formal status  to  enable them to 
<br/>return to Fiji and to be a free person in terms of mobility.  So, I would urge the Government, and we 
<br/>would certainly take that up with the US government to try and formalise this for those who do not 
<br/>have that formal status in the US.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been said many times by my colleagues who have spoken today that they are the ones 
<br/>that been keeping us alive for quite some time.  I believe lately it was close to $900 million or more 
<br/>than $1 billion during the pandemic which was quite significant, Mr. Speaker, and we need to do this 
<br/>for them.  I would urge Government to take that up and help our people overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are my comments, Mr. Speaker, and I commend the Committee for their Report on the 
<br/>Reserve Bank of Fiji.  I used to sit in the Economic Affairs Standing Committee and I was always 
<br/>impressed with the professionalism of the RBF - the manner they presented their Reports and the 
<br/>quality of the information they provided for us.  We would like to see them address the issue that I 
<br/>have raised in terms of the solvency of the financial system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- I rise to speak on the motion by the honourable Vijay Nath 
<br/>but before I do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need to say that today we mourn a Fijian patriot.  Like the 
<br/>NFP leaders who preceded him, Mr. Jai Ram Reddy championed the same cause of common and 
<br/>equal citizenry which our Constitution has finally guaranteed, and that unites us as fellow Fijians.  It 
<br/>is with gratitude that we honour this true son of Fiji. I know for a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he would 
<br/>not be performing like the honourable Professor Prasad if he was in Parliament today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for 
<br/>their comprehensive deliberations of the Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last few years have 
<br/>been  unprecedented  for  Fiji  and  the  world.    The  challenges  presented  and  impacts  felt  from  the 
<br/>COVID-19  pandemic  meant  that  critical  proactive  measures  had  to  be  undertaken  by  my 
<br/>Government.  The Reserve Bank of Fiji also introduced a slough of important policies to mitigate 
<br/>severe economic impacts and I join the Committee in commending them for taking swift action in 
<br/>this regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji faced a devastating economic contraction during the worst period of the 
<br/>pandemic with a 21 percent cumulative decline over the past two years. As a Small Island Developing 
<br/></span><span>State (SIDS) Fiji bore the extreme brunt of a one-in-a-century event losing $4.6 billion in GDP over 
<br/></span><span>two  years  and  about  $4  billion  in  tourism  earnings.  Government  moved  swiftly  to  buffer  Fijians 
<br/>against the worst  impacts  however our people were not  completely spared  -  no country was, Sir.  
<br/>Over 100,000 Fijians lost their jobs virtually overnight or had their hours significantly reduced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mothers,  fathers,  sisters,  brothers,  aunties  and  uncles  -  every  Fijian  -  has  had  to  work 
<br/>alongside my Government on the tough road to recovery.  They worked alongside us because they 
<br/>saw our commitment and trusted us to lead our people out of the international crisis and back onto 
<br/>our pre-COVID-19 path of stellar growth.  RBF has been paramount every step of the way. Response 
<br/>measures  during  the  review  period  included  lowering  the  RBF  key  interest  rate  which  aimed  to 
<br/>encourage demand and support consumption and investment.  It also included increasing allocations 
<br/>to Substitution and Export Finance Facility, and the Disaster Rehabilitation and Containment Facility 
<br/>which included support for MSMEs.  It meant investing in government bonds in 2020 and providing 
<br/>guidance on loans during the crisis period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Committee’s review highlights that Fiji’s Foreign Reserves have remained 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>above the benchmark during the review period.  Remittances have increased along with the greater 
<br/>emphasis on digital transactions.  The 2020-2021 financial year recorded an increase of 283.5 percent 
<br/>in mobile money services.  We know there is unlimited potential in improving our digital finance 
<br/>sector as well as developing outsourcing as a key economic sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even in the face of a global crisis, Fiji is showing resilience and innovation in our recovery.  
<br/>The Government is walking the talk and not looking for the easy way out - remaining committed to 
<br/>truly leaving no one behind in the good times and the bad times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note I am encouraged by RBF’s SDG implementation in their work 
<br/>including SDG 3 on Good Health and Well-Being, SDG 4 on Quality Education, SDG 5 on Gender 
<br/>Equality,  SDG  8  on  Decent  Work  and  Economic  Growth,  SDG  9  on  Industry,  Innovation  and 
<br/>Infrastructure, SDG 10 on Reduced Inequalities, SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, 
<br/>SDG 13 on Climate Action and SDG 17 on Partnerships for Goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Fiji continues to face economic shocks in response to ongoing COVID-19 effects, climate 
<br/>change  impacts  and  overseas  conflicts,  I  can  assure  our  people  that  my  Government  is  doing  its 
<br/>utmost to secure a stable, sustainable future for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  commend  the  RBF  for  being  such  a  dependable  partner  and  for  their  team’s  ongoing 
<br/>contribution  towards  Fiji’s  economic  recovery  and  growth.    I  have  heard  honourable  Inosi 
<br/>Kuridrani’s comments - I would not believe a word he says.  I do not like people who are disloyal to 
<br/>the party and I feel sorry for these guys opposite the room, since he is going to move PAP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Don’t worry about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- No, I feel sorry for you.  I do not feel sorry for you at the 
<br/>back.   I feel  sorry for people of SODELPA  for people like honourable Kuridrani.   He is  like the 
<br/>former member of the party who he is going to join honourable Sitiveni Rabuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is no longer honourable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- He is no longer honourable, sorry.  He moved just to win the 
<br/>election and just to be part of a winning team.  That is not the way to go - moving bum to bum on the 
<br/>seats across the room. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on those remarks, I support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please  allow  me  to  present  some 
<br/>thoughts on the Report of the Committee on the Consolidated Review Reports of the RBF 2018 – 
<br/>2019, 2019 – 2020 and 2020 – 2021 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While I can appreciate that the Committee may be overwhelmed by its backlog of work and 
<br/>the space deficit that we all know about within the parliamentary precincts, it makes scheduling of 
<br/>Committee meeting rooms availability difficult.  The Report is particularly hard to read and I say this 
<br/>because I cannot really tell what degree of review, scrutiny, examination or consideration that the 
<br/>honourable Nath as Chairperson, led his team through with this consolidated report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, let me back that up Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Annual Report is for three financial years.  
<br/>The actual report itself has one page, containing seven recommendations - two pages about SDGs, 
<br/>while the actual meat of it is in the Annexure where the RBF basically wrote nine pages of another 
<br/>report about itself but centred it to present day circumstances.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2130 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, I ask the Committee Chairperson, honourable Nath, why did 
<br/>you not just let the RBF write the Committee review report on itself or maybe it did.  The taxpayers 
<br/>of  this  country  are  expected  to  pay  for  this  standard  of  workmanship  set  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Chairperson.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us look at the actual recommendations.   Recommendation 2 is excited 
<br/>about the rate of remittances for the 2020-2021 financial year that boosted the economy by 283.5 
<br/>percent  through  mobile  money  services.    If  the  Chairperson  saw  fit  to  highlight  the  massive 
<br/>remittances  injection  in  Recommendation  2  for  that  year,  why  was  he  not  as  excited  about  the 
<br/>remittance percentages for 2018-2019?  What laws or policies impede or incentivise these remittance 
<br/>flows?  All that the report says, as lifted straight out from what the RBF says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…  inward  remittances  including  international  mobile  money  transfers  in  the  2020-2021 
<br/>financial  year, grew by 15.4 percent to a total of $740 million compared to a 6.8 percent 
<br/>growth in the 2019-2020 ….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the Chairperson is welcoming of financial support from our people abroad via remittances 
<br/>in this Recommendation 2 then logically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he and his Committee Members should 
<br/></span><span>oppose barriers to remittances like decreasing the threshold for cash transaction reports by financial 
<br/></span><span>institutions  from  $10,000  to  $5,000  when  the  Financial  Transaction  Reporting  Act  comes  up  for 
<br/>debate later this week.  It was also curious that the RBF Annex in the report sees fit to single out and 
<br/>I quote “M-PAiSA by Vodafone Fiji and MyCash by Digicel” as the main carriers of remittances for 
<br/>international mobile money.  I hope an independent institution like RBF is not providing free PR to 
<br/>these entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Recommendation 2 on the high remittance percentages might, in fact, be 
<br/>tunnel-visioned  if  there  was  no  consideration  paid  whatsoever  by  the  Committee  Chairperson,  to 
<br/>invite the views of the Government arm [the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)] to advise on possible 
<br/>risks  of  remittance  flows  for  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and  other  serious  criminal 
<br/>activities.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to digress just very briefly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Elections Office invited political parties for a briefing with the Head of FIU, the 
<br/>NFP  asked  the  FIU  whether  it  could  provide  clearance  for  our  proposed  candidates  prior  to  the 
<br/>nomination process. It was in good faith that we sort this so that we could be confident that the people, 
<br/>that  the  NFP  selects  are  credible  as  politically  exposed  persons  and  originators  or  receivers  of 
<br/>financial transactions, seeing as they will be contesting to represent people in this Parliament.  The 
<br/></span><span>surprise to that request (I am reliably told Mr. Speaker) is that Mr. Saneem himself made visible eye 
<br/></span><span>and head gestures to the Director in front of all the political parties present, to signal that the Director 
<br/>should refuse this request and we wonder, why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Recommendation 3 in this Report talks about the Housing Facility for Low 
<br/>Income Earners Scheme.  Honourable Nath, as Chairperson, writes that the funds allocated for this 
<br/>initiative  should  be  fully  utilised  and  perhaps,  he  has  not  availed  himself  of  the  2019  Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report which said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Unutilised budget of $27 million in capital expenditure was due to unspent budgets 
<br/>for  programs  under  SEGs  8  &amp;  10  which  included  the  upgrade  of  informal  settlements, 
<br/>upgrade of town-wide informal settlements, city-wide upgrade First Home and First Land 
<br/>Programs, HART, Interest Subsidy for Home Loans, Social Housing Assistance and survey 
<br/>for regularization of lease and land titles.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, suddenly, Mr. Speaker, Recommendation 4 takes a turn to support Business Process 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2131 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outsourcing (BPO).  Was that industry even viable in the financial period of these Reports?  It is like 
<br/>this recommendation was plucked out of thin air. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You have no idea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Yes,  we  understand  that  BPO  represents  an  economic 
<br/>opportunity, but when crafting this recommendation, did the Chairperson and his team consider what 
<br/>many people working those irregular hours in this lucrative sector, backed up by tax incentives, are 
<br/>being paid?  It is something like $10,000 per annum.  Did the Chairperson do the math? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Recommendation 6, the Chairperson leads his team to advocate how the MSME Technical 
<br/>Working Group liaised with MCTTT to advance initiatives that support the MSME Sector.  But then 
<br/>what? What impact, projected or real, did the Committee envisage as tangible targets?  Why is there 
<br/>a recommendation telling groups already working together, to keep working together?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RBF Report, in the Annex, did not mention this, just like it did not mention anything 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>related to BPOs as per Recommendation 4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that this could be the final Parliamentary Sitting week for 
<br/></span><span>this 2018 parliamentary term because all this workmanship and mindless attempts to look busy doing 
<br/>nothing, with taxpayers’ money, supported by </span><span>dinau</span><span>, is about to end.  When we are sitting on the 
<br/>other side, Mr. Speaker, the Chairperson and his Committee can learn from us on how to do proper 
<br/>due diligence when Annual Reports are tabled in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have asked you in the past to put your names down 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if you want to speak.  You have a tendency of jumping up and down at will, so do not do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to thank the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Economic Affairs (even though they have been corrected by honourable Qereqeretabua) in regard 
<br/>to the 2018-2019 Report, for the speedup of this Report, and I thank the RBF for the independence 
<br/>of their Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can see here that they have just given us their press release last week on 25</span><span>th</span><span> August, and it 
<br/>details  the inflation control, most of the remittances, et  cetera, and it reflects  that they have been 
<br/>doing their work.  Their independence has not been touched, and I reflect on the independence of 
<br/>RBF, the independence  of the Fiji  Bureau of Statistics and the independence of the Office of the 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General - this Government should always keep that independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee for their Report, even though it is not really detailed to the Annual 
<br/>Report.  But thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to thank the Committee and I support the 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to some of the comments 
<br/>that have been made from the other side, I just want to highlight a couple of points.  Generally, when 
<br/>we talk about reserve banks or central banks, they are charged with the responsibility of maintaining 
<br/>low and stable inflation that is conducive to steady economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In small open economies like Fiji, the role of central banks extends to ensuring a comfortable 
<br/>level of foreign reserves, which is critical for investor confidence as insufficient levels necessitate 
<br/>adjustments or devaluation, indeed, of the currency.  None of the honourable Members from the other 
<br/>side ever talked about foreign reserves and I suspect that they do not even understand the implications 
<br/>of having low or high foreign reserves, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  order to  appreciate the work of the RBF over the past  three financial 
<br/>years,  I just would like to highlight  some of the critical  issues.  The Fijian economy recorded its 
<br/>highest growth in history of 12.4 percent in 2022; foreign reserves is currently sitting at $3.6 billion, 
<br/>just marginally below the record high sufficient to cover nine months of imports; inflation during the 
<br/>past three financial years average at about 1 percent and it is currently 5.2 percent on account of the 
<br/>Ukraine war and associated as well as the pandemic related supply chain issues.  This outcome is, of 
<br/>course,  commendable  given  the  inflation  levels  registered  in  our  major  trading  partners  and 
<br/>economies are at record high levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, we have avoided devaluation of the Fijian currency.  Again, an issue lost on them, 
<br/>which would have adversely affected all Fijians in a period where imported inflation has remained 
<br/>significantly high.  The Bank liquidity is around $2.6 billion and is supportive of economic recovery.  
<br/>The private sector credit growth is positive and gaining momentum with commercial bank new loans 
<br/>totalling about $1.8 billion for the first seven months of this year.  So $1.8 billion in fact has been 
<br/>injected  into  the  economy  by  loans  from  the  banks  by  the  private  sector.    Commercial  banking 
<br/>lending rates have been trending downwards and are currently in a historical low of 5.4 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The stability of our financial system, as honourable Gavoka alluded to, is a reflective in the 
<br/></span><span>satisfactory  performance  of  the  commercial  bank  industry  and  based  on  the  satisfactory  levels  of 
<br/></span><span>capital, earnings, liquidity and marginal asset quality.  The Bred Bank, as you would know, last year 
<br/>in fact injected new capital, new equity into Bred Bank Fiji.  Similarly, the insurance industry has 
<br/>registered a strong consolidated solvency position and satisfactory levels of earnings and liquidity.  
<br/>Furthermore, the FNPF continued to report positive operating results over the reporting period and 
<br/>adequately met its legislated solvency requirements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister highlighted how the RBF, in fact, on 18</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>March, 2020, reduced the overnight policy rates by 25 basis points, which helps stimulate demand 
<br/>by  lowering  the  cost  of  borrowing  and  supporting  consumption  and  investment  activities.  
<br/>Honourable Qereqeretabua will learn a lot from by listening to this.  As part of its measures to reduce 
<br/>the cost of borrowing and at the same time ensure that businesses survive the sharp pandemic fuel 
<br/>contraction in the economy, the RBF increased funding available through its two concessional loan 
<br/>facilities.  The honourable Prime Minister had mentioned this, the disaster rehabilitation containment 
<br/>facility  and  the  import  substitution  and  export  finance  facility  to  $350  million  and  $500  million 
<br/>respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  interest  rate  under  both  the  facilities  were  reduced  from  5  percent  to  a 
<br/></span><span>whopping 3.99 percent, and contributed to interest savings of around $20 million per annum.  This 
<br/></span><span>means directly jobs.  The Opposition do not see the correlation between this and economic activity, 
<br/>and indeed social enhancement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  RBF  also  collaborated  with  the  Government  to  introduce  an  additional  $200  million 
<br/>funding allocation for loans to micro, small and medium enterprises coupled with Government Loan 
<br/>Guarantee,  cover  up  to  90  percent  and  two-year  interest  rate  subsidy.    The  initiative  directly 
<br/>benefitted over 5,500 businesses by generating cost savings at least $10million over the two-year 
<br/>period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some of the highlights as far as the RBF is concerned.  The Bank’s 
<br/>twin  monetary  policy  objective  of  low  inflation,  maintaining  adequate  level  of  foreign  reserves 
<br/>remain intact during the review period, inflation averaged minus 1.3 percent and minus 1.8 percent 
<br/>in  the  2019-2020  and  2021  financial  years  respectively,  compared  to  the  average  of  3.8  percent 
<br/>recorded in the preceding year of 2018-2019.  The RBF’s accommodative monetary policy stance 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2133 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including participation in the bond market enabled the Government to meet its funding requirement 
<br/>in the domestic market at low cost resulting in notable debts servicing cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one point that none of the honourable Members also mentioned, honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua,  following  the  approval  of  the  National  Payment  System  Act  by  Parliament  in 
<br/>February 2021, the RBF in fact has embarked on a journey to modernise Fiji’s payment system law 
<br/>and infrastructure to effectively and efficiently meet the growing needs and aspirations of the Fijian 
<br/>economy.  The reform is expected to be completed in early 2023 with the introduction of a centralised 
<br/>security depository and the upgraded real time gross settlement system going live in November 2022.  
<br/>So, essentially what this means is, the entire financial system becomes completely integrated.  We 
<br/>are able to track money better, we are able to have payment systems a lot better and things like cheque 
<br/>books will go out of fashion.  There is no necessity for that.  It will reduce the cost of doing business 
<br/>and make Fiji furthermore a financial hub.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  would  just  like  to  comment  on  a  couple  of  things.    I  had  talked  about  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad misleading Parliament regarding the definition of what wages and pay is.  He also 
<br/>went to say that by Government agreeing to reduce the FNPF contribution both, by the employer and 
<br/>employee, the employee somehow or the other by having their amount reduced was giving money to 
<br/></span><span>the employer.  Sir, if I as an employee, 8 percent was deducted from my salary and now there will be 
<br/></span><span>5 percent deducted, it does not mean that the 3 percent has gone to the employer.  It simply means 
<br/>that the 3 percent is going in my pocket.  That is what it means.  It means I am taking more money 
<br/>home in my pocket as opposed to putting in a savings, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order.  I think the honourable Attorney-General is 
<br/>deliberately misleading  what  I said.    I said  that when  you reduce the FNPF contribution  from  18 
<br/>percent to 10 percent, 5 percent of that reduction was for the employers, contribution to the employees 
<br/>FNPF fund and 3 percent the employees took themselves into their pay which was supposed to go to 
<br/>FNPF.  That is what I said.  So, please do not mislead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, unfortunately, I have to say this, Honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad has gained a reputation of misrepresenting the very misrepresentation that he makes himself.  
<br/>So I will say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to explain to all the other SODELPA and PAP Members just in 
<br/>case they get misled by him, that when a person no longer gets 8 percent deducted from his or her 
<br/>salary and has only 5 percent, that means that 3 percent goes in his or her pocket; 5 percent then goes 
<br/>to FNPF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  highlighted  in  his  address  just  now  in 
<br/></span><span>response that we lost over 100,000 jobs overnight.  There are thousands of Fijians who had reduced 
<br/>hours.  We had people actually coming to us and saying, “We no longer want to pay FNPF, we just 
<br/>want more money in our pocket now.  We have to live now.  We do not care about the savings.”  
<br/>Here they are, standing up and pontificating and saying that was the wrong thing to do.  We managed 
<br/>to achieve a middle of the ground approach where people still had savings but we reduced their FNPF 
<br/>contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and these are the hard core realities on the ground that a 
<br/>lot of employers were actually going to fire people or no longer could carry them because they no 
<br/>longer had the cash flow. So in order to preserve jobs also, Sir, we reduced their FNPF contribution 
<br/>from 10 percent to 5 percent.  Is it not better that someone has a job, has 5 percent less contribution 
<br/>by the employer but actually has a job? That is critically important and all those employees actually 
<br/>appreciate that.  That is what they do not talk about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prasad went on and said, “Oh, there was economic contraction 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>2134 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in 2019.”  Yes -0.6 percent, not even 1 percent.    Worldwide there was contractions all over but we 
<br/>had a modest contraction of 0.6 percent.  But what he does in the same breath, he does not talk about 
<br/>the nine years of growth before that and that has been proven, verified, validated, confirmed – not 
<br/>just by us, by all the international agencies, by all the multilateral development banks – nine years of 
<br/>growth and that is the Bainimarama Boom and we stand by that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s GDP has doubled in a span of 10 years.  Sir, 10 years!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The GDP doubled.  There was a contraction of 0.6 percent.  
<br/>Unfortunately  for  the  world  and  for  Fiji,  of  course,  because  we  are  part  of  the  world,  we  had  an 
<br/>economic  contraction  because  of  a  once-in-a-hundred-year  event;  a  pandemic.    The  economy 
<br/>contracted in excess of 17 percent then last year by 4 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we managed through that.  To-date, the Opposition have not uttered a single 
<br/>word to say what they would have done.  They have not said what they would have done.  All they 
<br/>say, “Oh, contraction took place; the debt is high” but they have not said what would they have done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it started from a very basic issue.  When we do lockdown they say, “Do not 
<br/>do lockdown”.  When we lift up the lockdown, they said “do the lockdown”. Get vaccinated, they 
<br/>say “do not get vaccinated”.  They do not understand the fundamentals about a small country like 
<br/>Fiji  which  is  hugely  dependent  on  imports.    The  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  highlighted  the 
<br/>revenue that we lost overnight and the level of tourism earnings that we lost over $4 billion.  For a 
<br/>small country like Fiji it meant a huge dent to our foreign reserves but what did the Government do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government changed its permutation regarding its borrowing, we normally borrow from 
<br/>onshore, left from offshore. This time we changed the permutation, got war from offshore. Why? 
<br/>Because we have got new money coming in, we have got foreign currency coming in which buffers 
<br/>up our foreign reserves. If the foreign reserves had dropped, our dollar would have been devalued.  
<br/>They do not acknowledge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue is that when we acknowledge our contraction they said it is 
<br/>debt.  When we talk about debt and say how it has been managed and how there is a necessity and 
<br/>how we have the ability to do the cash flow, they show Sri Lanka.  When someone from Sri Lanka 
<br/>comes and debunks that, they go onto something else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the entire world went to contraction, </span><span>Google</span><span> it honourable Professor Prasad, 
<br/>that is where you get most of your information from.  You will see that most countries in the world, 
<br/>all had increased their debt levels because of the economic contraction globally.  Families who had 
<br/>to be fed, people’s livelihoods had to be supported, we did exactly the same.  We rolled out $432 
<br/>million.  Now, they are clutching at straws saying, “Oh, this should have been done, FNPF funds 
<br/>have been missing”.  FNPF gave a returned rate of more than 5 percent notwithstanding the fact that 
<br/>the economy contracted by 17.2 percent in excess of 5 percent.  During COVID too you do not even 
<br/>have your figures up to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua again has got it completely wrong like she got 
<br/>the fishing laws wrong. She said going around fishing and she gets the fishing laws wrong.  They 
<br/>talk  about,  “Oh  the  $5,000  threshold  now,  what  will  happen  to  the  remittances?”    </span><span>Areh</span><span>!    All 
<br/>remittances get reported.   If tomorrow I send $100 from Australia to my aunty’s M-PAiSA account, 
<br/>it will get reported because all remittances have to get reported. Do they understand how reporting 
<br/>works?  It simply means that whoever, not the customer but the agency that is facilitating the payment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-RBF 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2135 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has the obligation legally to report it because we could have a terrorist sending $100 every hour that 
<br/>can accumulate to $2,400 in one day.  Multiply that by the number of days, how much money you 
<br/>got coming in?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are so obtuse, they do not even think about it, they do not even read the reports.  Every 
<br/>single remittance gets recorded irrespective of the amount and she is going on about reporting of the 
<br/>$5,000  to  $10,000;  that  is  for  local  agencies,  local  transactions  and  also  it  does  not  affect  the 
<br/>customers.    It  is  the  bank’s  obligation,  it  is  the  law  firm’s  obligation,  it  is  the  accounting  firm’s 
<br/>obligation, it is the money exchange person’s obligation, not the customer’s obligation.  And why! 
<br/>They are saying, “Oh, are they advocating for M-PAiSA and MyCash.” There are only two money 
<br/>wallets available in Fiji who else would they talk about.  There are only two mobile phone companies.  
<br/>Have  they  ever  asked  the  question  why  are  more  people  sending  money  through  M-PAiSA  or 
<br/>MyCash? Because more people in Fiji have mobile phones now.  They did not have it before, the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government deregulated the telecommunication sector.  There was only one mobile 
<br/>phone company; only ATH, only FINTEL - now it is deregulated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 99 cents a unit cost for a call in peak period before, today it is 23 cents peak 
<br/>period.  No five-up, no top-up, no free talk time before, now you have that; 95 percent of Fijians have 
<br/></span><span>mobile  phone  connectivity  today,  that  is  why  their  relatives  know,  they  are  sitting  somewhere, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Gavoka went to California.  They want to send money to someone in the interior of Vanua 
<br/>Levu, they know they have connectivity, they will send them money, before they could not.  It was 
<br/>not even worth sending $100 because it will cost that person $150 to go and collect the money from 
<br/>the post box or from the postal money order or go to town.  Now they get instant payments on their 
<br/>phone.  Why?  Because this Government did it. Why?  Because this Government has invested in 
<br/>telecommunications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  They  talk  about,  “Oh,  was  the  BPO  sector  around  then? 
<br/></span><span>Areh</span><span>, it has been around for a long time. There is a company called ACS that was in the Ramarama 
<br/>House, Fijian Holdings Building. They have been there for donkey’s years, even before 2006 and 
<br/>they are questioning, “Oh, was it around then?” Of course, the amount of businesses, the number of 
<br/>businesses and the amount of frequency of that has changed significantly.  It has grown exponentially 
<br/>during this Government’s time. The tax incentives given has grown exponentially.  So, obviously 
<br/>there is huge impact, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wish to also make was, a number of Members from 
<br/></span><span>the other side constantly debunk independent institutions when those independent institutions either 
<br/>give good news or point out facts which they do not like and it is such a fundamental issue, Sir. We 
<br/>have seen that by the other side, they have attacked the Judiciary when it does not suit them. They 
<br/>have attacked FICAC when it does not suit them. They attacked DPP’s Office when it does not suit 
<br/>them. They attacked the RBF when it does not suit them. When they say something which they like, 
<br/>then they  will speak in  favour of it. When they  do not  like a decision, when they  give a positive 
<br/>report, they attack the institution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the entire basis of running a stable economy, running a stable country with fundamental 
<br/>social stability is to ensure that we maintain and indeed safeguard and guard the independence of all 
<br/>these independent institutions.  We have had decisions that have gone against Government in the 
<br/>judiciary whether it is civil or criminal at the DPP’s Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had people from this side of Parliament being charged by FICAC. We know people 
<br/>have been charged but have we ever attacked FICAC?  We have had decisions that we did not like.

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Have we attacked the Judiciary? We have had people who were being prosecuted that people know, 
<br/>some  people  from  this  side  of  Parliament  know  personally.  Have  we  attacked  the  DPP’s  Office? 
<br/>Have we maligned them publically?  No. They do that because for them everything is free for all.  I 
<br/>remember, honourable Professor Prasad said once that everything is fair in politics like everything is 
<br/>fair in love and war and we had said no, you remember that! </span><span>Hansard</span><span> is there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had at that point in time argued that not everything is fair in politics. 
<br/>There are certain things that should be sacrosanct like your independent institutions, like, Sir, your 
<br/>economy and like certain morals, values, principles that we must always adhere to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last one I would like to make, yesterday he made a comment when we 
<br/>were talking about the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. He said, “We know sometimes politicians offer 
<br/>the moon but that is okay for the individuals to figure out.”  He said that.  That is precisely what we 
<br/>want to avoid. We do not want politicians to go and offer people the moon.  We want them to offer 
<br/>the reality.  We want them to offer what can be done, what is possible, what is within the means of 
<br/>the country.  What is based on the law? What is based on morals, values and principles, not a frontier 
<br/>approach, gung ho, anything goes, that is essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What I would like to say in 
<br/>respect of this particular motion, I like to commend the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  We 
<br/></span><span>like to also congratulate him on his new term again for five years. We like to thank all the staff that 
<br/></span><span>have been involved in the Reserve Bank of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  also  thank  the  Committee.  I  also  want  to,  on  behalf  of  honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua, apologise to the Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Nath, because she singled 
<br/>him out. This is a Committee. It is made up for five people.  There are two people from the Opposition 
<br/>and three from the Government side yet politically motivated, she chose to single him out.  This is 
<br/>what  we  call  “unparliamentarily  approach”  to  matters.  In  the  same  way,  her  leader  chose  to  call 
<br/>everyone on this side “guys”.  This is what we called a new low in the Parliamentary debate that we 
<br/>have had, Sir.  I support the motion, thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  join  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  show  my 
<br/>condolence to Justice Reddy and his family.  In fact, he was a very principled leader and I met him a 
<br/>number of times.  A very principled leader by that I mean that after losing in 1999, he chose to resign. 
<br/>Here we have got another leader kicked out from the Public Accounts Committee, lost the fight but 
<br/>is still sitting here - very weird. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- To answer honourable Qereqeretabua, if you read 2.0 on page 6, it is our 
<br/>Findings and Recommendations.  Honourable Qereqeretabua you failed to read No. 5 and No. 7, if 
<br/>you would have read Nos. 5 and 7, then you would have understood that we have got Fiji Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit (FFIU) who also produced the report of the Committee and then you would not 
<br/>have asked the question.
