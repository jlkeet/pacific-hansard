<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - ENERGY FIJI LIMITED  
<br/>2019 AND 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/>in April 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The years 2019 and 2020 were filled with its own unique milestones and challenges for Energy 
<br/>Fiji Limited (EFL) with 2020 being the year that Fiji was hit with the first wave of COVID-19 cases. 
<br/>Like every other organisation in Fiji and around the globe, EFL too felt the brunt of its effect.  With 
<br/>international borders closing and the tourism industry and businesses coming to a standstill, EFL sales 
<br/>declined  significantly  due  to  the  drop  in  demand  for  electricity.    Despite  the  odds,  EFL  managed  to 
<br/></span><span>achieve a financial profit of $66.79 million after tax in 2020 as compared to an audited profit after tax of 
<br/></span><span>$63.74 million in 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended the great work carried out by EFL management and staff by keeping 
<br/>Fiji energized with managing assets over $1 billion to working 24/7 during natural disasters while also 
<br/>working within the restrictions posed due to COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While deliberating on the Report, it was evident that EFL had been continuously working towards 
<br/>ensuring ease of access to their services by a wide range of customers. Sir, EFL’s presence and services 
<br/>are available in the four main islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. Most of their 
<br/>customers are on post pay services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For logistical convenience, domestic customers in the rural remote areas are on a pre-pay service 
<br/>as it is more economical for both the customers and EFL. Sir, EFL has used various digital platforms to 
<br/>ensure  that  customers  are  able  to  pay  their  bills  conveniently  through  services  such  as  M-PAiSA, 
<br/>DigiWallet, Internet Banking and EFTPOS. Given that the world is moving towards digital technology 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2149 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>such initiatives are welcomed. The move towards digital platforms were especially welcomed as it greatly 
<br/>helped Fijians pay their bills during lockdown without having to pay their bills during lockdown without 
<br/>having to put themselves at risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee was very pleased to note that COVID-19 did not hinder EFL’s 
<br/>ability to enhance the skills and knowledge of their staff as training continues to run virtually in 2020 
<br/>despite the various limitations.   In fact,  EFL in  association with  JICA conducted two sessions of 
<br/>regional training on solar via online platform in March and November 2020 with 18 participants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  EFL  in  collaboration  with  the  Fijian  Government  under  the 
<br/>COVID-19 stimulus committed to assist low income household by providing subsidy towards the 
<br/>payment of the monthly electricity bills.  The Committee was pleased with the overall performance 
<br/>of EFL during the period under review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee applauds the hardworking EFL staff for their dedication and commitment in 
<br/>providing essential services to the people of Fiji despite the many challenges.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 
<br/>those few words, I request you to open the floor for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I was going to be the last, but since I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am the first, I am thankful for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There was a request for you to be first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I support the Report that is before us with regards to Energy Fiji 
<br/>Limited 2019-2020 Annual Reports.  The Standing Committee on Natural Resources always looks 
<br/>after reports that are five years and six years back.  Now, it is only two years back which is good.  
<br/>The earlier the annual reports are brought into this Parliament, the better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Board particularly with the Report here and the format that they have made and I 
<br/>wish to congratulate them.  They are telling about themselves, who they are, the Board of Directors, 
<br/>the management team, Chairman’s report, Executive Officer’s report, Corporate Governance which 
<br/>they are there for and also  key performance areas and the future that they are looking forward to of 
<br/>life after electricity and their financial statements and statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a good format of reporting, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just want to congratulate them on that 
<br/></span><span>particularly the EFL.  Also with their recommendations, we thank them that they have profited of 
<br/>about  $66.79  million  and  with  their  entire  2019  capital  expenditure  of  internal  cash  flow  of  $78 
<br/>million, that is good and EFL shareholder value increased to $851 million which we support and 
<br/>congratulate them on that.  The engagement of technological strategies in the media platform on QR 
<br/>codes as  they want  to  improve their services to  the customers as well,  particularly for the billing 
<br/>system that comes through our e-mails.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On four, the promoting and developing of sources of renewable energy which I will further 
<br/>talk on.  I am not familiar with the projects such as Ovalau Agro Photovoltaic Solar Project (I am not 
<br/>too  familiar  with  that).  The  Climate  Change  Prevention  Policy,  maybe  that  is  a  private  change 
<br/>mitigation policy, I suppose because we cannot stop climate change, it will come.  The climate is 
<br/>going to change and we need to have mitigation policies along that line.  I will be talking more along 
<br/>that line, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also thank that the future plan is a 10-year power development plan.  With all those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>2150 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations, Sir, I wish to further add that it is important particularly with the high rise of fuel 
<br/>cost, et cetera, we need to improve or increase our energy source for renewable source or national 
<br/>grid  source,  particularly  the  need  to  increase  our  biomass.  We  only  have  one  biomass  in  Nabou, 
<br/>Nadroga, if that can be replicated in Vanua Levu so much the better because they have contributed a 
<br/>lot to the supply of energy to EFL.  We can also encourage TFL to open up doors and take more 
<br/>energy from biomass here or in Ovalau or also in Vanua Levu as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to increase the capacity of these energy producers in Fiji to 
<br/>avoid going into diesel or fuel and also it properly uses waste, particularly timber waste around here 
<br/>in Fiji. It is important to increase the capacity of supply of energy from these energy factories and 
<br/>also increase the hydro throughout Fiji.  We only have a few here but if there can be more hydros in 
<br/>Fiji particularly in Bua.  There needs to be one in Wainunu, I have mentioned it before and I wish to 
<br/>repeat it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The experts of water has already done their job many years back and it is feasible but it has 
<br/>not been carried out for the last 10 years to 15 years. The experts have mentioned that it is feasible 
<br/>but still they have not done it. So it is important to fill that hydro in Wainunu, the capacity is bigger 
<br/>than Bagata, Savusavu that supplies energy to Savusavu and Wailevu areas, et cetera.  The capacity 
<br/></span><span>in Nuku, Wainunu is a bit bigger than that. It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to identify those various 
<br/></span><span>areas and develop them to supply renewable energy.  Also to increase solar everywhere as we have 
<br/>introduced electric cars, we need more energy all over Fiji to be able to feed our electric cars as they 
<br/>come across.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that this hydro and renewable energy are available in the rural 
<br/>areas where agricultural products, fisheries and prawns will need power for those cooling centres. It 
<br/>is important to extend or expand the development and growth of energy factories throughout the rural 
<br/>areas whether it is hydro or solar or wind, et cetera.  It is important to increase the energy supply in 
<br/>the rural areas to be able to preserve the agricultural products in future.  If you cannot do it, then we 
<br/>will  be  doing  it  next  year  but  it  is  important  to  increase  the  supply  of  energy  throughout  wind, 
<br/>biomass. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Waves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- If you can get energy from water, that is fine.  It is important, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to increase development in the rural areas where this can be supplied.  In Bua, still there 
<br/>are also hydro areas that have been identified but not implemented.  In Nasowana, they have not done 
<br/></span><span>a feasible study there.  Also in Dama in Driti and Lekutu, these are areas where the experts need to 
<br/></span><span>explore the need to provide increased energy in the rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to increase all these particularly, solar for villages.  It is 
<br/>important that we change from diesel to solar. In my own village, we have been waiting for the last 
<br/>10 years for solar but it has not come.  We were one of the first  generator-powered, but it is not 
<br/>working now and we need solar, so as in Cogea, honourable Jale Sigarara’s village as well.  It is 
<br/>important that this comes, the sooner the better.  If you cannot do it, then we will do it next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the motion that is before us, but I also like one chapter here where it says, “Life 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after electricity”; I like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- You listen.  Not life after dark.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2151 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is life after electricity.  I like this, it is good.  We need light, we need guidance and we need 
<br/>the truth for the future.  Also it is important for us.  Life after the elections this year, it will be very 
<br/>interesting.  The lights will be revealed, it is important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is more important, it is life after death.  There is no other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way, only Jesus Christ, the way, truth and the life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  make  a  brief 
<br/>contribution  to  the  debate  in  Parliament.    I  will  drive  your  focus  directly  to  the  Chairperson’s 
<br/>foreword on paragraph 2, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“With international borders closing and the tourism industry and business coming to 
<br/>a standstill, EFL sales declined significantly due to a drop in the demand for electricity.  
<br/>The Committee commends EFL for achieving a financial profit of $66.79 million after tax 
<br/>in 2020, as compared to an audited profit after tax of $63.74 million in 2019 despite the 
<br/>odds.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is very amazing and I thank the EFL for this milestone achievement, despite the odds, they still 
<br/>made profit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will refer you, Sir, to the findings and recommendations by the Committee, No. 2, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Committee  was  pleased  to  note  that  EFL  funded  the  entire  2019  capital 
<br/>expenditure from its internal cash flow of $78.2 million.  It was further noted that EFL’s 
<br/>shareholder’s value increased to $851 million at the end of 2019 in comparison to $805 
<br/>million in 2018.  The EFL’s total asset value rose to $1.41 billion at the end of 2019 up 
<br/>from around $1.38 billion in 2018.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is quite amazing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Recommendation No. 7 stated, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Committee noted that EFL debt stood at $190.53 million as at December 2020 
<br/></span><span>compared to $219.74 million as at December 2019; a reduction of $29.21 million.  EFL 
<br/></span><span>has a low gearing debt ratio and is primarily due to the profit recorded in 2020.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the indicators showed that EFL was performing very well, but in 2021, it is strange that 
<br/>the Government decided to sell the 44 percent shares.  If a company is performing very well, why 
<br/>do we have to sell the shares?  I understand that to sell shares is a source of income for a company 
<br/>that might be struggling, a company that wants to diversify and expand, but here according to the 
<br/>financial  indicators,  EFL  was  doing  very  well.    My  question  and  concern  is,  why  did  the 
<br/>Government sell those 44 percent shares?  It is strange.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Sir, it is strange, because of this sale of shares, it confirms one thing 
<br/>which is that the EFL financial position was fake or information and data were distorted.  It does not 
<br/>reveal the credibility and integrity of the EFL financial performance as indicated in the Annual Report 
<br/>because you sell the shares to get money.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Research!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Why is he talking about research?  You do not understand what research 
<br/>is.  Sir, that is what I am saying.  My understanding is when you sell shares, it is a source of fund to the 
<br/>company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are wrong there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- If the company, it is stated here that the company itself funded its own 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>capital investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So it should.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- From its cash flow. Yeah!  So it sounds it is in a very good financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>position situation.  Then why sell the shares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Why sell the shares?  And for the sale of shares, it is this restructure of 
<br/></span><span>the board: EFL ownership structure changed on the 9</span><span>th</span><span> of June, 2021 after the Sevens Pacific Pte Limited 
<br/>acquired 44 percent of the shares and this will need four directors to be appointed by the government and 
<br/>three directors from the 44 percent shareholders from this foreign company.  I do not understand the logic 
<br/>why this Government sell 44 percent of shares of EFL for the people of Fiji to a foreign company when 
<br/>the company itself was performing very well.  Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute on the motion on 
<br/>EFL.  The findings and recommendations as stated, I would like to highlight No. 4.  There is a mention 
<br/>there  about  projects  in  relation  to  renewable  energy:  Ovalau  Agrophotovoltaic  Solar  Project  and  my 
<br/>understanding is that, this has been held up due to COVID-19.  But if you look at page 13 of the Report, 
<br/>there is an update there which indicates that it is a project just for our information – Green Climate Fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite an interesting project because it interfaces with agriculture activity.  The total project 
<br/>cost will be US$3.9 million and can be safely exported into the EFL grid. It is a sustainable and integrated 
<br/>approach to ensure food security and also ensuring that Ovalau Island has 100 percent renewable energy 
<br/>by 2025.  So it is a very positive project, interesting and we hope that is progressed soon because from 
<br/>the information we have, it is being held up due to COVID-19 issues regarding the implementation and 
<br/></span><span>materials.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one I thought that I highlight is on No. 5 – independent power producers.  This is also 
<br/>a key element in our energy plans for the nation and as highlighted by honourable Bulanauca, the Nabou 
<br/>Biomass.  The last time we visited there, one of the issues was the supply of material to be burnt, biomass 
<br/>or logs, timber.  However, the problem arose because of the planting of those materials and issues with 
<br/>the plantations and one of the suggestions we came up with was if there could be further discussions with 
<br/>the  Nadroga  Provincial  Council,  Ba  Provincial  Council  on  the  supply  especially  with  some  of  the 
<br/>materials which are there and which are considered to be invasive species such as the African tulips which 
<br/>are around.  So that is another possibility and we are hoping that will be progressed so that that plant is 
<br/>operational.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise issues from the Report.  I think it is critical even though 
<br/>the recommendations are there we had highlighted various issues and if you look at the financials 
<br/>there is emphasis of matter on page 54.  Let me read it out: “The Company has been recording assets 
<br/>generated from the Rural Electrification Scheme as part of its property, plant and equipment in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2153 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>books of account (Note 11) over the years. Government is yet to transfer the ownership of these assets 
<br/>to the company”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  if  you  look  at  page  28  it  highlights  the  importance  of  rural  electrification  and  it  has 
<br/>progressed and that has to be acknowledged, 70 Rural Electrification (RE) Schemes were constructed 
<br/>in 2020 to connect new customers.  These RE Schemes were totally funded by the Fijian Government 
<br/>to energise the nation and citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of the commissioning of the above Rural Electrification schemes the total number 
<br/>of customers rose by 3.3 percent contributing to the total customer base of EFL.  That Sir, is again 
<br/>another critical area of activity of EFL however, as I mentioned there is an emphasis of matter on 
<br/>rural electrification.  This means that EFL has not included the Rural Electrification Scheme assets 
<br/>in its property, plant and equipment and it has not been properly transferred.  The question is: when 
<br/>might this be formally transferred to EFL?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one highlighted the Review of Impairment of Assets with zero book value that has 
<br/>not been done if the assets are in use then it has some economic life and should reflect an increase in 
<br/>asset values in the balance sheet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question there is why was this not conducted?  There is also the issue on note 3.1 - Risk 
<br/>Management on page 78 – Financial Risk Factors the financial assets of the company totalled $159.8 
<br/>million comprising short term deposits, receivables, derivatives - this is more than sufficient to cover 
<br/>the  financial  liabilities  of  $52  million  comprising  trade  and  other  payables,  interest  bearing 
<br/>borrowings and derivative financial liability.  However, the excess of the financial assets of $107.8 
<br/>will not be sufficient to cover the financial liabilities for two to five years of $223.7 million and more 
<br/>than five years of $57 million. So the question there is, can the company provide details on how it is 
<br/>going to meet its future financial liabilities especially trade and other payables and interest bearing 
<br/>borrowings totalling $280.7 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also on note 9 there is mention of Receivables and Prepayments.  Receivables are those that 
<br/>owe  money  to  the  company  however  prepayments  in  receivable  is  confusing.    What  are  the 
<br/>prepayments which is $5.3 million and $5.2 million in 2019 as the company paid more than it should 
<br/>to consumers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  on  Note  11  there  is  mention  of  Capital  Spares  of  $5.1  million  which  include  an 
<br/>addition  of  $285,000  and  this  was  depreciated  by  $238,000.    If  the  company  is  maintaining  this 
<br/></span><span>capital shares for specialised equipment it should only maintain the minimum that is required for the 
<br/></span><span>equipment to operate uninterrupted.  The company should provide an explanation for maintaining 
<br/>high capital spares given that they are depreciated, there is a risk that the economic life of the spares 
<br/>is reduced if they are not used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the issues again from that Report.  Also in Note 11 on page 82 - Capital 
<br/>Works in Progress that increased from $89 million in 2019 to $118.9 million in 2020, indicating work 
<br/>on transformers and other projects which were largely responsible for the $30 million or so increase.  
<br/>The company might need to provide the basis of this project whether they meet the Government’s 5 
<br/>Year Development Plan, Strategic Priorities, SDGs and Investment in non-current Assets will mean 
<br/>a reduction in current assets.  Although the current ratios appear strong now, is the company prepared 
<br/>for possible liquidity risk? Those are some of the questions which arise from the financials.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Note 16, deferred income, it mentioned there $116 million related to various projects that 
<br/>have  not  been  completed.  This  includes  the  sum  of  $86.2  million  Government  Grant  for  rural 
<br/>electrification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>2154 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Capital Works Projects totalling $118.9 million, it is not clear whether the deferred income 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be used to complete the capital work in progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the questions which arise: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Can the company identify how much of the deferred income related to or will complete 
<br/>the capital works in progress?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  deferred  income  funds;  can  the  company  disclose  in  the  notes  of  the  financial 
<br/>statements additional information on the percentage of work completed and when this work 
<br/>will be completed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So those are some of the issues raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of interest is the rural electrification. We do commend the progress in that, however, prior to 
<br/>that there were some audits done on the project.  This rural electrification is done in cooperation with 
<br/>the Department of Energy.  Let me highlight some of the issues regarding the audit from that.  There 
<br/>is a need for more recruitment of staff, adequate training, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That again is an issue as already highlighted by Government on technical skills: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Application was not only supported by required documentation; 
<br/>Use of diesel generator schemes are not always utilised by beneficiaries; 
<br/>Approval for variations in parts, et cetera; 
<br/>Recoveries of community contribution could not be ascertained; and 
<br/>Records of maintenance and security of records is lacking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So those are some of the issues highlighted from that time but in the lead up to this report 
<br/>some have been rectified but some are ongoing and the follow-up audit also indicates that.  That is 
<br/>critical in terms of the implementation of rural electrification and the cooperation between EFL and 
<br/>the Department of Energy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, on the 5-20 year development we note there the targets under energy 3.1.2, there are 
<br/>various annual targets there from 2017 to 2022.  It would be useful if this table is attached to the end 
<br/>of this EFL Report and updates provided on the progress in terms of these specific targets.

<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  A  Point  of  Order.  The  honourable  Member  is  the  Member  of  this 
<br/></span><span>Committee. The question he is asking he should have asked during the presentation as a Member of 
<br/>the Committee.  This is bipartisan, he signed the Report.  He wasted the valuable time of this august 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Sir, my contribution is additional information for the Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and also it is very useful for the Committee as we move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Why did you endorse? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.-  I am opposing the Committee.  I am just providing additional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will continue the debate.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2155 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  by 
<br/>honourable Nath.  We set out from day one as a government to level the playing field of Fijian society, 
<br/>uplift the disadvantaged and protect the vulnerable.  That mission is only possible through access to 
<br/>reliable and affordable services everywhere in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provision of electricity to all Fijians in urban, rural and maritime areas by the year 2026 
<br/>is a target that was set out in the National Development Plan (NDP) and is being steadily achieved 
<br/>through grid extensions, rural electrifications projects and decentralised renewable energy sources 
<br/>such as mini-hydro, solar, hybrid biofuel diesel operated generators and wind systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is important Mr. Speaker, Sir, because as we extend energy access, we must also strive 
<br/>to  limit  the  carbon  footprint  of  meeting  Fiji’s  energy  demands.    Fiji  is  committed  to  achieve  net 
<br/>Global Emissions Offset (GEO) emission by 2050, in line with the commitments we are asking from 
<br/>the rest of the world.  Energy Fiji Limited’s vision of a sustainable energy sector is helping to provide 
<br/>clean and affordable energy solutions towards the goal of providing at least 90 percent of energy 
<br/>requirements through renewable of sources by 2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the company remains on track in its effort to identify potential projects for 
<br/></span><span>biomass solar, thermal and hydro power production.  It is also collaborating with independent power 
<br/></span><span>producers in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu to supply power to the grid.  Government in its quest to leave 
<br/>no one behind increased its budget for rural electrification projects for the five years leading up to 
<br/>2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In total $52.25 million was invested for rural electrification from 2015 to 2020 which saw the 
<br/>completion  of  435  projects  around  the  country  and  connected  11,838  households.    Through  rural 
<br/>electrification, EFL has increased its customer base by 3.3 percent to 202,580 accounts in 2020 which 
<br/>included industrial, commercial and domestic customers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government initiative is underpinned by the national goal of energising 
<br/>all  Fijians  by  2026.    As  a  result,  the  benefits  of  electricity  access  has  spread  to  most  Fijian 
<br/>communities, balance and inclusive socio-economic development was enhanced as electricity is the 
<br/>stimulator for economic growth and development and will ensure that every Fijian has equal footing 
<br/>to progress further in their development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  EFL’s  performance  during  the  initial  onset  of  the  pandemic  can  be 
<br/>termed as truly remarkable as it still managed to achieve a profit of $66.79 million after tax in 2020 
<br/></span><span>despite the impact of the pandemic, such as the closure of borders and the standstill of numerous 
<br/></span><span>tourism-related businesses which resulted in lower electricity demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  socially  responsible  company,  EFL  worked  with  Government  to  ensure  that  low 
<br/>income households still had access to electricity despite reduced working hours or job losses.  As 
<br/>part of Government’s COVID-19 economic stimulus package, subsidies totalling $6 million and $4.9 
<br/>million were paid by Government and EFL respectively towards monthly bill payment for eligible 
<br/>low income households. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the EFL through its 10 year tenure power development plan had outlined 
<br/>its forecasted and power generation scenarios up to 2026 for Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and 
<br/>Taveuni power systems and the investment plan required to implement the PDP.  In 2020, it was 
<br/>estimated  that  around  $2.4  billion  of  investments  is  required.    The  company  is  exploring  Public-
<br/>Private Partnership (PPP) with the private sector and on bordering of independent power producers 
<br/>to realise the achievements of the PDP.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  the  substantial  investment  required  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  foreign  investment  on  the 
<br/>renewable  energy  was  highly  encouraged  and  we  have  been  promoted  by  Government  given  the 
<br/>importance of the sector in stimulating the economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do concur with the Standing Committee’s recommendations and I applaud the hard work of 
<br/>the EFL staff, the Executive Management and Board over the years and the company’s remarkable 
<br/>achievements.  Based on this remark, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the motion before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the House.  I just stand up and thank EFL for the wonderful work they have been doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  at  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  have  seen  EFL  has 
<br/>become a very important partner in the work that we do. I have talked about in this august Parliament, 
<br/>the social determinants of health are also very important.  Why it is important to have roads, why it 
<br/>is  important  to  have  water,  why  it  is  important  to  have  electricity;  because  they  all  ultimately, 
<br/>indirectly affect health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have alluded to earlier, EFL has been working and break that speed all throughout Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>in trying to ensure that we energise all Fijians.  Our 220 facilities have also benefiting from it, so 
<br/></span><span>those, for example before they have to rely on the generator because of the availability of electricity, 
<br/>they have been able to attach themselves to the grid and we have been able to work it out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been on occasions also where we had to upgrade some of our 
<br/>facilities,  for  example,  the  Communicable  Disease  Lab  up  in  Tamavua  has  now  become  the  Fiji 
<br/>Centre for Disease Control.  It had some very specific, very complex machines set into it and at some 
<br/>stage, we had needed to have the necessary rebooting done with electricity in that area.  EFL was an 
<br/>important partner that came and supported us in doing this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  made  a  short  contribution  and  thanking  EFL,  thanking  the 
<br/>Management and I want to finish by saying to my </span><span>Koko,</span><span> honourable Kuridrani that this company is 
<br/>one  of  the  top  ten  companies  in  Japan.    It  is  actually  the  6th  company  in  Japan,  that  becomes  a 
<br/>shareholder of EFL. As you know that any shareholder does not necessarily mean that the company 
<br/>is not doing well. They are now bringing in their expertise, they are bringing in their professionalism, 
<br/>they are bringing in the efficiency, they are bringing in their consultancy in terms of their processes 
<br/>to be able to make EFL even a better company and I also support the work that they do with EFL.  I 
<br/>thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.K.  BHATNAGAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the 
<br/>Consolidated Review Report of Energy Fiji Limited 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports.  Firstly, I wish 
<br/>to congratulate EFL for continuing to provide the importance service, even in the back  of a  pandemic 
<br/>and even natural disasters such as </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, </span><span>TC Sarai </span><span>and</span><span> TC Yasa</span><span> that caused extensive damages 
<br/>but I thank the workers of EFL for effectively restoring  electricity, as fast as they could.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once households are connected to electricity, the first and most immediate 
<br/>benefit is more light - this enable children to spend more times studying in the evenings, give adults 
<br/>more time and flexibility for completing household chores and allows home based income generating 
<br/>activities such as shops to continue later into the evening. More study time for children can lead to 
<br/>higher school enrolment and great attainment.  According to an Article by UNDP in 2005, it says and 
<br/>I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“… electrical lighting reduces households dependents on alternative lighting sources, 
<br/>most  notably  kerosene,  they  were  lowering  smoke  and    indoor  air  pollution  and  the 
<br/>probability of various respiratory diseases.” 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-EFL 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  It is with this outlook, weighing the many benefits of electrification, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>Fijian  Government  has  targeted  to  achieve  100  percent  electrification  across  Fiji  by  2036.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this is an ambitious target but it is this Government that dares to set ambitious targets 
<br/>as such and injects the necessary resources, support and mechanisms to ensure we achieve this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the target will also line to achieving the Fijian Government’s 
<br/>commitment  to  have  a  more  healthy  and  educated  Fiji.    I  must  commend  EFL  for  its  wonderful 
<br/>achievements, well aligned to the Government’s plan.  Notably, with the Government increasing its 
<br/>budgetary allocation towards rural electrification for the past five years, EFL has also increased its 
<br/>resources internally, increased the number of external electrical contractors who can be deployed for 
<br/>the timely construction of this Rural Electrification Scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  consumer  growth  in  the  last  10  years,  the  average  growth  rate  is  around  3.16 
<br/>percent and currently stands at 209,146 as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2021.  Sir, EFL rising above the challenges 
<br/>of the pandemic achieved a financial profit of $66.79 million after tax in 2020, as compared to when 
<br/>audited profit tax of $63.74 million in 2019.  It goes to show that EFL was quick to expand on the 
<br/>various payments platforms available in the country and used these innovative methods to make it 
<br/>easy for consumers to make payments using alternative payment methods now available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to acknowledge the COVID-19 economic stimulus package, the 
<br/>Fijian  Government  and  EFL  committed  to  assist  low  income  households,  by  providing  a  subsidy 
<br/>towards  the  payment  of  the  monthly  electricity  bills,  just  as  our  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>mentioned.  The Fijian Government paid a total of COVID-19 discount of $6 million for the entire 
<br/>year 2020 and EFL paid a total COVID-19 discount of $4.9 million from April to December 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  congratulate  EFL  for  the  construction  of  some  70  rural 
<br/>electrification schemes in 2020.  The customer base was made up of 44,427 pre-pay customers as 
<br/>161,153 post pay customers compared to 37,517 pre-pay and 161,503 post pay customers in 2019.  
<br/>Well done EFL, many congratulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in the accessibility to power in the most remote areas has no 
<br/>doubt improved the quality of life of many, many people.  The study environment for school children 
<br/>has improved, communications have improved, extended hours for small businesses have improved, 
<br/>television which brings entertainment and information has improved, so overall, I must commend 
<br/>the work and the efforts of EFL and I thank every staff of EFL for their hard work, efforts and their 
<br/>achievements. I support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comments by the Committee is quite 
<br/>apparent in respect of the observations they have made.  I think honourable Tuisawau talked about 
<br/>the interesting project in Ovalau.  I think it is, indeed, a way forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pricing, of course, is critically important in this particular respect, as we saw that, to have 
<br/>the entire project under the Agro Photovoltaic Scheme would not have necessarily given them the 
<br/>rates.  So, now we have partially agro photovoltaic and the other part is just stand alone normal solar 
<br/>farm.  We are also looking currently at Taveuni to have the similar system, where we can have the 
<br/>agro photovoltaic project supplying electricity to the EFL grid, which will give EFL the capacity to 
<br/>provide more electricity, cheaper energy and at the same time, cleaner energy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Kuridrani brings me to this point, he has a very rudimentary understanding of 
<br/>companies, I think, which he displayed again.  If you have a company that is in trouble and you sell 
<br/>the shares, you will get very little price for it.  You will not get premium price.  So his understanding 
<br/>is this, “Oh if a company is not doing well, let us go off and sell it.”  So it would have been like his 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new  party  leader,  that  is  what  they  did,  they  went  and  sold  the  Fiji  Ships  and  Heavy  Industries 
<br/>Limited.  You have come out of the closet so to speak and you have now said that you are part of 
<br/>PAP.  That is what they did with the Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited.  They sold it to a $2 
<br/>company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular case, honourable Kuridrani failed to mention that FEA as it was known and 
<br/>it is now EFL, was corporatised.  Government took it through the various steps.  We then said that we are 
<br/>looking at divesting shares, FNPF, Sir, bought 20 percent of the shares for $206 million.  In less than two 
<br/>years, Sir, they sold the same number of shares to Sevens Pacific Pte Ltd for $236 million.  They made a 
<br/>whopping profit of $30 million in less than two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, they talked about FNPF not doing the rightful investments, this is the kind of investments 
<br/>they  are making.   Strategic investments, knowing  fully  well the value  of the  company  will increase, 
<br/>knowing  fully  well  that  Government  had  gone  out  to  international  tender,  we  had  roadshows 
<br/>internationally and during even the COVID period, we had people coming in, staying in the quarantine 
<br/>areas  and  doing  the  due  diligence.    The  company  that  has  bought  Sevens  Pacific  Pte  Ltd,  Sir,  is  a 
<br/>consortium of Chugoku Electric Company Ltd, which is one of the leading electricity companies in Japan 
<br/>which also has their international footprint and they have enormous knowledge, knowhow, technology, 
<br/></span><span>access to technology, access to technical people in the renewable energy space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Sir, the other shareholder is JBIC – Japan Bank of International Corporation.  Everyone 
<br/>knows, honourable Gavoka knows this, he has had some association with Japanese people in the past, he 
<br/>knows that Japanese companies, Sir, are very well-renowned for their ethics, are very well-renowned for 
<br/>their  adherence  to  environmental  standards,  are  very  well-renowned  in  terms  of  accountability  and 
<br/>transparency.  They like to play in a level playing field and one of the reasons also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 
<br/>again this is the lack of sophistication on the other side, is that, they would only participate in the market 
<br/>where they know that there is no political interference with the affairs of the company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major reasons why FEA for a number of decades had very weak balance sheets is 
<br/>because previous Governments and Ministers played around with the tariff rates.  So, it was election year, 
<br/>they would say reduce the tariff rates or do not increase the tariff rates even though they were paying 
<br/>higher rates of what we call the high density diesel because in those days, there was very high usage of 
<br/>high density diesel.  We still use it today but less, so they would play around with it, so as a result, FEA’s 
<br/>balance sheet was very weak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today,  Sir,  even  though  they  have  a  couple  of  hundred  million  dollars  of  loans,  there  is  no 
<br/></span><span>Government  guarantee.    Before  to  the  tune  of  nearly  $400  million,  FEA  subsequently  EFL  was 
<br/></span><span>Government-guaranteed.  Today, none of the loans of EFL is Government-guaranteed.  So you see they 
<br/>do not understand how balance sheets work and as a result of that, Sir, we are now seeing a lot more 
<br/>investment.  What he is talking about how they are able to fund their capital investment through their own 
<br/>cash flows, yes because they have got a strong balance sheet, because it is being run properly.  It is not 
<br/>being interfered by some Ministers picking up the phone and saying, “Do this, do that or hire my cousin, 
<br/>my uncle or my aunty.” No one does that.  That is what used to happen.   We had mates running the show 
<br/>with absolutely zero knowledge of how to run an energy company, how to actually have professional 
<br/>services in an energy company.  So that is one of the reasons.  They think that you are making profit this 
<br/>year, let us continue that way.  No, there is enormous potential for it to grow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Prime Minister has announced, we need to go net zero emissions by 2050.  We  
<br/>need to get there.  Viti Levu has about 60 percent of energy generated through hydro – Monasavu but if 
<br/>there is a drought (we have climate change), you could have electricity not being generated by hydro.  
<br/>We have to rely more heavily on diesel, so we need to look for more renewable energy sources.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2159 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need more renewable energy sources in Vanua Levu, in Taveuni, in Ovalau, in Kadavu and 
<br/>just at the awards night on Friday night and I would like to thank once again the staff who were there.  
<br/>You could see the camaraderie, the happiness amongst the staff because they also now get rewarded on 
<br/>PMS – Performance Management Systems, where individual staff are all assessed.  You perform, you 
<br/>are actually recognised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just at that function, there were about five or seven Japanese experts that came 
<br/>from Japan.  They are here, currently, looking at various opportunities whether it is biomass, hydrogen, 
<br/>hydro, mini hydro schemes or standalone schemes, they are looking at all of those options and how they 
<br/>can invest because for them, it is also a matter of pride to be able to help Fiji to achieve its net zero 
<br/>emissions.  So, these are the kind of strategic partners we wish to participate in and are looking for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  wanted  to  make  is  in  respect  of  that  was  the 
<br/>independence of FCCC and that is some of the reason why they are also quite keen because FCCC 
<br/>is independent, it does its own assessment.  Should they tomorrow make an application to say “look 
<br/>the price of diesel has gone through the roof, we have not increased the tariff rate for the past four-
<br/>five years, we need an increase”  FCCC would carry out its own investigation, own public hearing, 
<br/>own public consultation, they will come up with the tariff rate and even though it is Elections this 
<br/></span><span>year or early next year, FCCC will be able to do its job, we would not interfere and that is the reason 
<br/></span><span>why they have confidence and that is how  you create a conducive environment for private sector 
<br/>investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wish to make is that, which is critically important 
<br/>is in respect of climate change.  We had just in terms of restoration cost the capital expenditure, we 
<br/>for example as a government if we say, “we need to connect that village” and to connect that village 
<br/>there  may  be  only  20  people  living  in  that  village  and  to  connect  electricity  to  that  village  may 
<br/>actually cost half-a-million dollars.  We do not expect EFL to go and do the connection because it 
<br/>does not make commercial cents for them.  The government funds them, they tell us what it is, and 
<br/>they tell us what the cost is and we through the budget, which this Parliament approves, we pay for 
<br/>them and as announced in the last Budget, Sir, they also now do the black wiring, and in other words 
<br/>they do the entire contract.  So, we pay for it and they do it, once it is connected the assets is theirs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  tomorrow  there  is  a  cyclone  the  post  falls  down,  it  is  not  our  responsibility  but  EFL’s 
<br/>responsibility because now it is EFL’s asset.  So, that is the restoration cost and as we have seen 
<br/>during </span><span>TC Yasa, </span><span>the honourable Minister for Natural Disaster Management, the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Infrastructure will tell you and all the other Ministers, the honourable Prime Minister was there 
<br/></span><span>that some of the areas, Sir, the electricity posts were up, they went down, they were put back up, they 
<br/></span><span>went down, they were put back up, they went down, they were put back up, they went down again.  
<br/>That is the level of work that is required by EFL and we have very capable people working in EFL, 
<br/>high voltage linesmen and women who work on those lines and in fact, Sir, they do their work so 
<br/>well and a lot of them are being poached by New Zealand because New Zealanders do not want to 
<br/>do the job that is the kind of what we call change in professional preferences that is taking place and 
<br/>Fiji is providing a feed for this people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this is why it is critically important that the company does well, the company rewards it 
<br/>staff and unfortunately, honourable Kuridrani’s new party member made a statement outside when 
<br/>the PMS was given;  “oh! These people are useless” the electricity comes down all the time then the 
<br/>Party  leader  disassociated  himself  saying,  “that  is  her  own  personal  comment,  not  the  party’s 
<br/>comment”.    Unfortunately  for  him,  the  hypocrisy  was  that  the  worried  comment,  he  did  not 
<br/>disassociate himself from it that is hypocrisy that is where you are going to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wish to make that the adoption of technology…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  A  point  of  Order  that  the  honourable  Minister  is  misleading 
<br/>Parliament.  I have not confirmed to join any other political party.  He is wrong in saying that I am 
<br/>joining PAP, I have not confirmed anything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  You  are  only  joining  the  party  that  is  going  to  win  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, before I forget, the shares in EFL at the moment is 51 
<br/>percent owned by the Fijian Government, 44 percent owned by the Sevens Pacific Pte. Limited and 
<br/>the reason why they actually called it Sevens because Fiji won the Sevens in the Olympics and that 
<br/>is why they call the company Sevens that is the consortium.  The balance of the 5 percent shares 
<br/></span><span>owned by ordinary Fijians.  If your household income is $30,000 or less, you get 250 shares.  If your 
<br/></span><span>household earns more than $30,000 a year, you get 150 shares, ex gratia in other words free, anyone 
<br/>can apply for it.  It is applicable to any Fijian that has electricity connectivity that is how we are 
<br/>empowering ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I also wish to make is the adoption of technology.  Again the point we like 
<br/>to highlight, Sir, is this - as I mentioned earlier on before lunch, one of the reasons why we are able to 
<br/>adopt  and  roll  out  so  many  services  through  M-PAiSA,  MyCash  and  internet  banking  (all  of  those 
<br/>platforms) is that we now have people who have access to this technology, and the companies are now 
<br/>adopting this technology.  If tomorrow we go out here drive down the street you get booked for speeding 
<br/>you pay the fine using your phone.  You do not have to queue up at Land Transport Authority (LTA). If 
<br/>you want to pay your electricity bill you can pay it through M-PAiSA or MyCash, and internet banking.   
<br/>This is making services a lot more friendlier and making services accessible to ordinary Fijians.  We 
<br/>would like to thank EFL for those and there is lot more that they are planning to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that was also highlighted - the honourable Prime Minister has covered that in 
<br/>respect of renewable energy and other Members have covered that too - we would like to of course thank 
<br/>EFL for the enormous amount of work that has been carried out by them notwithstanding the fact that 
<br/></span><span>there  is  criticism.    One  last  point  I  would  like  to  make,  Sir,  is  that  we  need  to  ensure  that  we  have 
<br/></span><span>redundancies.  At the moment when there is a cyclone you have the main line coming from Monasavu 
<br/>down  to  Vuda.    If  somewhere  along  the  bush  the  line  gets  broken,  there  is  no  other  connectivity. 
<br/>Assessments have been done in order for us to actually build a redundancy line, it will cost tens of millions 
<br/>of dollars and that is what we are talking to EFL about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way as we announced in the Budget, the Budget has been presented and approved by 
<br/>Parliament, we have allocated a million dollars to have a fibre-optic cable, a different company, land in 
<br/>the Western Division of Fiji.  If God forbid, as I mentioned earlier on, if you have a volcano or some 
<br/>other disaster that the Southern Cross cable which lands in Vatuwaqa, gets blown out of action we will 
<br/>be cut off from the rest of the world.  All these things that we take for granted - sitting here tweeting and 
<br/>all those sort of things and making phone calls to people - we will not be able to do.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Compliance Audit Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonga was out of action for nearly over a week. Even the satellite phones were very hard to 
<br/>connect. So, we are building redundancy  and  we  have two lines.  In  the  same  way  we need to build 
<br/>redundancy  in  the  EFL  connectivity,  and  that  is  one  of  the  major  projects.  We  are  looking  at  how 
<br/>Government can collaborate with EFL shareholders to build redundancies so we get less downtime as far 
<br/>as electricity connectivity is concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one I would like to make is that EFL has now become such a model in respect of the way 
<br/>it has been managed and controlled, and the forward looking positioning it is doing in as far as renewable 
<br/>energy  is  concerned,  is  that  other  countries  in  the  Pacific  are  also  interested.    In  the  same  way  that 
<br/>Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited (ATH) in the recent past, has acquired shares in countries like 
<br/>Samoa.  It is looking at Solomon Islands and various other companies because of the way ATH is being 
<br/>run.  We are looking also at EFL organisations like ADB where they are helping countries like Solomon 
<br/>Islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electricity rate in Fiji, Sir - domestic rate is 33 cents a unit. In countries like Solomon Islands and 
<br/>various other countries in the Pacific it is $1.50, $1.40, $1.70 a unit.  So, they are looking at how they can 
<br/>replicate  that  model  in  those  countries  and  we  have  enormous  potential  for  EFL  to  provide  bigger 
<br/>footprints and share its knowledge and wisdom with the rest of the other Pacific Island countries.  I would 
<br/></span><span>like to take this opportunity once again, Sir, to thank the CEO of EFL, the hardworking staff and of course 
<br/></span><span>the Board that is currently overseeing the work carried out by EFL.  I support the motion on the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  no  further  comment  but  I  thank  all  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members for their contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed.
