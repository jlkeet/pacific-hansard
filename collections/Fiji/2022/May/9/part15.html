<div><span>EIA for the Proposed Naval Base 
<br/>(Question No. 97/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  inform 
<br/>Parliament  whether  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  has  been  carried  out  for  the 
<br/>proposed naval base in Lami? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, the honourable Member has jumped 
<br/>the gun and demonstrated her lack of knowledge about environmental matters.  If someone sits down 
<br/>and  has  a  </span><span>talanoa</span><span>  and  says,  “I  want  to  construct  a  hotel  at  Denarau”,  that  does  not  mean  that 
<br/>immediately the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) needs to be undertaken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people think about  a particular project  in  a particular area, acquires that 
<br/></span><span>area, buys that specific plot of land, does the architectural drawings, lodges it with Town and Country 
<br/>Planning, the Town and Country Planning then sends it to the Department of Environment, they then 
<br/>apply for the screening  application, and the Department of Environment  then determines whether 
<br/>there is a need for an EIA.  If there is a need then a terms of references is drafted and given to the 
<br/>investor, and the investor then hires an EIA consultant to undertake an EIA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this case, they have not even acquired the land.  What is this EIA thing 
<br/>about?  I am asking the honourable Member, whenever she stands up in  Parliament to talk about 
<br/>environment, talk to us, and get some understanding about the environment matters then come and 
<br/>take the parliamentary time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  architectural  or  the  artist’s 
<br/>impression of the building is already out.  I am going to ask the Honourable Minister through you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, does he know the area in question?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I want to tell the honourable Member the 
<br/>processes that are outlined.  Firstly, they need to acquire the property, then draw the architectural 
<br/>drawings and lodge it to the Town and Country Planning.  The Town and Country Planning will then 
<br/>ask  them  to  go  and  apply  for  screening  for  EIA.    We  will  then  determine  whether  their  EIA  is 
<br/>required.  They have not gone to the first step of acquiring the place.

<div><span>Status of the Embryo Transfer Technology 
<br/>(Question No. 98/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/>Parliament on the status of the Embryo Transfer Technology undertaken by the Ministry since 
<br/>2018? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable O’ Connor and the 
<br/>honourable  Maharaj  for  getting  this  question  across  -  a  critical  component  of  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture’s Strategic Development Plan 2019-2023, and I urge honourable Members from the other 
<br/>side to read this Strategic Plan because a number of other questions that are emanating from the other 
<br/>side  demonstrate  clear  lack  of  understanding  about  the  vision  and  the  strategic  objective  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture.  Had they got some time to get a copy of our Strategic Plan, which is on our 
<br/>homepage, I think will make sense if you can put better questions across the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would want to rehabilitate our livestock sector.  Over the  years, the 
<br/>livestock sector had been suffering due to loss of genetic attributes.  You name it, whether it is beef 
<br/>cattle, dairy cattle, goat and sheep, over the years due to inbreeding, we have lost the original genetic 
<br/>traits of the breeds that we have.  There are very few farms, you will see, have their original breeds.  
<br/>The Ministry of Agriculture do hold original genetic materials, but when it goes to the farm, then 
<br/>again the farmers do not change the breeder - breeder bull or sheep, goat, fowl or duck.  There is a 
<br/></span><span>lot of inbreeding happening all the time and they are for the loose of genetic material. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also what we would want to do is to bring in new improve genetic material.  
<br/>Bringing of livestock takes years but unfortunately, we cannot bring in live animals because some of 
<br/>the diseases that are there from the supply countries, we do not have it.  My Ministry is very particular 
<br/>to ensure that to take advantage of the island of that nature of our country, we ensure that unless we 
<br/>are 100 percent sure and if there is no other alternative then we take certain measures to ensure that 
<br/>that particular animal or plants species been brought does not bring in that particular diseases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, embryo transfer is a means of bringing in the original genetic material 
<br/>minus the diseases.  So, basically embryo transfer is where you have the develop fertilise egg into an 
<br/>embryo in a  test tube you bring it down and then you plant it in the receiver in this case when the 
<br/>cow gets pregnant and gives birth you have this original breed of that particular animal or whatever 
<br/>the breed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular programme started from 2018 where embryos were brought 
<br/>in from Australia through a funding from the Australian government for different breeds of livestock, 
<br/>dairy cattle breed, beef cattle breed which I am going to explain.  So, the first stage of the embryo 
<br/></span><span>development was actually in Australia where they got the fertile eggs, put it into the embryo and it 
<br/></span><span>was brought over to Fiji with full bio security compliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The breeds that were brought was for dairy cattle, so it was special high yielding breed for 
<br/>dairy cattle and beef cattle – Senepol for beef cattle, Swiss Brown for dairy and Drought Master for 
<br/>beef cattle.  It is carefully selected for its good performance in terms of heat stress ability to withstand 
<br/>high heat stress, growth and development in yield carcass content, reproduction and meat quality.  
<br/>These were the criteria that was utilised for selecting genetic material for this particular four breeds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are carefully processing the plan of releasing these breeds to ensure that 
<br/>we pass it to those farms which are tuberculosis and brucellosis free. It is no use passing the genetic 
<br/>material or a live animal that we have spent so much of money to pass it to a farm which will again 
<br/>get infected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, simultaneously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of work being undertaken for the first time 
<br/>ever where the Ministry has four full time qualified veterinarians.  They have never had that number 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of veterinarian leading a team of our livestock, officers to test and undertake the required work to 
<br/>determine whether a farm can be classified as tuberculosis and brucellosis free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Australian Reproductive Technology Company was hired through the 
<br/>Australian Government grant to work with the Ministry for this particular process and also to develop 
<br/>local capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to establish an elite nuclear head or appropriately adopted cattle in Fiji. 300 
<br/>embryos  were  imported  for  beef  and  dairy  breed  as  part  of  the  initial  programme.    These  three 
<br/>embryos were then transferred into local synchronised cattle in Government stations in four phases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 122 calves were born with the embryo transfer technology with the success rate of 
<br/>about 40 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, generally the success rate around the world for embryo transfer 
<br/>is around 40 to 60 within the range.  To date, there are 64 purebred Senepol, 42 purebred Brown 
<br/>Swiss, so Senepol for beef cattle and Brown Swiss for dairy cattle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Breeding  Centre  has  also  been  established  and  it  is  expected  to  be 
<br/>completed  this  year.    With  the  completion  of  the  Breeding  Centre  we  want  to  do  this  in  our 
<br/></span><span>Programme here in Fiji.  The embryos are easier to transport and implant in cows outside Vitilevu 
<br/></span><span>rather than transporting the whole animal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have restrictions of transferring animals within Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because certain 
<br/>areas are TB free, for example Koro Island.  Our first test is a representative sample of cattle in Koro 
<br/>Island which reveals that they are TB free and we want to maintain it that way.  We are now putting 
<br/>stringent measures on any animal movement into Koro Island Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we want 
<br/>Koro Island to remain TB free.  If that is the case, we can then also have another standby place where 
<br/>we can put in these exotic breeds that we have got so that in any case and at any time, if these breeds 
<br/>get infected at one of our stations, we have got backup plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  continuing  process  and  the  second  set  of  embryo  transfers  was 
<br/>recently completed in April using Wagyu and Drought Master so we are getting these two other beef 
<br/>cattle breed.  A total of 40 embryos were implanted in our local recipients at two government stations 
<br/>and we are expecting that at least we will meet that range of 40 percent to 60 percent in our success 
<br/>rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ministry has developed a nucleus head for this beef cattle breed and we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would want to disseminate them in the following ways, namely;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>The breeder bulls be given to TB free farms; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Embryo transplants so at the end of this year we can do our own embryos in test tubes and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implant it in the cows throughout Fiji which is easier to transport; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Artificial insemination -  the only issue for artificial insemination is that it will be what you 
<br/>call in genetic terms “F1” meaning we will be taking the breeder bull sperm and planting it 
<br/>in a cow so it would not be the pure breed but at least it will be 50:50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are well on track in terms of improving the genetic materials and we 
<br/>have plans for other embryos for example we are doing the similar thing with the goats and sheep 
<br/>but not through embryo transfer but through dissemination of breeder, breeder sheep and breeder 
<br/>Boer goat.

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1207 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister said that they are on 
<br/>track and yet the conception rate is 40 percent but worldwide it is 60 percent. What is the ministry 
<br/>doing to be able to raise the level from 40 percent to 60 percent? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the range worldwide is 40 percent to 60 
<br/>percent and the conception is affected by a number of factors for example the weather condition, the 
<br/>heat, the animal stress, et cetera.  We have one of the top experts from Australia working with our 
<br/>team in undertaking the embryo transplanting.  I spoke to the expert about a month ago at Koronivia 
<br/>Research Station and he said, “Look you are fortunate that you are within this rate, there are countries 
<br/>where the success rate is 30 percent, 25 percent”.  So, I think we are doing extremely well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members  this  Question  was  supposed  to  be  asked  by 
<br/>honourable  O’Connor but he is indisposed.  Then it was supposed to be asked by honourable Joseph 
<br/>Nand  but  the  honourable  Whip  came  to  the  rescue  because  I  could  not  locate  honourable  Joseph 
<br/>Nand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members before we move on, for the purpose of complying with Standing Orders 
<br/>with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a 
<br/></span><span>Suspension Motion.
