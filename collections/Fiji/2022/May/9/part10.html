<div><span>Standing Committee on Economic Affairs - New Appointment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  please  be  informed  that  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  115(1),  the 
<br/>honourable Sachida Nand is hereby appointed to the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs.  He 
<br/>has  replaced  honourable  George  Vegnathan  who  will  now  focus  on  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Social Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hon. Niko Nawaikula’s Parliamentary Seat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, at this juncture, I will now address Parliament on the issue relating to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the seat of honourable Nawaikula.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 63(1)(d) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji expressly provides, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1)   The seat of a member of Parliament becomes vacant if the Member - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)   ceases  to  have  the  right  to  be  nominated  as  a  candidate  for  election  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament under section 56;”  of the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Section 56(2) of the Constitution lists the criteria of who may be a candidate for an 
<br/>election to Parliament and </span><span>inter alia</span><span> provides under paragraph (g) that a person may be a candidate only 
<br/>if  the  person  has  not,  at  any  time  during  the  eight  years  immediately  before  being  nominated,  been 
<br/>convicted of any offence under any law for which the maximum penalty is a term of imprisonment of 12 
<br/>months or more.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, since honourable Naiwaikula has been convicted with one count of tendering 
<br/>false information to a public servant under section 201(a) of the Crimes Act 2009 and one count of 
<br/>obtaining  financial  advantage  under  section  326(1)  of  the  Crimes  Act  2009,  he  is,  therefore, 
<br/>disqualified  from  being  a  candidate  in  the  2022  Election.    This  is  particularly  so  given  that  the 
<br/>maximum penalty for the offences that he had been convicted of is a term of imprisonment of five 
<br/>years and ten years respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, honourable Naiwaikula’s seat in Parliament has become vacant pursuant to Section 
<br/>63(1)(d) of the Constitution which, in this instant, became vacant on the date of his conviction being 
<br/>3</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A written notification of this was provided to the honourable Niko Naiwaikula on Friday, 6</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span><span>May, 2022; and the same was conveyed to the honourable Leader of the Opposition on Saturday, 7</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>May, 2022. Pursuant  to  section 20(1) of the Electoral  Act  2014, the Chairperson of the Electoral 
<br/>Commission has been notified accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
