<div><span>FIJI COMMERCE COMMISSION 2016-2017 AND FIJIAN COMPETITION  
<br/>AND CONSUMER COMMISSION 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Commerce 
<br/>Commission  2016-2017  and  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  2017- 
<br/>2018 Annual Reports which was tabled on 8</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its 
<br/>findings and recommendation on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Commerce Commission 
<br/>2016-2017 and the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission 2017-2018 Annual Reports earlier 
<br/>this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC)  plays  a  significant  role  in 
<br/>protecting consumer rights and promoting fair competition amongst Fijian businesses.  The period 
<br/>of report under review carried great significance to the organisation and it was the year when the Fiji 
<br/>Commerce Commission was officially rebranded as Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended the team  from  FCCC for successfully launching its five-year 
<br/>Strategic  Plan.    The  Committee  made  note  of  various  activities  undertaken  by  FCCC  during  the 
<br/>period under review which included stakeholders’ engagement, ongoing organisational restructure 
<br/></span><span>and greater inspection, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also noted that despite ongoing various awareness sessions, complaints were 
<br/>still being received by FCCC on various issues such as trader non-compliance and landlord and tenant 
<br/>issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee believes that the formulation of more effective webinar strategy, including 
<br/>collaborations  with  various  stakeholders  such  as  Citizens  Constitutional  Forum  (CCF),  Financial 
<br/>Intelligence  Unit  (FIU),  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  (MCTTT), 
<br/>Department  of  Co-operatives  and  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  as  well  as  preparing  and 
<br/></span><span>disseminating  information  packages  regularly  for  all  new  and  existing  businesses  on  various 
<br/></span><span>requirements under the Act would be beneficial.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, furthermore, the Committee is aware that FCCC initiated its work towards the 
<br/>proposed draft Landlord and Tenants Bill.  Given the continuous issues surrounding rent complaints, 
<br/>the Committee recommends that stakeholders’ consent be thoroughly considered, and look forward 
<br/>to the progress of the proposed Bill.  Mr. Speaker, with those few comments, I request Parliament to 
<br/>debate on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to make a few comments on the 2016-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 and 2017-2018 FCCC Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FCCC in its written submissions to the Committee, apart from stating its 
<br/>vision and mission in respect of the years, of course, which I believe is part of the organisation, stated 
<br/>its values, and  I  quote:   “Professionalism,  responsibility, commitment,  honesty,  respect,  trust  and 
<br/>transparency.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  although  I  expected  the  Committee  to  look  at  those  values  and  whether  the 
<br/>FCCC, as an independent organisation, upheld those values, the mission objective and values are part 
<br/>of most organisations.  They, at the outset, raise and follow those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, Mr. Speaker, examined the Reports based on the submissions and the SDGs 
<br/>which FCCC subscribes to.  But those values, Sir, become extremely important if one is independent, 
<br/>apolitical,  an  impartial  organisation  or  authority  funded  by  taxpayers.    It  is  not  just  fulfilling  the 
<br/>organisation’s role as an effective watchdog, and we all understand that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCCC  has  an  effective  role  as  a  watchdog.    They  receive  complaints,  they  deal  with 
<br/>those, they have certain powers to take people to court to enforce some of those watchdog roles but, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  an  independent  organisation,  it  is  about  having  a  very  ethical,  apolitical, 
<br/>transparent, honest and trustworthy behaviour.  It is extremely important because it is an independent 
<br/>organisation, and I will explain to you, Sir, why it is very important for the overall economy as well, 
<br/>because those values are very important.  It is not about - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the organisation behaving like a politician or elements within the organisation because this 
<br/>report refers to 2017 to 2018 and 2016 to 2017; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rubbishing general election initiatives and policies contained in a manifesto of a political 
<br/></span><span>party;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>falsely  warning  of  a  mass  closure  of  business  and  some  of  you  would  remember  an 
<br/>economic collapse if policies designed to reduce the cost of living or reduce the cost of 
<br/>basic food items are implemented by removing the VAT or reducing duties;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>justifying the exorbitant rise in the price of processed sugar by saying it will have positive 
<br/>implications on health and an increase in income of cane growers by $17 million, without 
<br/>any explanation on how this will happen;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appearing on national television in budget debates from an independent organisation to 
<br/>praise  the  Government’s  budget  or  to  praise  the  Government,  it  is  supposed  to  be  an 
<br/>independent organisation; and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>making an about turn three-and-a-half years later and applaud Government’s move to zero 
<br/>rate or remove VAT from essential foods and basic items, thereby, making one stand three-
<br/>and-a-half years ago actually a lie, because that is what FCCC did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to quote the FCCC’s CEO in what he said in 2018, because this is important.  It is not 
<br/>in this report of the Committee but we did not expect it to be.  I am surprised that my colleagues in 
<br/>the Opposition side did not raise that.  The CEO told the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> in 2018, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“My comment spoke to the lack of economic understanding behind the question.  It 
<br/>would be impossible to implement such a radical and unrealistic policy without grinding 
<br/>the Fijian economy to a halt and force the Fijian businesses to close the doors.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We have a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request the honourable Member to please read from 
<br/>these books, not where he is quoting from, because I initiated that we should be debating on the Fiji 
<br/>Commerce Commission 2016-2017 and Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission 2017-2018 
<br/>Annual Report which is misleading Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am exactly talking about … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have the floor but you heard the Point of Order, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so please consider it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that that was irrelevant, I am still 
<br/>talking about the 2017-2018 Report and what the activities of the FCCC are so I do not know where 
<br/>this Point of Order is coming from.  The same was reported by </span><span>FBC</span><span> news and we are not surprised 
<br/>because we all know what </span><span>FBC</span><span> and the Government dragged funded by the taxpayers do.  Only last 
<br/>week,  during  the  occasion  of  the  World  Press  Freedom  Day,  we  said  that  there  is  no  place  for  a 
<br/>partisan media and media which parrot what the Government does instead of amplifying the voice of 
<br/>the people without fear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually quite as simple as this - if  you are heading an independent 
<br/>organisation that is supposedly independent  and if you  indulge in politics then where is the trust, 
<br/>where is the confident in the organisation from people who are looking at that organisation to do the 
<br/></span><span>right thing and if people want to do that you know they should resign, join politics and fight elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, but more important about this independent organisation (and I do not envy the 
<br/>role  of  the  FCCC  Chief  Executive  Officer)  because  some  of  these  people  who  are  heading  this 
<br/>independent organisation are actually working a tight role.  I know why because they have a brief 
<br/>from the Government not to do the job but to malign the Opposition, Mr. Speaker and that is what 
<br/>they do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is true and I have provided evidence of some of these 
<br/></span><span>people indulging in politics at the insistence of the Government.  Once that happens, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>you know out goes the professionalism, out goes the independence, out goes the ethical behaviour 
<br/>that  one  expects  from  independent  organisations,  I  mean  same  with  some  of  the  Permanent 
<br/></span><span>Secretaries, recently, the Permanent Sectary for the Ministry of Economy.

<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1159 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  decorum  about  Permanent  Secretaries  if  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries  are  providing  response  from  politicians  to  the  Ministers  their  job  is  to  advise  the 
<br/>Ministers, the Ministers make that statement. They do not get the Permanent Secretaries to attack the 
<br/>politicians like me or anyone else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  and  you  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  in  the  past  Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries  actually  refused  to  be  used  by  Ministers  to  make  political  statements  against  the 
<br/>Opposition. They left it to the politicians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, there is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is beating around the bush.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>request the honourable Member to stick to the report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I actually feel sorry for the Chairperson of the 
<br/>Committee  because  I  do  not  think  he  has  the  independence  to  actually  run  the  Committee 
<br/>independently and that is why I think he does not have any idea of what the Committee or what the 
<br/>organisation ought to be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me, Mr. Speaker, move on to a very important point about …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  request  him  to  withdraw  the  statement.  He  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>challenging the independence of the Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Professor Prasad, you have heard the three points of orders so, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please, stick to the contents of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let me just continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- With respect to the role of the FCCC, I was just reading the 
<br/>copy of the recent  Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD) report by the  International  Finance 
<br/>Corporation (IFC) and on Page 15, they talked about the role of the FCCC and I hope that when the 
<br/>Committee looks at the next report, whenever that may be, that they need to look at some of those 
<br/></span><span>issues.  The Report says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Since  the  enactment  of  the  Commerce  Commission  Decree  of  2010,  price  controls 
<br/>decisions  made  by  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC)  are  no 
<br/></span><span>longer subject to judicial review, undermining the ability of private sector firms to contest 
<br/></span><span>price controls when necessary – the role of FCCC should not be to act as price regulators, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>1160 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which should rest with line ministries or sector regulators.  While the Government of Fiji 
<br/>has increasingly recognized that competition regulation needs to be reformed and some 
<br/>positive steps have been taken by the FCCC (e.g, adoption of a more transparent formula 
<br/>to  adjust  electricity  prices),  price  controls  need  to  be  rationalized  further,  based  on  a 
<br/>comprehensive assessment.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many other issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that FCCC, as an independent organisation, 
<br/>needs to look at and on this note I also want to say that we still have not got the Code of Conduct 
<br/>legislation.    We  know  it  has  been  delayed  unnecessarily  and  the  lack  of  the  Code  of  Conduct 
<br/>legislation Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us free some of these independent organisations and those who head 
<br/>these  independent  organisations  to  actually  astray  from  their  neutral  roles  as  a  watchdog,  as 
<br/>upholding those values of transparency, accountability and being apolitical. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, this organisation is very important. It is also very important from the 
<br/>point  of  view  of  creating  confidence  in  the  economy.    This  Report  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  full  of 
<br/>anecdotes and I hope that the Government and the Minister for Commerce will read this thoroughly 
<br/>because it does point out the many of the things that we have been talking about in this House to 
<br/>ensure that there is trust, confidence, efficiency in the way these organisations operate and there is a 
<br/>lot about outsourcing, efficiency and this is an important organisation, I know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at it from an economic point of view, the role of the FCCC is extremely important 
<br/>and  whatever  they  do  apart  from  the  watchdog,  the  way  in  which  they  conduct  themselves  will 
<br/>determine whether they can create confidence and trust in the economy Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So it is 
<br/>absolutely important that we maintain the independence and the apolitical nature of these independent 
<br/>organisations and more so organisations like FCCC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last contribution by honourable Professor Prasad, 
<br/>I think belongs in a soapbox in Hyde Park where he can air all his grievances be whatever they are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  is  standing  here  talking  about  the  FCCC  and  questioning  its 
<br/>independence  and  actually  questioning  its  impartiality  but  might  I  remind  him  that  he  has  never 
<br/>actually  contributed  to  anything  with  respect  to  submissions  that  have  ever  been  asked  by  the 
<br/>Commerce Commission Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am reliably informed … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is too above all of that …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  He  chooses  a  moment  like  in  Parliament  to  come  and  talk  about  his 
<br/>grievances that he may have with the CEO, this is not the forum for it Sir.  We are actually standing 
<br/>here debating the Competition and Consumer Commission Annual Reports twice. The author of the 
<br/>motion is asking to stick to the Report, he should. As I had said, Sir and just in brief, he probably 
<br/>belongs in Hyde Park as you know, Sir, on the soapbox. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a matter of fact in the words of my friend, sitting next to me - absolute 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely, it is a very big hog.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Yes.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  what  I  understand  also  even  at  the 
<br/>Committee level if he has got a problem not being able to contribute maybe he should go and see the 
<br/>Opposition, not us.  They do not seem to get on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji 
<br/>Commerce  Commission  2016-2017  Annual  Report  and  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer 
<br/>Commission 2017-2018 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just in brief, Sir, the FCCC was established, I think Professor Prasad should listen to this,  to 
<br/>promote effective competitive and an informed market whilst encouraging fair trade in markets and 
<br/>protecting customers and businesses from restrictive practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, as the Minister responsible for FCCC, I am actually pleased 
<br/>to note that the FCCC has unqualified audited financial reports, so there goes his theory about it, 
<br/>when he talked about impartiality and independence.  That basically means that their books were 
<br/>prepared  in  a  true  and  fair  manner  and  this  gives  everybody  a  great  deal  of  confidence  in  our 
<br/>independent regulator, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Independent!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the recommendations put forward by the Committee in the 
<br/>two Annual Reports, FCCC has actually taken note of these and actually strengthened those areas.  
<br/>Actually, FCCC was rebranded in 2017 to set a clear vision and align its objectives to be consistent 
<br/>with its functions - which is an independent enforcement agency.  The rebranding portrays the image 
<br/>of a multisector regulator and that is what FCCC aims to emphasise on.  Mr. Speaker, simply meaning 
<br/>not only on basic food items and fuel but also various areas that are pertaining to consumer protection 
<br/>and competition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along with their rebranding, Mr. Speaker, the FCCC has also developed and modernised their 
<br/>strategic plan and with the development of FCCC’s strategic plan, it paves the way for their direction 
<br/>as an organisation and enable them to direct resources towards the fulfilment of the functions in a 
<br/>conducive manner, Sir, rather than just being responsible for enforcement, it has now become the 
<br/>business friendly agency with constant awareness and advocacies that are carried out throughout the 
<br/>country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the changes that we actually witness today are very encouraging, with the 
<br/></span><span>traders  and  consumers  being  aware  of  their  rights  and  their  responsibilities.    This  has  resulted  in 
<br/>FCCC’s ability to build consumer confidence by making information readily available to the public 
<br/>so they understand what they need to be aware of when buying products and services.   We have also 
<br/>seen FCCC on the ground undertaking rigorous spot checks on products and to promote protection 
<br/>and  closely  monitor  price  orders.      This  is  their  core  business,  Sir.    Taking  precedence  from  the 
<br/>COVID-19  pandemic,  the  organisation  was  fully  committed  to  ensure  that  traders  were  actually 
<br/>compliant by way of conducting monitoring and also surveillance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I must also acknowledge the FCCC’s collaboration with the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry, in actually rolling out the COVID safe ambassador role which included creating awareness 
<br/></span><span>and conducting inspections on COVID safe protocols for various business segments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  data  is  actually  vital  in  better    planning  and  consumer  protection  and 
<br/></span><span>competition  policies  and  as  such,  the  Ministry  actually  takes  notes  of  the  Standing  Committee’s 
<br/></span><span>recommendation in this particular area.  For the betterment, Mr. Speaker, for ordinary Fijians and to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide affordable and safe housing also, the FCCC safeguards the rights of landlords and tenants, 
<br/>to ensure equal consideration for both parties and to have a balanced approach in the rental market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FCCC  and  other  statutory  authorities  such  as  the  Consumer  Council  also  have  been 
<br/>receiving a spike of grievances from individuals either from a landlord or from a tenant on rental 
<br/>issues and in 2019, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recorded about 700 cases relating to rent issues.  This is a 
<br/>concerning issue and our landlords and tenants are actually urged to operate within the boundaries of 
<br/>the law and the past two years have proved to be the most challenging, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for many 
<br/>Fijians owing to COVID-19, especially those relying on renting as a means of acquiring affordable 
<br/>housing and accessible and secure and adequate housing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  regards  to  the  Landlord  and  Tenancy  Bill  also,  FCCC  will  be 
<br/>collaborating  with  key  stakeholders  namely;  the  Real  Estate  Agents  Licensing  Board  (REALB), 
<br/>Consumer Council of Fiji and the public in drafting of the proposed Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the recommendation for Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) to collaborate with the 
<br/>Department  of  Cooperatives  for  awareness  and  enforcement  strategies,  I  can  assure  this  august 
<br/>Parliament, Sir, that this is actually happening already.  In fact, FCCC works closely with the other 
<br/>Departments  in  the  Ministry,  such  as  the  Transport  Department,  Government  Shipping  Services, 
<br/>Economic Unit and MSME Fiji.  A case in point is the strong collaboration during COVID-19 safe, 
<br/>in terms of ambassador engagements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  external  challenges  which  is  global  pandemic,  supply  chain 
<br/>disruptions in geo-political disruptions, FCCC continues to tirelessly work towards accomplishing 
<br/>its purpose to achieve the best possible outcomes in a competitive and regulative market for the long 
<br/>term benefit for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  quick  point,  if  the  CEO  chooses  to  explain  to  the  whole  of  Fiji 
<br/>regarding the mechanisms of pricings and what happens across the world, that is not political.  That 
<br/>is  just  informing  the  public  that  he  is  not  influenced  in  any  way,  shape,  form  or  whatsoever  by 
<br/>Government.   He is  a CEO for his  part of an independent  organisation  and honourable  Professor 
<br/>Prasad should just refrain from attacking.  If he wants to say something, maybe he should write to 
<br/>them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I believe this report is timely for the country today, 
<br/></span><span>given  the  situation  that  we  face  in  terms  of  petroleum  and  energy  prices.    If  you  look  at  the 
<br/></span><span>recommendation of the Committee, it says, petroleum and LPG price reviews overall, there has been 
<br/>significant movement in the international crude oil prices and refined product prices during the year, 
<br/>fuel prices or petroleum products over the year, are increased slightly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is timely that we debate this, especially this part of the report that 
<br/>touches  on  petroleum  and  energy  prices.  As  we  sit  here  today,  there  is  a  sense  of  misbelief  and 
<br/>helplessness in this country with the way prices have increased in the pumps.  I drive a mid-sized 
<br/>Sedan and I used to fill up my car with $50 but over the weekend, I paid $100 just from half to full 
<br/>tank because the price of unleaded fuel is now $3.01 a litre.  This translates if you use 1 litre gallon 
<br/></span><span>to 3.8 litres, this is almost more than $11 a gallon.  If you go imperial, it is about $13 a gallon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that lately, the Americans have screamed and have protested that 
<br/>they are now paying more than $4 a gallon in the pump in the USA.  This is a huge economy and 
<br/></span><span>people are complaining that they are paying $4 a gallon.  A small economy like Fiji, we are now

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paying $11 a gallon, we should do something about it.  We cannot just sit here and bury our heads in 
<br/>the sand and say, this is the way it is going to be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot rely on FCCC to set the price of fuel.  It must become a matter 
<br/>that commands the attention of the leadership of this country in this House.  We are ready to work 
<br/>with  the  Government  to  set  up  a  bipartisan  Committee  to  look  at  this  thing  and  look  at  ways  of 
<br/>bringing down the cost of petroleum in this country.  We cannot blame the distribution system, we 
<br/>have to do something, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are willing to sit with you to do that.  Otherwise, this 
<br/>country will be crippled, we will be paralysed.  Nothing will happen.  Already the fishermen were 
<br/>saying over the weekend that they are crippled, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the kind of responses I am getting from the other side, is an indication of people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already crippled from their neck up.  They cannot think of anything else, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Talk on the Report! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R.  GAVOKA.-  The Report is  timely, that it brings to  the attention  of Parliament 
<br/>today, Mr. Speaker.  We can increase our storage capacity.   We only carry  about  two months of 
<br/>reserve in this country.  We can increase that, Mr. Speaker… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … and we can set up storages within the Pacific.  We can link up 
<br/>with our neighbours who buy better than us - what are they paying in Australia at the farm?   Do you 
<br/>know?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They do not know, Mr. Speaker.  What they do not even know is what the people are paying 
<br/>in this country already.  So, Mr. Speaker, we are ready to work with the Government as a Parliament 
<br/>to look at ways …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, it is quite sad that when people are paying $3 a litre at 
<br/>the pump today, these people have no idea on how to improve on things better.  They are shooting 
<br/>the messenger.  The messenger is from this side saying, “People want action, things can be done.”  
<br/>Do not just sit there and say, “We are helpless, it is beyond us.”  Do not just sit there and say, “It is 
<br/>beyond us.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Stop!  You just come here and talk.

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- As we all know, change is coming in this country.  It is time for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>change … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- …the people of this country are now tired and sick of a Government 
<br/>that has all the excuses but no solutions to what should be done in this country.  That is what we have 
<br/>been having all these years, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, again, I will say that we cannot allow people in Fiji to be paying this kind of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>petroleum prices.  We cannot, we have to do something about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is the hassle? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  There  are  initiatives.  I  could  give  you  ideas  on  how  to  do  it, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member.  You set up a bipartisan committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, do not carry out a conversation with the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Address the Speaker, and keep addressing the Speaker.  You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    It  is  just  that  it  is  very  hard  having  a 
<br/>dialogue with the deaf.  They are very selective with their hearing.  When the people of this country 
<br/>is suffering, they are satisfied with all these shenanigans that you see in Parliament, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I say here again today, Mr. Speaker, we need to do something about the cost of petroleum.  
<br/>It can be done, and we are ready to work with you and help bring relief to the people of this country 
<br/>and save this country in going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have just been through COVID, it has been difficult, and another challenge is here now, 
<br/>so let us reach out across the aisle.  Government, you cannot do it on your own.  It has been proven 
<br/>many times that you are a disaster, you are in a mess, so reach out across the aisle and we will work 
<br/>with you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I hope that, that message has gone through to them, which the people today are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crying for some solution to the cost of petroleum in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Committee, especially the Chairman 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for producing a very comprehensive report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last five years people of this nation such as the poor, the disadvantage 
<br/>and the pensioners have been asking a question, is the CCF doing their role?  Is this Government 
<br/>doing their job? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is FCCC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- FCCC or ACCF…

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1165 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Are they doing their job? This is because of the continuous increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order.  For the sake of the people 
<br/>watching at home, there is a huge difference between ACCF and FCCC. We are debating FCCC - 
<br/>ACCF is the Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji, this is FCCC.  Thank you, Sir, just in case 
<br/>because again, they are misleading the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Thank  you,  for  the  correction  -  it  is  the  Fijian  Competition  and 
<br/>Consumer Commission.  I repeat, the people of this nation - the Fijians, have been asking for the last 
<br/>five years whether this FCCC has been doing its job.  This is because of the continuous increase in 
<br/>the cost of living.  People have been asking - if you go to the villages or communities - whether this 
<br/>Government is doing their job?  It reflects their poor control, poor monitoring, poor management that 
<br/>has caused the continuous increase in the cost of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to speak on the independence of the Fiji Competition and Consumer 
<br/>Commission but I think the honourable Member has touched that thoroughly.  The question we turn 
<br/>to ask is - are they independent?  Because of the continuous increase in the cost of living.  Are they 
<br/>doing their job?  What is their role?  Honourable Professor Prasad has touched that thoroughly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to advise Parliament of my thoughts for improving this institution 
<br/>in controlling the cost of living.  They have to create a database for all trading products - trading and 
<br/>services - all paying services including food stuff, materials and everything that are being traded in 
<br/>the market.  They need to create a database for that.  Imagine people coming from the rural areas, the 
<br/>highlands and the maritime islands - they have no knowledge whatsoever of the regulated price of 
<br/>food stuff or materials, they have no idea. So this is where, we believe, it is an open door for the 
<br/>business people to make money from the poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  plead  to  this  Parliament  to  make  sure  that  this  institution  provides  a 
<br/>database for all trading services, food stuff and goods to help the people.  If they really care for the 
<br/>people, please advise this institution to do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  Recommendation  5  by  the  Committee,  which  states  that 
<br/>information  packages  be prepared  and disseminated regularly  for all new existing businesses and 
<br/>various requirements under the Act.  But that is not enough - they need to create a database for all 
<br/>trading goods and services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  motion  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chairman of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I convey my appreciation and I commend the work of the Chairman and honourable 
<br/>Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  for  their  deliberations  on  the  Annual 
<br/>Reports.    Also,  my  appreciation  to  the  Management  and  Staff  of  the  Fijian  Competition  and 
<br/>Commerce  Commission  (FCCC)  for  their  efforts  in  ensuring  that  consumers  and  businesses  are 
<br/>protected, despite the challenges they face in their daily operations and administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my Government has been assiduous in developing robust competition laws and 
<br/></span><span>policies, and we actively partner with strong institutions like the FCCC, to ensure that legislations 
<br/>are enforced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Commission  also  safeguards  consumers’  interests  against  unfair  business  practices.  
<br/>Through this collaboration with FCCC, we are improving Fiji’s productivity in promoting innovation 
<br/>and ensuring fair prices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission works with key agencies, such as the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 
<br/>(FRCS), the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), to carry out their 
<br/>duties  in  ensuring  that  every  Fijian  benefits  from  a  healthy  and  well  regulated  market,  and  it  is 
<br/>pleasing to see that they are taking this task to heart. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  FCCC  has  actively  enforced  legislation  and  instituted  fines  for  those 
<br/>businesses that break the rules, and we have witnessed a very positive response with more businesses 
<br/>becoming compliant, resulting in a fair market for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  Government’s  commitment  to  not  only  maintaining  but  to  growing  the  enforcement 
<br/>capabilities of the Commission is clear, Mr. Speaker.  From 2016 to 2018, the resources allocated to 
<br/>FCCC has grown from $1.9 million to $3.3 million, a 73 percent increase on continued commitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, through my Government’s sound economic policy and through the provision of 
<br/>various Government incentives to the private sector, Fiji has witnessed increased competition across 
<br/>different industries, including our retail food stores and supermarkets.  I am pleased to see positive 
<br/>response from supermarkets and they are now working with the Commission to rework their business 
<br/>models to focus on maintaining lower and affordable food prices for ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite this progress, you will hear the Opposition try to score points by attaching themselves 
<br/>to issues, like the price of oil, gas and food prices, especially wheat.  Global prices have been going 
<br/>up  since  the  second  half  of  2021  because  of  higher  port  prices  and  freight  costs.    Everyone 
<br/>understands that, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The entire world is facing supply chain disruptions, as the supply of goods are unable to keep 
<br/>up with higher consumer demand, and this problem is made worse by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  
<br/>The price of crude oil is currently sitting above US$100 per barrel, when a couple of years ago it was 
<br/>sitting at US$46 per barrel.  Wheat and other commodity prices have also been increasing, but the 
<br/>Opposition does not account for any of these global factors that affect prices and its impacts on fuel-
<br/>reliant  sectors.    They  do  not  understand  how  an  economy  works  or  worse,  they  are  intentionally 
<br/>misleading the Fijian public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, those factors are beyond our national control and (but the Opposition chose to 
<br/>woefully ignore), underscore the importance of organisations, like FCCC.  We need to ensure that 
<br/>Fiji is protected as possible from fluctuations and global prices.  Unfortunately, we also have some 
<br/>unethical businesses who, if left unchecked, would take advantage of these fluctuations and make 
<br/>their impact even more dramatic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For that reason, FCCC actively prevents additional price gouging by enforcing price caps, 
<br/>resulting in fair prices for ordinary Fijians.  The FCCC continuously monitors compliance to rent 
<br/>freeze orders pertinent to Fiji’s residential rental market and has resolved a number of complaints 
<br/></span><span>received from tenants and landlords.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government is committed to growing our economy, support Fijian 
<br/>businesses and improve Fijian livelihoods.  Since day one, we have listened, we noted concerns, but 
<br/></span><span>we did not stop there.  We do more than just listen.  We implement change through the review of

<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1167 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policies that will deliver development that changes lives for the better, in this case, foster competitive, 
<br/>efficient, fair and informed market place to enhance the welfare of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  at  hand,  in  particular,  I 
<br/>commend the work of the Committee.  Just to share some of the issues which were raised in addition 
<br/>to  the findings  and recommendations before us,  there were also  issues raised on competition  and 
<br/>compliance highlights, and price control and monitoring highlights.  One of the issues raised there, 
<br/>let me read that out:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “… monitoring activities were carried out in urban areas including cities, towns, et cetera 
<br/>and rural areas.  A total of 395 traders were issued with infringement notices and warned 
<br/>during the year, 91 were issued with spot-on fines.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  related  to  recommendation  five,  if  you  look  at  that,  the  Committee  is  recommending  the 
<br/>formulation of more effective awareness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues raised is that a lot of rural business operators are not aware of some of the 
<br/>regulations, particularly those in the villages the small business operations.  I think in the last year or 
<br/>so, some of them had been warned by the organisation regarding their prices and they were not aware 
<br/>of that, plus the cost of running businesses in rural areas is quite high, given the freight cost et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other important issue raised in this report is on recommendation four.  If you look at that 
<br/>recommendation, that is related to the draft Landlord and Tenants Bill, again this is work in progress 
<br/>which  we  hope  to  see  progress  further  until  the  Bill  comes  before  us.    Just  reading  from  the 
<br/>presentation, the rent section manager legal were tasked in early 2017 to undertake the preparation 
<br/>of the proposed Landlord and Tenant Bill, the process had an action plan from January 2017 and a 
<br/>technical working group, so again, this has been ongoing and we are urging that this be progressed 
<br/>further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  draft  Bill  was  formulated  following  extensive  consultations  and  there  have  been  issues 
<br/>regarding this, where a handful of traders were taken to court for failing to pay spot fines and some 
<br/>were found to have illegally increased rent on residential property despite the residential rent freeze, 
<br/>and there are also the abilities to settle proceedings in relation to the tenant and landlord relationships.  
<br/>So, we are hoping that this proposed Bill will alleviate some of those issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issues  I  thought  would  be  good  to  raise  in  Parliament  are  the  concerns  of  the 
<br/></span><span>automotive industry.  The FCCC does not regulate the automotive industry, there is a self-regulating 
<br/>guideline that guides the industry to ensure it is compliant.  The complaints received include traders 
<br/>not  willing  honour  warranty,  non-disclosure  of  information  relating  to  warranty  and  accepting 
<br/>payments and failing to supply. These are some of the ongoing issues with the automotive industry 
<br/>which we look forward to the FCCC to take a more, I suppose, proactive stance in resolving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In building and construction, the industry recorded the second highest number of complaints 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as per the complaints record.  Those are some of the thoughts that I have highlighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also an issue regarding Home Care Initiative.  Let me read it out:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Home Care Initiative was provided by Ministry of Economy while the Farms 
<br/>Care Scheme was provided by the Ministry of Agriculture.  Issues raised by members of 
<br/></span><span>the public whereby traders had taken money from the recipients of the Initiative but had 
<br/></span><span>not  supplied  the  items.  Apart  from  these  complaints  that  also  surface  the  traders  had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>1168 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased the prices in terms of which could be purchased under the Initiative.  A total of 
<br/>19 traders were investigated and 14 were charged.  So those are some of the issues I thought 
<br/>are  important  to  raise  and  also  for  the  members  of  the  public  to  understand  the  role  of 
<br/>FCCC.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  what  Honourable  Gavoka  has  mentioned,  Sir,  we  have  to  accept  that  Fiji  is 
<br/>undergoing a cost of living crisis in terms of the rising prices as mentioned by the Honourable Gavoka 
<br/>and the Honourable Prime Minister and the reasons behind it.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Cost  of  Living  crisis  refers  to  the  fall  in  real  disposable  incomes  that  is  adjusted  for 
<br/>inflation  and  after  taxes  and  benefits  that  have  been  experienced  by  the  country.  It  is  being  cost 
<br/>predominantly  by  high  inflation,  outstripping  wage  and  benefit  increases  and  has  been  further 
<br/>worsened by various other issues beyond our control.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is an issue which we in the Opposition had raised that we have a commission of our 
<br/>Committee of Inquiry into the cost of living crisis.  I had raised this but this did not come through as 
<br/>a motion and it would be important for Government to undertake this cost of living analysis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following are some of the analyses and questions which need to be asked: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How high is inflation and how is that expected to change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>What exactly is contributing to cost of living? 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Which prices are rising faster or rapidly? 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are incomes matching the rise in prices (I understand that the minimum income has been 
<br/>adjusted but how does this measure in terms of the people adjusting to the rapid rising cost 
<br/>of living)?  
<br/>Has tax changes contributed to the cost of living crisis?  
<br/>Are  poor  households  worse  affected  by  the  Cost  of  Living  crisis  than  richer  ones?  (Of 
<br/>course that is a ‘yes’ and that needs to be clearly analysed and examined). 
<br/>Cost of Living affects poor households more.   
<br/>Inflation rates are more likely to be on  average more on poor households when energy 
<br/>prices also rise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So there is  an urgent  need for  an assessment to  be done and Government  has made some 
<br/>initiatives, for example, zero rated on 21 basic consumer items.  How effective has this been? There 
<br/></span><span>needs to be a clear study on this because, of course, this has been nullified by inflation and there 
<br/></span><span>needs to be a reassessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Not nullified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Well, nullified or the impact has not been as expected.  That is 
<br/>something which we or Government needs to undertake.  There is an issue regarding the fuel as raised 
<br/>by Leader of SODELPA, Honourable Gavoka, in the Opposition Party.  Of course the other side of 
<br/>the House has been joking about it but they have not done anything about the fuel surcharge or tax. 
<br/></span><span>There needs to be action on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tax threshold, again, that needs to be re-examined, that has been actioned on but, of course, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that needs to be relooked at.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation again to the Cost of Living crisis, what are the measures, as I mentioned, need to 
<br/>be done to target the poorer sections of the household of our communities given the rise in poverty 
<br/>level to alleviate the crisis which we are going through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, to conclude Government needs to control its expenditure.  At the moment it has 
<br/>does nothing to control its expenditure.  One of the main areas which they could control expenditure 
<br/>is their salaries and that is a major cause.  I am sure that they are earning more than enough right now 
<br/>(that needs to be cut by 30 percent and even their allowances).  Other areas are on leasing of vehicles, 
<br/>grants to organisations such as FBC (which is currently being used by government for propaganda 
<br/>purposes, for campaigning in the Elections), you need to cut down on those costs in order to balance 
<br/>them out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hope that these suggestions are taken on board by Government as we move forward even 
<br/>though they have a very limited time (they will be going out soon but if they can action that before 
<br/>they go out, we will be very grateful about that). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I give the floor to the last speaker before the Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of issues that I would 
<br/>like to raise in response to what the Opposition said.  Sir, the FCCC obviously plays a very pivotal 
<br/>role in the economy because it does provide that independent assessment in respect of not just only 
<br/>consumer protection but ensuring that there is competition continues within the economy and as we 
<br/>know that any economy must have robust competition to be able to deliver not only for businesses 
<br/>but more so for the consumers so that they get better pricing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget that has been allocated to FCCC Sir, if you see in 2016-2017 
<br/>the  annual  budget  allocated  was  $2.4  million,  today  it  gets  $4.5  million.    One  of  the  reasons,  of 
<br/>course, Sir, is that, for example the 2021 financial year we granted a specific sum of $300,000 to 
<br/>conduct investigations and monitor the tax and duty reductions for 1,942 items.  So whenever, for 
<br/>example, we reduce a duty on a particular item, it has to be ensured that those reductions and duties 
<br/>are actually passed on to members of the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Sir, the initial funding was to create awareness, inspections and tours to monitor 
<br/>business traders and rural and maritime regions (honourable Kuridrani should now this) and in fact 
<br/>they have an MOU with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs in particular for areas in the maritime and 
<br/></span><span>the deep rural areas where there are remote villages.  There may be a village co-operative store where 
<br/></span><span>they have actually a regulated item and they may not actually be charging the regulated price, so they 
<br/>have to be monitored and actually create this awareness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, just in  respect,  the honourable Prime Minister has mentioned overall the Government 
<br/>objective but in respect of what honourable Professor Prasad and the others have said, they seem to 
<br/>misunderstand FCCC’s role is not to control the cost of things in Fiji in the way that they are meaning.  
<br/>Honourable Kuridrani said, “Oh FCCC is not doing its job because the price of things have been 
<br/>going up.”  Well, it has been going up and FCCC’s job is to make sure that it does not get price out 
<br/>of hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He should know that there are certain items in Fiji, Sir, that are price controlled and there are 
<br/>certain items in Fiji that are not price controlled.  If you want to go and buy a plastic toy, it is not 
<br/>price controlled but if you want to buy rice, it is price controlled.  If you want to buy cooking oil, it 
<br/></span><span>is price controlled, if you want to buy fuel it is price controlled.  If you want to buy cigarettes it has 
<br/></span><span>a different pricing mechanism altogether, it is not price controlled. So, he needs to understand that. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FCCC’s job is not to reduce the price of things.  So I shudder when I listen to those kinds 
<br/>of comments from the Opposition, Sir, because God forbid if they ever come into Government, they 
<br/>think they will but they would not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>God forbid that, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, because they will go off to FCCC and say, “Do not 
<br/>increase the price of flour”, businesses actually will collapse.  If today Punja and Sons and FMF are 
<br/>bringing wheat at $300 a ton, grounding it in Fiji making flour it is price controlled at the wholesale 
<br/>level.  In other words before they sell it to the supermarket, it has to be price controlled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So they will go and say, “Look I paid $300 a ton from Australia, this is my freight cost, this 
<br/>is my labour cost, my electricity cost, et cetera, and then they say, ‘You can only make this much 
<br/>margin” then they will sell it to the supermarket and then Shop and Save Supermarket, for example, 
<br/>will come or whoever their retail supermarkets are, they will go to FCCC and say, “Look I bought it 
<br/>for this much from Punja and Sons and this is my labour cost, my rent cost, electricity cost, et cetera, 
<br/>they will say ‘You can make only this much’.  That is how price control works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If tomorrow, as he is suggesting, Australia puts up the price of wheat from $300 to $400 a 
<br/>tonne, obviously the price of flour will go up but if they were to be in Government, they will tell 
<br/>Punja and Sons ‘You sell it at $300 a tonne price’.  The entire business will shut down, they would 
<br/>not be able to run a business because you do not know how to run a business, he does not know how 
<br/>to run a business.  None of them know how to run a business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad does not even know how to run a business.  He stands up here 
<br/>and talks about FCCC saying, ‘Oh, it’s affecting the economy’.  This is the man who has continuously 
<br/>undermined the Fijian economy.  He says, ‘Oh the banking sector is not doing well, FSC is bankrupt, 
<br/>Fiji Airways is bankrupt.  This organisation is not independent ….

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order.  You have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  think,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Attorney-General  borders  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>irrelevance and making wild allegations.  When we come into this Parliament … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- What is your Point of Order?

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and raise the issue of independence …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When we raise the issue of independence of an organisation, 
<br/></span><span>it is not undermining the economy.  In fact the whole report (the private sector diagnostic report) 
<br/>actually talks about how inefficient …

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … how the lack  of independence in  organisations actually 
<br/>affect the overall economy, so that is not undermining the economy, Mr. Speaker.  He should stick 
<br/>to his ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.    Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  has 
<br/>continuously on the floor of this Parliament undermined the Fijian economy - every single chance 
<br/>they get.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a big lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- When the World Bank puts out a report, he does not like it, 
<br/>‘Oh World Bank is not independent’.  When the RBF puts out a report, ‘Oh RBF is not independent’.  
<br/>This is the kind of shenanigans that people actually look at and that is what undermines the economy, 
<br/>not FCCC because it is trying to do its job.  The fact of the matter is, honourable Professor Prasad to 
<br/>stand up in Parliament, he was actually investigated by FCCC for rental purposes in 2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- No wonder you are attacking FCCC, my boy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we come to Parliament, we need to 
<br/>come to Parliament with clean hands.  He was investigated by FCCC.  I just had a text message from 
<br/>Joel Abraham, the CEO of FCCC.  He said about a year or so ago, he met me in a supermarket, put 
<br/>his hand on my shoulder and said ‘You’re doing a good job’ and today according to him, he is not 
<br/>doing a good job.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point of the matter is this … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  a  Point  of  Order  again.    The  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy is actually lying.  I have never said that Joel Abraham has not done good in fact I said that 
<br/>I  do  not  envy  his  job.    I  said  that  this  man  (the Minister  for  Economy)  sitting  there  makes  them 
<br/>political.  He gets his permanent secretary to respond to politicians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I actually said that he is doing a good job but that he is under 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the influence of politicians in the FijiFirst Party.  I have said that, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I think honourable Professor Prasad misheard me.  I said 
<br/>that Joel Abraham sent me a text to say that you patted him on the shoulder saying ‘You’re doing a 
<br/>good job’.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I did, I did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes.  That is what I said.  What is your problem?  I said the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>same thing.  Mr. Speaker, Sir … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because you are implying that you know …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You see this is the kind of contradiction and hypocrisy of 
<br/></span><span>the Members from the other side.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not implying anything, stop reading into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - FCC 2016-2017 and 
<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things.  I wish honourable Professor Prasad was as vociferous as he is today, if he was vociferous 
<br/>like that in New Zealand.  Do not do runaway, you know.  Do not run away.  I wish he was vociferous 
<br/>in New Zealand, Mr. Speaker, Sir.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is the other point that I wanted to make: the independence of FCCC 
<br/>is actually seen in the fact that despite it being an Election year, FCCC has actually gone ahead with 
<br/>price  increases.    It  goes  to  show  the  independence  of  the  organisation.    They  do  not  seem  to 
<br/>understand that.  In fact they do not even make submissions as highlighted by somebody earlier on.  
<br/>Honourable Koya had said that they do not go and make submissions.  The Fiji Labour Party did it.  
<br/>Why  did  you  not  join  them  and  make  submissions?    Various  other  parties  have  appeared  before 
<br/>FCCC and made submissions.  Why do they not do that?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government in fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, objected to the sugar price increase.  Yet they went 
<br/>ahead and gave the sugar price increase, yes, admittedly not as high as what FSC wanted but they 
<br/>actually  still  gave  them  a  price  rise.    We  could  have  done  a  political  shoddy  job  here,  if  we  had 
<br/>political influence over FCCC and said ‘Do not increase the price, it is Elections year.  Elections may 
<br/>be on 13</span><span>th</span><span> July, the first day we can have elections, do not increase the price, so public will feel good 
<br/>about it, but we did not do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is this, we have foreign investors in Fiji, the Japanese 
<br/>have invested 44 percent in EFL, they would never come and invest in Fiji, if they did not feel the 
<br/>independent institutions that look at price regulation over price controlled item like electricity if it 
<br/>were and they would never invest.  In fact, if they were honest with themselves, they would look at 
<br/>the Act itself and find out what are the mechanisms that gives it independence from every single 
<br/>institution  including  Government,  Ministers  and  Permanent  Secretaries.    They  do  not  come  to 
<br/>Parliament with clean hands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I also wanted to make was honourable Gavoka, he just goes 
<br/>on and on, we must do something, we must do something.  He has not being able to produce a single 
<br/>alternative budget since 2014, nor has NFP, no one has been able to produce single alternative budget.  
<br/>They think that the solution is in just having a Committee, sitting allowance, go off, talk to people 
<br/>and we will find a solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he says we do not know the price of fuel, let me read out the price of fuel 
<br/>according to the GlobalPetrolPrices.com which does it on a weekly basis.  The last posting they did 
<br/></span><span>which is a credible source; the only source you should go to; on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> May in Fiji, the price of unleaded 
<br/></span><span>fuel at Fijian dollars, they come and say oh in US it is $4, but they do not do the conversion; US$4 
<br/>obviously is FJ$8, they do not need to do the conversion, compare apples with apples. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unleaded fuel, Australia was $2.73 a litre on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> May, Fiji was $3.02 a litre, 
<br/>New Zealand was $3.45 a litre. We were a lot cheaper than New Zealand, we were slightly expensive 
<br/>than Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, diesel on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> May, Fiji was $2.85 a litre, Australia was $3.01 a litre, New 
<br/>Zealand was $3.41 a litre.  His logic fails because he says they have bigger economy, they have the 
<br/></span><span>purchasing power, so despite being a country that has 4.5 million people in New Zealand, their petrol 
<br/></span><span>prices and diesel prices were still more than ours.  He says we should build more storage capacity, 
<br/>you will never be able to match the amount in volume of fuel that New Zealand and Australia buys 
<br/>and  no  one  will  be  willing  to  put  up  that  kind  of  money  up  front.  They  do  not  even  understand 
<br/></span><span>hedging, hedging in the price of fuel is being done, they do not understand about hedging at all.  You 
<br/></span><span>only know the word, you do not know how it works.

<br/>FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1173 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point they made, you know honourable Tuisawau.  He went 
<br/>around about the cost of living, wages, et cetera and the independent assessment.  Dr. Partha who has 
<br/>done three ways independent reviews of the minimum wage in Fiji.  He is an independent professor 
<br/>from Australia.  When they looked at minimum wage increase, they go around the countryside, they 
<br/>talked  to  trade  unions  probably  like  NFP  if  they  want  to  turn  up,  meet  employers,  employees, 
<br/>individuals can go and make submissions and based on that, then he recommended a minimum wage 
<br/>increase.    None  of  them  have  mentioned  that,  none  of  them  mentioned  that  in  Fiji,  there  is  no 
<br/>minimum wage until the Bainimarama-led Government introduced the minimum wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>None  of  them  mentioned,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  since  then,  there  has  been  three  reviews.  
<br/>None of them mentioned the fact that now we have a minimum wage of $4 to be incrementally given 
<br/>and reach $4 by January of next year.  None of them mentioned that, Sir.  None of them mentioned 
<br/>the fact that the interim minimum wage increment of $4 means the wages in the other wage sectors 
<br/>will also increase by the same percentage, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fuel of 20 percent has been removed.  He says there is no assessment 
<br/>being done of the 21 VAT items.  Never in the history of Fiji have we had 21 items zero rated at 
<br/>VAT and not only those six items, things like sanitary pads for women, toothpaste, soap, washing 
<br/>detergent - these are everyday household items that people buy.  Before, there was only six items, 
<br/>rice, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the problem. There is no independent analysis being done and this is 
<br/>where I continuously say in this House that there is a lot of misinformation. These young students 
<br/>are here, political science students, imagine the nonsense they are listening to from the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have urged people to be critically assessing information. A lot of these information are 
<br/>available independently on various credible pages and on credible sites. There is a rationale that has 
<br/>been given and so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge all honourable Members to, please, understand the 
<br/>Report you are debating on.  The CCC is not ACCF and FCCC does not reduce the prices of things 
<br/>- it is independent. We need to be able to ensure that this independence continues because it would 
<br/>not  only  provide  consumer  protection  but  what  is  critically  important  is  to  be  able  to  provide 
<br/>competition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you have competition in the market, we increase consumption, we create jobs where people 
<br/>like them who would go on the workforce soon and we would all be able to have a stable economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the Chairperson for his right of reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- For the information of this House, honourable Kuridrani and honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau are  members of this Committee and we often do not comment on our own work.  It does 
<br/>not work that way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, it is unusual to have a Point of Order on the right of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply. You know the procedure, so do not bug the system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Sir,  what I want to say is that, these two honourable Members are members 
<br/>of the Committee and often, we do not comment on our own work. They commented the work of the 
<br/></span><span>Committee and I say that we do not comment on our work.  Let the others comment and you do not 
<br/></span><span>comment your own work.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad mentioned that he expected the Committee to

<div><span>May I suggest to him to read the Standing Orders of Parliament of the Republic of Fiji and
