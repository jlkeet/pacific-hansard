<div><span>Status of the Curriculum Advisory Services 
<br/> (Question No. 99/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government  inform  Parliament  on  the  current  status  of  the  Curriculum  Advisory 
<br/>Services with respect to the development of curricula to meet the needs of our children? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Kepa  for  her  question.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the education sector requires continuous improvements in policies and curriculum to 
<br/>meet the needs of the learners and the workforce.  A responsive curriculum that meets the economic 
<br/>and development needs of the nation including cultural and moral expectations are essential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Curriculum Advisory Services was restructured in 2020.  It is now called Curriculum 
<br/></span><span>Development and Advisory Unit.  The Senior Education Officer positions were all renamed to Senior 
<br/>Curriculum Specialists.  The function of the unit as honourable Kepa knows is to develop, implement 
<br/>and review relevant curriculum with appropriate learning and teaching resources.  Also to provide 
<br/>professional guidance to the teachers in the implementation of the curriculum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, curriculum review and development process is guided by the Fiji National 
<br/>Curriculum Framework which uses an outcome based approach to  curriculum.  The Fiji National 
<br/>Curriculum Framework sets the education philosophy, structure, content and guiding principle for 
<br/>the Curriculum Development Advisory Unit and again, for any curriculum to be developed, scoping 
<br/>and  sequencing  is  very  important,  consultation  is  very  important  and  then  the  whole  process  of 
<br/>curriculum writing starts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  curriculum  development  is  a  specialised  assignment  which  requires  analysis,  design, 
<br/>development and implementation of the curriculum including training of teachers and working out 
<br/>the assessment strategies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past several months, the Curriculum Development Advisory Unit 
<br/></span><span>has  been  working  on  a  number  of  curriculum  revisions.    In  2021,  the  new  Year  11  Life  Maths 
<br/></span><span>curriculum  was  trialled  in  the  4  divisions.    This  year,  the  curriculum  has  been  rolled  out  in  all 
<br/>secondary schools while Year 12 Life Maths curriculum is being trialled in the schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also in the process of revising social science and history curriculum.  
<br/>This  is  to  ensure  that  our  history  curriculum  is  relevant  with  more  emphasis  on  Fiji’s  history.  
<br/>Unfortunately Mr. Speaker, Sir, our children tend to learn more about other country’s history than 
<br/>Fiji’s history and we want to change that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has now embarked on the revision of special and inclusive 
<br/>education policy.  The Senior Curriculum Specialists in SIE is working closely with DFAT through 
<br/>the Fiji Education programme facility.  Just last week, the first major stakeholder consultation was 
<br/>held in Suva and the next consultation is planned for the West and then one planned for the North.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to appreciate the fact that the curriculum review goes to a process 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that involves consultations, comparisons and benchmarking with international curriculum and
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>developing appropriate pedagogies. With the Ministry’s emphasis on including ICT enabled learning, 
<br/>the curriculum development needs to take into account the provision of converting components to e-
<br/>learning as required.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This means the inclusion of relevant pedagogies for ICT enabled learning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the  Curriculum  Development  Advisory  Unit  is  working  in  collaboration  with  UNICEF  and  the 
<br/>international experts in ECE in revising the ECE subsector. The initial consultation began with the 
<br/>setting up of the National ECE technical working group comprising a number of stakeholders from 
<br/>across the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Curriculum Development Advisory Unit has been working on Primary 
<br/>School Literacy and Numeracy curriculum over the past couple of years. Currently the  Years 1-4 
<br/>curriculum  is  being  trialled  in  90  schools  across  the  country.  This  also  involves  the  training  of 
<br/>champions in these schools who would lead the implementation using new pedagogies in teaching 
<br/>these subjects and this is for the first time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that special information is prepared for 
<br/>parents who would like to guide their children at home in the area of numeracy and literacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next year, while Years 1 to 4 curriculum is rolled out in all schools, Years 5 to 8 curriculum 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would be trialled in these 90 schools. This work is being carried out in partnership with TVET.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the importance of citizenship education is also critical to ensure that the 
<br/>students  understand  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  citizen  in  a  democracy.  Moral  and  civic 
<br/>education  focuses  on  developing  the  moral  well-being  of  our  students.  The  Moral  and  Civic 
<br/>Education curriculum would be taught from ECE to Year 11.  In years 12 and 13 life skills will be 
<br/>taught.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Curriculum  Development  Advisory  Unit  developed  Moral  and  Civic  education 
<br/>curriculum  for  Years  1-3.  The  curriculum  is  being  trialled  in  Years  1-3  this  year  while  they  are 
<br/>working on the development of the curriculum for Years 4-6 and this would be trialled in 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we started consultation on this curriculum, we were overwhelmed by 
<br/>the  support  we  received  from  the  stakeholders.  We  held  a  number  of  meetings  with  stakeholders 
<br/>including NGOs, development partners and trade-based organisation, Head Teachers Association, 
<br/>School Heads, Special Education stakeholders, Teacher training institution and many more groups.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pedagogies used to teach these curriculum are based on learning by doing an inquiry-
<br/></span><span>based learning. These include story-telling, short projects and investigative approach. The curriculum 
<br/></span><span>does not have exams because the philosophy behind this teaching is to actually see a change in the 
<br/>behaviour  of  the  child.    As  students  progressed  to  higher  levels,  activities  would  include  more 
<br/>discussions,  role-plays  and  research.  In  secondary  schools,  this  would  also  develop  into  debates, 
<br/>research, dialogue and real-life projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the curriculum review is an important part of the dynamic education system. 
<br/>We are very mindful that the curriculum needs to be flexible, up-to-date and relevant through the 
<br/>changes that will prepare the students not only today but for the future as well. Our Senior Curriculum 
<br/>Specialists  seek  assistance  from  an  expertise  of  specialised  personnel  sometimes  available  and 
<br/>provided by donor partners. In this way, while they revised the curriculum, they also  get to learn 
<br/>from these experts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  there  is  criticism  especially  from  some  politically-motivated 
<br/>individuals and parties, the Ministry is bringing about change unilaterally, this is not true at all. We 
<br/>are mindful that consultations are an integral part of any work that we do on curriculum revision and

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>currently,  we  are  just  doing  that.  As  we  go  forward,  we  want  to  ensure  that  we  revise  all  our 
<br/>curriculum,  modernise  the  pedagogies  and  create  curriculum  that  could  be  used  to  create  online 
<br/>learning resources and allow students to take charge of the learning hence, meeting the needs of our 
<br/>children. Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir.

<div><span>Vuvale Partnership –RFMF and Australian Defence Force  
<br/> (Question No. 100/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update  Parliament  on  how  the  Vuvale 
<br/>partnership has benefitted the relationship between the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and 
<br/>the Australian Defence Forces? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>this question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know and of course value the strong bilateral relations that 
<br/>we share with Australia.  However, Sir, the Vuvale Partnership is more than what I can say, what we 
<br/></span><span>used to enjoy under that bilateral relationship.  We are thankful to the honourable Prime Minister and 
<br/></span><span>the Honourable Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison because of the Vuvale Partnership that was 
<br/>forged in 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  partnership  not  only  shows  the  level  of  cooperation  that  has  been 
<br/>elevated but demonstrate the deep-rooted relationship that we share, not only as friends but as I have 
<br/>stated that Vuvale Partnership is more than this, we have become family that shared common history 
<br/>and we have greatly benefitted from this partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  briefly  the  Vuvale</span><span> </span><span>Partnership  provided  five  pillars  that  laid  the 
<br/>foundation for the partnership to work, it is broad-ranging and comprehensive.  If I may just state the 
<br/>five pillars before going on to the benefits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the five pillars are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthening our people-to-people links; 
<br/>enhancing our security cooperation; 
<br/>deepening our economic relationship; 
<br/>building our cooperation  on international and regional issues; and 
<br/>fostering closer institutional linkages in support of strong and inclusive societies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the partnership have opened up many opportunities especially through the 
<br/>enhancing of our security cooperation where our Defence Forces have benefitted greatly not only in 
<br/>terms of capacity and capability development but also in the area of infrastructure development as 
<br/>well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me inform this august House that the Vuvale Partnership has contributed 
<br/>the following to the RFMF and the benefits that come with it as well.  I have talked about capacity-
<br/>building between the Australian Defence Force and our RFMF personnel and also includes exercises 
<br/>between  the  two  Defence  Forces.    We  have  seen  an  increased  number  of  Fijians  participating  in 
<br/>Australia  on  training  and  also  at  the  highest  level,  particularly  at  the  Staff  College  and  Defence 
<br/>College as well.  With that increased allocation, particularly for Defence College and Staff College, 
<br/>is something that we are grateful for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  not  only  that,  we  have  troops  engaged  in  various  training  exercises  and 
<br/>exchanges which are good for us in terms of the interoperability and familiarising the Forces with 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the doctrines that we also share.  One of the prominent exercises is exercise coral warrior which I 
<br/>believe you are well familiar with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure Development: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen the opening of Blackrock at the 
<br/>cost of around FJ$100 million and it is up and running.  Last week, I had the privilege to go and do 
<br/>the  official  closing  of  the  first  course  that  was  run  at  Blackrock  where  again,  our  friends  from 
<br/>Australia  also  participated  as  part  of  the  directing  staff  for  the  course  on  Child  Protection  and 
<br/>Civilians Protection as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Maritime Essential Services Centre that will be constructed at Lami, the budget is 
<br/>around $50 million and we are hopeful that this work will progress once all the requirements are met 
<br/>with the relevant authorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Stanley Brown Naval Wharf, we have commissioned the extension that will cater for the 
<br/>two guardian class patrol boats, the </span><span>RFNS Savenaca</span><span> and </span><span>RFNS Puamau</span><span> which will come into line 
<br/>next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the support for our peacekeeping missions by providing strategic airlifts for our 
<br/></span><span>contingents, we are thankful for that.  I have talked about the patrol boat programme and under this 
<br/></span><span>programme as I have stated, we have the guardian class patrol boats, we have already had  </span><span>RFNS 
<br/>Savenaca</span><span> in 2020 and </span><span>RFNS Puamau</span><span> will be delivered in 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Operation Assist as per the Australian Defence Force’s 
<br/>(ADF’s) ongoing</span><span> </span><span>support for recovery efforts after the destruction of </span><span>Cyclone Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>Cyclone Ana</span><span>, 
<br/>they were involved initially in the reconstruction of Galoa Primary School and of course, Galoa is 
<br/>the feeder school  into Lekutu  Secondary School.    They have also  taken up the task of rebuilding 
<br/>Lekutu  Secondary  School  and  as  we  speak,  Sir,  we  have  the  ADF  Engineers  back  at  Lekutu 
<br/>Secondary School for the completion of the project which they have started last year and the timeline 
<br/>as per the OC’s briefing to me last Wednesday is they hope to complete this by end of July.  We have 
<br/>that 33-member reconstruction team currently working with the RFMF engineers as we speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, very briefly, are some of the benefits under the Vuvale Partnership and as I have stated, 
<br/>Sir, it is not only the normal friendship but it is beyond that and of course, we wish to reiterate that 
<br/>the Australia/Fiji Partnership have contributed greatly to our Defence Force and this is a testament 
<br/>of our close-knit Defence family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker.    I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for his reply and we are grateful to the Australian people for the Vuvale relationship. Can 
<br/>we be assured, Sir, that we will not go out and do something stupid, like allowing China to build their 
<br/>base here as we have in the Solomon Islands?  Solomon Islands right now, Mr. Speaker, is a topic of 
<br/>contention.  Can they assure the people of Fiji that they will not go and do something stupid like that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is about Australia and Fiji, so the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vuvale Partnership has nothing to do with China.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Removal and Disposal of Derelict Ships - Suva Harbour 
<br/>(Question No. 101/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry’s plan for the removal and disposal of derelict ships at the Suva Harbour? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for the question.  Essentially, in a nutshell, the law requires the vessel owners to remove the derelict 
<br/>ships, essentially, to carry wreck removal insurance as we have seen some of the companies do that 
<br/>in recent time.  Essentially, a lot of local shipping companies do not seem to carry this shipwreck 
<br/>removal insurance and, in fact, they are the ones who sort of littered the harbours in lots of places 
<br/>where these derelict ships have not been removed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, in order to remove them, we have to have multiagency partnership to be able to 
<br/>ensure that when we do remove derelict ships, there is no damage to the environment, we have MSAF 
<br/>involved and of course Fiji Ports Corporation Limited (FPCL).  This question has been answered 
<br/>previously too.  The fact is that, these ship owners actually have a responsibility, they are the ones 
<br/>who are supposed to remove it, and now the burden seems to be falling on FPCL.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> A number of shipping companies actually have been given notices to remove derelict ships.  
<br/>I have got a whole list of them as to which ones need to be removed.  The one, of course, that was 
<br/>quite well known was the ship that was here with the containers floating, and the insurance company 
<br/></span><span>moved in and removed it.  It is obviously not an easy task to do so, it does require lots of logistics 
<br/></span><span>and planning and the Department of Environment also needs to be involved in it.  Essentially, in a 
<br/>nutshell,  that  is  the  game  plan  in  respect  of  removing  it.    Sometimes  it  can  cost  anywhere  from 
<br/>$50,000 to millions of dollars just to remove one particular derelict ship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cost is quite enormous.  There was an estimate done, that to remove all the derelict ships 
<br/>in Suva Harbour, Lautoka Harbour and Levuka, they will cost about FJ$59 million.  A lot of these 
<br/>ships have actually local owners and they, sort of, sunk it and disappeared, so these companies do 
<br/>not even exist.   That is the state of affairs.  We are happy to report that none of the derelict ships at 
<br/>the moment caused any damage visibly, the Department of Environment has not alerted us to any 
<br/>environmental degradation from these derelict ships.  They are, of course, a nuisance in the sense 
<br/>that it can get in the way in terms of the various movement of vessels in the Harbour.  There are 
<br/>currently 17 derelict vessels and 32 wrecks in Suva Harbour, Lautoka Port area and Levuka Port area 
<br/>altogether.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/>response that has been given.  In 2018, there were nine ships listed as derelict vessels in the Suva 
<br/>Harbour.  Currently, there are now 16 as alluded to  by the Honourable  Minister.  The traditional 
<br/></span><span>owners of the Suva fishing ground, which is the Navakavu fishing traditional owners undertaking the 
<br/></span><span>Navakavu  Blue  Economic  Zone  project  and  they  have  requested  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited 
<br/>(FPCL) for details of those vessel owners so that they could assist in terms of clearing those derelict 
<br/>vessels from the Suva Harbour.  So, they are requesting if FPCL, through a correspondence dated 4</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>January,  2022,  could  provide  the  details  of  the  vessel  owners  to  them  so  they  could  assist  in  the 
<br/>removal of those derelict vessels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  there  is  no  question  in  that  but  obviously,  if  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member wants that type of information, we are quite happy to correspond with people 
<br/>who have written the letter to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Skilled Professionals Evaluation Committee 
<br/>(Question No. 102/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1213 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  inform 
<br/>Parliament on how the Skilled Professionals Evaluation Committee can assist in addressing 
<br/>skills shortage as we move towards new and emerging industries? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for the question and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the opportunity to respond. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  lot  of  misconception  about  the  purpose  of  Skilled  Professionals 
<br/>Evaluation Committee (SPEC).  It was actually formed by the Registration of Skilled Professionals 
<br/>Act  2016.  The SPEC  was formed really to  support Fiji’s economic  growth  and it is  not  there to 
<br/>displace employment for locals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Registration of Skilled Professionals Act was enacted as I said to allow for fast tracking 
<br/>of the process of immigration approvals and registrations were required.  SPEC actually responsible 
<br/>for  processing  applications  expeditiously,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  sectors  where  Fiji  needs  skilled 
<br/>professionals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SPEC’s  role  has  been  acknowledged  just  as  promoting  competitive 
<br/></span><span>behaviour in certain professional fields for instance the medical profession which previously dictated 
<br/></span><span>the labour market.  So, through the Act, we have actually created the mechanism, Mr. Speaker, to 
<br/>first identify the skills shortages within the rapidly developing Fijian economy and next to expediting 
<br/>the process of recruiting the skills to actually bridge the gap.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  context  of  economic  evolutions,  such  as  the  transition  towards  green  economy, 
<br/>digitalisation and diversifying industries, the likes of the oil sector in modernising the agriculture and 
<br/>manufactured sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian labour market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, demands the availability of skilled professionals.  
<br/>Into this end, SPEC conducted a skill gap analysis to gather the needs across all the sectors.  The 
<br/>consultations with the public and private sector entities reveal that Fiji’s skilled gap is a repercussion 
<br/>of a persistent mismatch between demand and supply in the Fijian labour market and the years of the 
<br/>mass brain drained the causes of which are very well-known, Sir.  So, in the wake of the pandemic, 
<br/>SPEC’s function has become more critical than ever before and skills are needed in furthering Fijians 
<br/>to a modern skilled based economy to build the nation back stronger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  economy  grows,  Mr.  Speaker,  especially  in  new  and  emerging  sectors  in  order  to 
<br/></span><span>ensure that we are able to actually capitalising opportunities will need those of appropriate skills.  In 
<br/></span><span>this regard, it is critical in this industry to able to access these skills in a timely manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SPEC will actually play an important role in making the transition to a new 
<br/>and modernise economy and continues to do so, we will be enhancing this particular platform for 
<br/>specialised skills to enter Fiji for a short period of time and with the skills gap analysis, our work will 
<br/>be  targeted  and  focus  on  ensuring  that  the  critical  sectors  have  the  required  skills,  Sir.    We  will 
<br/>continue to work closely also with the education sector to introduce new curriculum where possible 
<br/>to build capacity within, Sir.  I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to response, Sir.

<div><span>Available Benefits - Fiji Servicemen Aftercare Fund 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 103/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Economy, Civil Service, Communications, Housing and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the  benefits  available  from  the  Fiji 
<br/>Servicemen’s Aftercare Fund? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for this 
<br/>question.  I understand the honourable Member is a beneficiary under this Aftercare Fund because 
<br/>of the time that he served in the Middle-East. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that brings me a very important point.  The honourable Member has served 
<br/>in the Middle-East but he would know that from 1978 to 1997, all those who actually served in the 
<br/>Middle-East were actually not compensated for death or injury until the Bainimarama Government 
<br/>introduced that.  It was only from 1996 and 1997 onwards that those people received compensation 
<br/>but those who served from 1978 to 1997 did not receive a single cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, they are now part of the Aftercare Fund and in fact, received compensation. Similarly, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government  had  also,  the  Members of Parliament  would remember this, in 
<br/>2014-2015,  we  also  included  those  veterans  who  served  in  Christmas  Island  as  we  all  know  that 
<br/>Christmas  Island  is  where  they  had  the  nuclear  testing  and  those  veterans  actually  suffered,  their 
<br/>families  suffered  because  of  the  radiation  from  the  nuclear  exposure  and  they  were  for  years 
<br/></span><span>struggling and talking about the British to court, to international court of justice, et cetera. As we 
<br/></span><span>know, there are many of the colonising powers in those times including USA and France, et cetera 
<br/>they never paid out compensation in that respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government, again, under the leadership of our Prime Minister and those 
<br/>who  were  here  in  Parliament  will  remember  that  we  actually  had  allocated  a  tune  of  about  $2.5 
<br/>million where we paid a one-off compensation to those veterans with all their family members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  previously,  the  Aftercare  Fund  obviously  apply  to  those  who  served  in 
<br/>World  War  I,  World  War  II  and  of  course,  in  the  Malaya  Campaign  and  Christmas  Island.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the peace keepers of course, who went to Sinai, Lebanon, Golan Heights and Iraq but 
<br/>also we had included in 2014 Police and Prison Officers who also went on peacekeeping duties, they 
<br/>were also included together with the soldiers, as part of the Aftercare Funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, as we all know if the honourable Member wants the monthly 
<br/>allowances, it is paid to ex-servicemen whose wives, spouses, husbands, widows and children and 
<br/>disabled children, Sir.  The allowance for married recipients is $199.40 per month, single recipient 
<br/>is  $124.60,  each  child  recipient  is  eligible  for  $39.25  per  month  and  disabled  child  allowance  is 
<br/></span><span>$99.70. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of recipients varies depending on the death of the recipients and the submission 
<br/>of alive certificate every six months, Sir.  This allocation is directed towards Special Grant, Medical 
<br/>Assistant to the aid for the medical care of the ex-police, RFMF and ex-prison services officers and 
<br/>there dependants in accordance with the Aftercare Fund Act.  Medical Assistance is essential with 
<br/>this aging generation and the fund is required to provide the assistance as and when it is requested 
<br/>by the  recipients,  this  include the purchase of diapers, medication, spectacles, hearing aids,  cane, 
<br/>crutches, wheel-chairs and dialysis treatments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Medical Allowance is requested by recipients when approved is $150.  
<br/>Education Assistance is like Medical Assistance, Education is essential for their moulding care of 
<br/>the children this is a provision for payment of basic stationeries and one pair of uniform for each 
<br/>applicant from primary, secondary schools plus tuition only for the tertiary institution.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also death benefit that is payable to under this particular scheme.  I 
<br/>have got the figures of course, that I can pass on to the honourable Members as to what amounts have 
<br/>been paid with the past number of years.  I have the figures here from 2018, 2019 until the present 
<br/>date and also I have got the financial updates and the utilisation rate.  For example, 2017-2018 a 100 
<br/>percent of what that was provided for was used similarly 2018-2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the revised budget of 2019-2020, Sir, 99 percent was used.  In 2020-2021, 80 percent of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the revised budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and so far 75 percent has been used.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU.- I thank the Attorney-General for the answer.  Only one 
<br/>supplementary question.  Are the medical officers, police officers and the </span><span>talatala</span><span>, deployed with the 
<br/>army to the Middle East, included in that aftercare for servicemen?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, if they are part of the Disciplined Forces, they do get it 
<br/>irrespective of what they do.  For example, if they are member of the RFMF, obviously, they are 
<br/>entitled to it irrespective of what duties they performed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revisions to the 2019/2020 Poverty Rates  
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 104/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the  recent 
<br/>revisions to the 2019/2020 poverty rates by the World Bank and the Fiji Bureau of Statistics? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for the question.  It is unfortunate that the three musketeers are not here, Sir, to hear the 
<br/>response because they are the ones who have been harping on about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is important to note that the Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) with technical assistance 
<br/>from  the  World  Bank  revised  its  poverty  measurement  methodology  in  2019-2020  Household 
<br/>Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) to align with international and regional best practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amongst other things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the major changes to the methodology, Sir, 
<br/>included  the  use  of  household  consumption  aggregates  to  measure  poverty  in  place  of  income 
<br/></span><span>aggregates.  Prior to 2019/2020 HIES, Fiji had been the only Pacific Island country, still using income 
<br/></span><span>aggregates to measure poverty.  There is consensus that consumption measures gives a much more 
<br/>reliable estimate of poverty itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  2019-2020  HIES  results  previously  released  by  FBOS, 
<br/>Fiji’s Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL) stood at $2,179.93 per adult equivalent per year or $41.91 
<br/>per week.  Estimated on this BNPL, the poverty headcount for Fiji was initially estimated at 29.9 
<br/>percent in 2019-2020 which means that an estimated 258,053 individuals were living in poverty at 
<br/>the time of the survey.  Furthermore, at household level, 45,724 households or 22.9 percent were 
<br/>living below the poverty line.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently the World Bank’s poverty and equity global practice team detected 
<br/>a discrepancy in the coding during a crosscheck review exercise to ensure that Fiji’s survey remains 
<br/>in line with international practices.  According to a statement from the World Bank, Fiji’s original 
<br/>consumption aggregate released by FBoS was underestimated due to the omission of select non-food 
<br/>items  resulting  from  a  coding  problem  that  unfortunately  was  not  identified  earlier  on.    The 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consumption  aggregate  for  2019-2020  HIES  was  adjusted  to  ensure  that  all  types  of  household 
<br/>expenditure were fully accounted for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technically,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  review  identified  that  in  the  consumption  aggregate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>estimated from the 2019-2020 HIES, expenditure are on four non-food categories –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Utilities which is electricity, gas, water and garbage collection; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Communications which is telephone, television, internet and postal;    
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Domestic services; and  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Education including school fees and books et cetera was only included for households that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spent on all sub-categories because of the coding issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The revised expenditure measures now represent total spending on any of these items that 
<br/>should have been done in the first place.  As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s poverty rate has been 
<br/>revised  downward  from  29.9  percent  to  24.1  percent.    This  is  the  accurate  figure.  The  National 
<br/>Poverty Line remains virtually unchanged Sir, due to the relatively uniformed distribution of non-
<br/>food expenditures amongst the household and original and revised reference group used to calculate 
<br/>the poverty line. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty  estimates  were  also  revised  downwards  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas  with  larger 
<br/>decreases in  urban areas  than in  rural  areas both in  absolute and relative terms.   This  differential 
<br/>impact  by  area  has  resulted  in  a  higher  concentration  of  poverty  in  rural  areas  with  the  rural 
<br/>population now accounting for 68 percent of Fiji’s poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what do the result show?  Although the results of the 2019-2020 HIES are 
<br/>not  directly  comparable  given  the  change  in  methodology,  we  can  make  some  broad  inferences.  
<br/>Firstly, extreme poverty is almost non-existent in Fiji.  The World Bank defines extreme poverty as 
<br/>a person living on less than $1.90 a day.  Secondly, the poverty rate has always been 24.1 percent as 
<br/>per the 2019-2020 HIES, the earlier report figure of 29.9 percent was incorrect.  This is one of the 
<br/>lowest levels of poverty ever registered in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s poverty trend is as such, in 2001 and 2003 the poverty rate was 35 percent.  In 2008 and 
<br/>2009, it was 31 percent, in 2013-2014 it was 28 percent, in 2019-2020, it was 24 percent.  The most 
<br/>important findings from these corrections, is that based on the current population estimates, it is clear 
<br/>that under the Bainimarama Government and the FijiFirst Government, almost a 100,000 Fijians have 
<br/>been lifted out of poverty Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, 100,000 Fijians and this is a result of the 
<br/>nine years of growth that they do not understand.  Lifting a 100,000 Fijians out of poverty is no small 
<br/>feat,  it  is  a  direct  result  of  the  nine  years  of  consecutive  economic  growth  and  various  social 
<br/>empowerment initiatives like true free education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prof. Prasad claimed that there was free education but then he had to correct 
<br/>himself.  This is the first time that we have people in Fiji who are actually getting free education, free 
<br/>transportation and free textbooks.  The electricity rates are subsidised for households who earns less 
<br/>than $30,000 a year; 50 percent.  Water is subsidised Sir, directly affecting those people who live 
<br/>below a particular income level.  That is where the assistance is coming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course  we  had  before  pandemic  the  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of 
<br/>unemployment; 20 in 20 years.  I would also like to take this opportunity officially to apologise to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1217 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the World Bank about the unbecoming public attack by  honourable Professor Prasad and the </span><span>Fiji 
<br/>Times</span><span> questioning the integrity of the World Bank.  I have fully explained in detail in the press release 
<br/>but because it does not fit their narrative and of course not honourable Gavoka’s narrative, simply 
<br/>they just started blaming everyone else.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would actually be quite shameful for us.  
<br/>Here is the World Bank now lending to us at a concessional rate of zero percent interest rate, 0.75 
<br/>percent service fee, 40 year term and 10 years grace period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again the honourable Member went on a diatribe regarding this.  We want 
<br/>to  emphasise to  Parliament  that contrary to  the  public ramblings of  honourable Professor Prasad, 
<br/>Government played absolutely no part in the revision of poverty statistics.  How can we do that?  It 
<br/>is so out of this world and honourable Gavoka asks, which world are we living in?  Which world are 
<br/>we living in to say that I can go along from Fiji, a country with less than 1 million people to go to the 
<br/>World Bank and say, “Hey guys, just change the figures.”  It is so incredulous to say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Gavoka we do not say that there is no poverty, we have a 
<br/>24 percent poverty rate.  We did not re-engineer Mr. Speaker, Sir, HIES findings to suit our agenda, 
<br/>in fact, we were just as surprised as anyone else.  Although when the figures did come out at 29 
<br/>percent, we were quite surprised but we accepted it because we thought it would actually come down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the coding error of course has picked this up and obviously when the FBOS 
<br/>released  these  figures  originally,  we  had  voiced  a  strong  position  to  some  of  these  findings, 
<br/>particularly in the area of disaggregation, none of them went on about the actual findings of it. They 
<br/>did not talk about rural poverty, maritime poverty;  areas in the urban and peri-urban areas where 
<br/>there is poverty; which children in which areas eat one meal a day or two meals a day; who walked 
<br/>5 kilometres to get to the bus or walked less than 1 kilometre to get to the bus?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  these  important  statistics  were  there.  None  of  them  spoke  about  this.  Honourable 
<br/>Radrodro led the charge all about the ethnicity, all about whoever was leading FBOS at that point in 
<br/>time.  Nothing about the country as a whole from a macro perspective. Nobody looked at that. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir and that is the problem.  Reducing poverty at negligible levels would always remain a 
<br/>key objective of the Government and it should remain a key objective of any Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the take home point of course is this - that the revised figures confirm what 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and what all of the Ministers have been saying - that the policies of 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government are actually working.  It has lifted the 100,000 people out of poverty.  Very 
<br/>basic things like what the Minister for Rural, Maritime Development does, building footpaths, getting 
<br/></span><span>access, giving people access to roads, markets - much cheaper ways; they want to get more for their 
<br/></span><span>produce,  and  even  providing  free  education.  All  of  these  lift  people  out  of  poverty  and  create 
<br/>opportunities for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that clarifies the question that was asked in respect of how the poverty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>level in Fiji have been revised by the World Bank and how poverty in Fiji has been reduced.  
<br/></span></div>
