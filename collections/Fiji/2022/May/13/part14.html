<div><span> HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  adjourns  until  the  next  sitting  date,  as  will  be  determined  in  due 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we adjourn, Honourable Members, I want to thank you all for your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>participation and contribution during the Parliamentary proceedings in the course of this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to inform all Honourable Members that the Commonwealth Women’s 
<br/>Parliamentary  Fiji  Group  will  be  having  their  “Women’s  MPs  Mentoring  Workshop  on  Aspiring  
<br/>Women Politicians” on Wednesday, 18</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 at the Suva Civic Centre, Nadi Civic Centre and 
<br/>the Labasa Civic Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank our honourable  Women Members  of Parliament for their efforts  in  advocating for 
<br/>women’s participation in politics and leadership.  This initiative will, undoubtedly, inspire women 
<br/>from all works of life towards becoming future parliamentarians and more importantly, making a 
<br/>contribution to our national efforts in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG5) Target 5.5 
<br/>on  ensuring  women’s  full  and  effective  participation  and  equal  opportunities  for  leadership  at  all 
<br/>levels of decision making in political, economic and public life.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, before we adjourn, I would just like to apologise to the House for my 
<br/>departure from etiquette earlier today.  As you have noticed, when I came to take my seat, I had to 
<br/>slide across and there is a projection here and it disturbed me, so I sat down automatically.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now declare Parliament adjourned until the next sitting date which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be determined in due course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.54 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
