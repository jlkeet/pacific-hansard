<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as to the second Oral Question for today, I am 
<br/>allowing the question to be asked tomorrow in addition to the questions listed in tomorrow’s Order 
<br/>Paper.  The honourable Minister is indisposed at the moment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Seawall Construction – Kadavu Coastal Villages 
<br/>(Question No. 123/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the construction of seawalls in coastal villages in Kadavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Member  for 
<br/>asking this question.  I do not know why he has only asked for Kadavu when he should be talking 
<br/>about the entire country.  I think they still cannot come out of that initial notion of ‘this is my area, 
<br/>so I will only talk about my area as it is important’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Kadavu  Island,  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  has  completed  coastal 
<br/></span><span>protection works for Namuana Village - 250 metres of seawall and Tavuki District School - 300 
<br/></span><span>metres of seawall, worth $1.2 million.  For the next financial year, we have earmarked nature-based 
<br/>seawall coastal protection works for Wailevu Village  - 300 metres, with an approximate cost of 
<br/>$45,000 and Namuana Village rock boulder extension - 150 metres, with an approximate cost of 
<br/>$30,000.    For  the  next  financial  year,  Wailevu  Village  and  Namuana  Village  are  on  our  list,  of 
<br/>course, subject to funding when we look at the next budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  in addition to those two Villages, we also have requests for Nasau Village - 300 
<br/>metres; Richmond High School - 410 metres; Nabukelevu Primary School - 360 metres; Nasegai 
<br/>Village - 400 metres; Levuka Village - 600 metres, Levuka-i-Yale Village - 280 metres; Dravuwalu 
<br/>Village - 160 metres; Muani Village - 300 metres; Rakiraki Village - 300 metres; and Vabea Village 
<br/>- 300 metres.  Those accumulate to a total length of 3.4 kilometres of coastal protection works that 
<br/>need to be done on Kadavu Island. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  I would like to thank 
<br/>the honourable Minister because in November 2020 when you did the seawall in Namuana, you 
<br/>promised in Wailevu and Nabukelevu that on 21st January, 2021, you were going to complete all 
<br/>those.  Thank you for publicly saying in Parliament that you will do everything, especially in Nasau.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, that is not a supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I supplementary thank him.

<div><span>Awareness on New Processes - Investment Act 2022  
<br/> (Question No. 124/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport inform 
<br/>Parliament on the actions taken by the Ministry to create awareness on the new processes, 
<br/>following the enactment of the Investment Act 2021 and the Investment Fiji Act 2022? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 
<br/>both  the  Investment  Act  2021  and  Investment  Fiji  Act  2022  being  passed  in  Parliament, 
<br/>commencing on 1st August, there was actually some renewed enthusiasm in regards to investments 
<br/>and support for both, our domestic and foreign investors.  These two legislations set the foundation 
<br/>for Fiji in terms of attracting new investments for both, domestic and also for foreign investors. 
<br/>Reforms  are  actually  engineered  towards  the  creation  of  a  conducive  business  environment  and 
<br/>includes providing accelerated response, et cetera, to investors applying for these permits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These investments related to legislative reforms have been an open Government strategy in 
<br/>their attempt towards inclusive growth. The key components, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst developing 
<br/>these  legislations  and  accompanying  regulations  was  actually  transparency,  accountability  and 
<br/>integrity.    The  Technical  Committee  responsible  was  inclusive  of  respective  governmental, 
<br/>statutory organisations as well as our development partners, the World Bank and the IFC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  awareness  mechanism,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  remained  consistent.    It  was  actually 
<br/>targeted  and  tailor-made  to  maximise  outreach  to  relevant  audiences  in  the  best  possible  way; 
<br/>prominence is given to digital platforms and social media channels to put up significant awareness, 
<br/>events and in other words, the aim of awareness raising is to provide adequate information on the 
<br/></span><span>new systems and processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with  the time available, three  months preparation timeframe  from  now 
<br/>until  the  1st  August,  2022,  the  Ministry  is  actually  engaging  with  the  Registrar  of  Companies, 
<br/>digitalFIJI,  all  investment  approval  agencies,  Fiji  Immigration  Department,  Investment  Fiji,  all 
<br/>investment  agents  and  private  sector  representatives.  We  are  actually  taking  the  change  to  the 
<br/>agencies and making them understand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, it is about the authentication of investors through the investment registration process 
<br/>which  will  be  through  the  Registrar  of  Companies  and  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service,  the 
<br/>minimum investment threshold which is across all sectors - a minimum of $300,000 whilst some 
<br/>specific sectors have $500,000 or $1.5 million or $2 million; the reserved and restricted list also of 
<br/>activities and the purposes of the minimum investment threshold and the list of activities that are 
<br/>restricted is to provide adequate protection to our MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of national interest also and the test criteria is to protect certain 
<br/>key sectors that can have a significant impact on the people of Fiji and the national interest.  The 
<br/>foreign investor report requirements is there to maintain data and also to assist implementation and 
<br/>investor permit procedures also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Investment Fiji Act 2022, as we all know that Investment 
<br/>Fiji is a key agency at the helm of this particular transformation, as they transit from a regulatory 
<br/>role to an investment promotion agency. They finalise its marketing and promotional strategy to do 
<br/>targetted campaigns in key markets and also devising strategies for balancing of the resources and 
<br/>development of an action plan to support their path.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Investment  Fiji  continues  to  participate  in  webinars  and 
<br/>seminars  executed  at  both,  national  and  international  level,  seizing  the  opportunity  to  create 
<br/>awareness and share information on the new regime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, throughout  the tenure of this review, we have actually received enormous 
<br/>support and contributions from both, in-house and our development partners, and this has led to 
<br/>development of streamlined and coherent digitally executable legislations attuned to international 
<br/>best practices.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  in  the  coming  months,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  definitely  be  seeing  some 
<br/>positive changes in the investment landscape which will result in better investment opportunities in 
<br/>Fiji.  It is all about capitalising on the strategies for the recovery of our Fijian Economy and the 
<br/>commencement of the two Acts will raise investor confidence and then signal to the world that Fiji 
<br/>is actually open for business. I thank you for allowing me to answer the question, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  Minister:  can  the 
<br/>honourable Minister inform the House on how the new legal framework will ensure protection of 
<br/>the Micro, Small and Medium enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question.  As mentioned earlier, 
<br/>a lot of work has been done in Fiji’s investment. One of the key visions behind the review of the 
<br/>particular Act was to ensure protection of our MSMEs and we assess the current framework which 
<br/>was in place since 1999 and we saw the much needed amendments that were already in place by 
<br/>the Bainimarama Government and then the Fiji First Government to protect our MSMEs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have evaluated the modern market, Mr. Speaker, Sir and determined that MSMEs cannot 
<br/>be protected by simply carving out sectors. It was important that foreign direct investments were 
<br/></span><span>allowed in  certain  sectors as will allow for the development  of the MSMEs around it.  I wish to 
<br/></span><span>highlight, Sir, that this new investment framework is aligned to international best practices, but has 
<br/>been contextualised to meet the needs of the Fijian investment climate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst it can be argued that we have opened or widened the door to foreign investors, we 
<br/>have ensured there still remains enough protection for our local entrepreneurs.  New framework is 
<br/>also protecting our local businesses and at the same time, we are encouraging foreign investments. 
<br/>We actually need more high-end foreign investments in Fiji in sectors which are actually growing, 
<br/>but  we  need  further  enhancement.    We  are  also  encouraging  healthy  competition  for  local 
<br/>businesses, enabling them to get out of their comfort zones and explore the untapped opportunities 
<br/>that are available.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new regulations on reserved and restricted activities provide a minimum threshold of 
<br/>$300,000 for foreign investments in Fiji and in addition, Sir, activities such as fishing, the minimum 
<br/>threshold now features a minimum investment of $1.5 million and for tobacco manufacturers, $1 
<br/>million with 75 percent of locally-grown raw material. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More importantly, investment areas such as homestay, backpackers, motels, guesthouses, 
<br/>Air BNB, et cetera, now feature a minimum investment of a million dollars. These requirements are 
<br/>there  to  protect  our  locals  but  do  not  limit  foreign  investments.  This  will  allow  our  local 
<br/>entrepreneurs to continue undertaking such investments as per their resources and skills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One other strategy, Sir, for the benefit of our domestic investors is the change in dynamics 
<br/>of  Investment  Fiji.  The  role  of  Investment  Fiji  allows  them  to  be  focussed  and  a  fully-fledged 
<br/>investment promotional agency, providing facilitation and aftercare and support to all investors - 
<br/>whether domestic or foreign. I am confident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this new framework will make 
<br/>an enormous impact  in  Fiji’s investment  climate  and our  economy overall.   I thank him for the 
<br/>question, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.-  Thank  you, Mr. Speaker,  I thank the  Honourable  Minister for his 
<br/>response to the question.  My supplementary question is that, can the honourable Minister confirm 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether there are certain businesses that are still reserved for locals or have we opened up the market 
<br/>for competition?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have just answered that.  The reserved and 
<br/>restricted list is different now.  There are some activities that have slightly opened up but there are 
<br/>restrictions on them in terms of how much is being invested.  I suggest you actually read that, it is 
<br/>simpler in its form now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Supply of Fish to PAFCO 
<br/>(Question No. 125/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.W. VOSANIBULA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  update  Parliament  on  the  initiatives  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>place to ensure the supply of fish to PAFCO? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to, at the outset, state that 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government has always supported the operations at PAFCO and will continue to do so.  
<br/></span><span>We support this Government commercial company as it provides employment to the people on the 
<br/></span><span>Island of Ovalau and Lomaiviti Province as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority of the 1,000 workers that are employed at PAFCO are women that work the lines 
<br/>to prepare cooked fish to be vacuumed packed and sent to Bumble Bee in the US for canning.  It is 
<br/>also important to understand the elements that need to be considered when trying to secure tuna 
<br/>being the raw material for PAFCO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put things into context, PAFCO has a capacity to process 30,000 metric 
<br/>tonnes  of  albacore  annually.    In  2018,  PAFCO  was  able  to  process  19,000  metric  tonnes.    This 
<br/>production figure is around 63 percent of PAFCO’s capacity and there is a need to secure around 
<br/>11,000 metric tonnes of albacore for PAFCO to reach its full capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very important to understand that Fiji’s current fleet cannot sustain PAFCO’s albacore 
<br/>demand.  To address this, the Ministry of Fisheries has put out plans to help secure raw materials 
<br/>for PAFCO with the support of line agencies and partners.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fong Chun Formosa 
<br/>(FCF), the acquisition of Bumble Bee, in January 2020, strengthened the basic class sustainability 
<br/>and social responsibility efforts and puts FCF at an advantageous position for sustained growth and 
<br/>leadership throughout the tuna and sea food industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCF being one of the three major players in tuna has integrated into 
<br/>the sector, even more so now, with the acquisition which ensured continuity in terms of supply of 
<br/>tuna to PAFCO for processing and it is in all players’ best interest to ensure ample and consistent 
<br/>supply.  The Ministry will soon be finalising the formulisation of our partnership with FCF, which 
<br/>is currently being vetted to better understand the legal implications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bottom line is we need to attract more fishing vessels to come to Fiji 
<br/>and unload more tuna for PAFCO and other value adding companies.  These plans include holding 
<br/>discussion with Pacific Island States that are Parties to Nauru Agreement (PNA), in particular, with 
<br/>countries that have vast EEZ and have abundant supply of tuna.  The Ministry is working closely 
<br/>with these countries to work out some arrangements and we are also working with the Ministry of 
<br/>Foreign Affairs in these negotiations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an ongoing work being carried out with our bilateral 
<br/>partners who are more advanced and developed when it comes to fishing fleet.  Once Fiji gains 
<br/>access to PNA waters, we will need to have a fleet that has capacity to secure raw materials.  With 
<br/>ongoing discussions, we are looking to secure Purse seines vessels and mother ships  - that joint 
<br/>venture arrangement with our bilateral partners.  This will help us secure tuna from outside Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, one of the best options that the Ministry of Fisheries is working on is the development 
<br/>of multipurpose fishing port.  After clearly assessing the current annual stock and the number of 
<br/>fishing vessels needed to supply raw material not just to PAFCO but other processing facilities, it 
<br/>has been identified that Fiji needs to attract at least 250 vessels to Fiji to meet the current demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These vessels do not need to fish in our EEZ but we are trying to attract them to unload their 
<br/>catch in Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is currently conducting ongoing discussions with the 
<br/>private sector and the investors to help realise this important initiative.  In a nutshell, it is important 
<br/>to understand that the process of securing raw materials for PAFCO is a tough one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For one the fish that we are looking for to secure is not ours. Through our fishing brokers 
<br/>FCF we had been able to secure 19,000 matrix tonnes for our production lines.  What we are trying 
<br/></span><span>to do now is provide a market and a fleet friendly environment to have meet the current shortfall in 
<br/></span><span>raw materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries will continue to work closely with line ministries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on this and we hope to progress this work effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Impact of Commercial Kava Export to Australia 
<br/>(Question No. 126/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and 
<br/>Environment inform Parliament on the impact of commercial kava export to Australia which 
<br/>was approved by the Australian Government in December 2021? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  honourable  Member  for 
<br/>asking the question.  Yes, in December 2021 the Australian Government through DFAT launched 
<br/>a Kava Pilot Programme.  Prior to that kava was not allowed to be exported to Australia so they 
<br/>allowed a Pilot Programme for export of commercial kava consignments into Australia and several 
<br/>of our local exporters took advantage of the opportunity.  It has been five months now since the 
<br/>opening of this pathway area.  In May this  year Fiji has already exported around a total of 30.4 
<br/>metric tonnes of kava to Australia earning around $3.4 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering the short duration we note that this is a substantial gain that we have made.  There 
<br/>are a total of 146 exporters where Fiji is not the only country, there are other countries who are 
<br/>exporting kava, a total of 146 exporters and out of these 146, 94 exporters are from Fiji.  We are 
<br/>basically exporting most of the requirements of the market and there are stringent requirements in 
<br/>terms of what needs to go on the label, the importer details, the lot codes, the country of origin, 
<br/>statements  and  required  warning  statements.    These  are  the  stringent  requirements  that  kind  of 
<br/>hampered uplift or entry of exporters to export to Australia.  This year they have also allowed other 
<br/>variant of kava, let us say kava root chips, kava root powder, whole kava root, as well to be exported 
<br/>to Australia.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the challenges of labelling, we have got good uptake that we have made in the first 
<br/>five months.  Our exporters have been learning along the way and making sure that all requirements 
<br/>are met and there are very limited obstacles to exploring this new kava market and a massive market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a large population in Australia who are from the Pacific, particularly from Fiji, who 
<br/>are consuming kava, they are kava lovers and we want to ensure that we take if not all, a chunk of 
<br/>that market and for that we need to get ready on the ground level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not that we can do this in a month or three months or a year, kava is a long-term crop.  
<br/>Unfortunately Members on the other side do not understand this, they want to do a impact analysis 
<br/>for fencing material in two weeks’ time.  </span><span>Areh</span><span>! We are giving them fencing materials, these are 
<br/>capital investments.  Their impact will in the livestock sector came 15 years to 20 years later.  You 
<br/>cannot have an impact analysis on irrigation materials they are giving now.  We are quite impressed 
<br/>with the uptake and compliance level is about 81 percent.  We had so far no biosecurity issues so 
<br/>we want to thank our exporters for showing an interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to capture this market, if we do not do that, Vanuatu will come in, so I think we 
<br/>are doing extremely well on this.  I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for establishing 
<br/></span><span>this  Vuvale  Partnership  which  is,  this  opening  of  the  kava  market  is  a  response  of  the  Vuvale 
<br/></span><span>Partnership that was established between the two Prime Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Available Facilities for Pap Smear Screening 
<br/>(Question No. 127/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the facilities available to women for Pap Smear Screening? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-    Mr.  Speaker,  cervical  cancer  screening  which  is  pap 
<br/>smear as is commonly known is an essential of health screening component.  With cancer screening, 
<br/>whilst you might be able to pick up those who have cancer, the most important thing is to be able 
<br/>to pick-up disease before they have cancer or the pre-cancerous conditions because if that is treated 
<br/>early, then that person will not have cancer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through awareness and health promotion activities which target the risk factor of cervical 
<br/>cancer, the Ministry has therefore many years and with the support of health partners, the primary 
<br/>care programmes and activities that address the load of cervical cancer in women and girls.  There 
<br/>have been a number of significant actions and achievements against this deadly disease in the last 
<br/>decade.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, Mr. Speaker, we are all aware that our young adolescent daughters have the ability to 
<br/>have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine which was safely introduced and now routinely 
<br/>given to all Year 8 female students in Fiji since 2013.  This vaccine is known to be able to prevent 
<br/>or reduce the likelihood of cancer because the virus is able to change the cells as the lady keeps on 
<br/>growing and make it cancerous if it continues within the woman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the establishment of Fiji’s Cervical Cancer Screening Policy in 2015 which has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>guided our actions so far which we continue to review and update.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly,  the  procurement  of  the  automated  liquid-based  ThinPrep  cytology  screener 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>machine to assist a centralised pathological diagnosis at CWM Hospital.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourthly, strengthening of the Ministry’s collaboration with other stakeholders such as Fiji 
<br/>Cancer Society, Medical Services Pacific, Reproductive and Family Health Association of Fiji to 
<br/>better  co-ordinate  the  services  provided  to  women  and  girls  and  also  the  work  with  multilateral 
<br/>partners such as WHO, UNFPA, to name are few.  Endorsing a cost benefit analysis by WHO in 
<br/>2011-2022 on the introduction of HPV testing which test for the HPV virus that causes cervical 
<br/>cancer, ThinPrep pap smear technique which uses the machine at CWM and the visuals packed with  
<br/>acidic gas  testing in Fiji.  The outcome of this analysis will form the upcoming cervical cancer 
<br/>policy review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  aim  of  accelerating  and  elimination  of  cervical  cancer,  the  Ministry  supports 
<br/>WHO’s three recommended three key steps of vaccination with HPV vaccination for our adolescent 
<br/>daughters, screening which is either pap smear or the ThinPrep and treatment to reduce by more 
<br/>than  40  percent  the  number  of  new  cervical  cancer  cases  and  deaths  of  the  year  2050.    With 
<br/>vaccination,  the  National  HPV  vaccination  campaign  targeting  young  women  or  young  ladies 
<br/>between 9 and 12 in schools was introduced in 2008 as a pilot, later introduced as a routine vaccine 
<br/>in 2013 through the bilateral support of DFAT and now fully funded by Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  introduction  of  the  HPV  vaccination  programme  as  a  primary  prevention 
<br/></span><span>mechanism  for  cervical  cancer  caused  by  human  papilloma  virus  infection  was  a  significant 
<br/></span><span>development against this disease.  The vaccination is available across all health facilities in all health 
<br/>divisions in Fiji throughout our school health vaccination programme.  For screening, the campaign 
<br/>target for 2030 is to achieve 80 percent of the women screened using a high performance test by 
<br/>age 35 and again by 45. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Screening  has  been  further  strengthened  as  I  have  alluded  to  earlier  with  the  ThinPrep 
<br/>Screening  Machine  at  the  CWM  Hospital  and  the  machine  can  contentiously  screen  more  than 
<br/>40,000 tests per year picking up the abnormal results for further assessment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The introduction of the  ThinPrep Screening machine  has  greatly improve the efficacy in 
<br/>screening process and accuracy in diagnosis.  It has been estimated the accuracy against for thin 
<br/>prep versus Pap smear can even up to more than 50 percent more efficient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The strengthening of the cervical cancer screening is also created an opportunity to screen 
<br/>for breast cancer. The screening process for both, cervical and breast cancer, is done by the Ministry 
<br/>in partnership with the Fiji Cancer Society, MSP and Reproductive Health of Fiji but the screening 
<br/>was affected  during the COVID-19 outbreak in Fiji we have started strengthening the procurement 
<br/>process of nurses and commodities.  We have started to skill up again the screening for all eligible 
<br/>women with the support of our partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, with the treatment, the Ministry continued to strengthen throughout the purchase and 
<br/>upgrade of medical equipment. There is an ongoing training for doctors and nurses who provide 
<br/>specialist gynaecological care for women and girls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cervical  Cancer  clinic  is  available  in  all  health  centres,  subdivisions  and  Divisional 
<br/>Hospitals and had selected nursing stations where nurses have been trained to be able to do the Pap 
<br/>smear of the ThinPrep. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honourable Member for that question and those are the answers I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have provided.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Can I just ask a supplementary question.  Screening for Pap smear 
<br/>and breast is very important to the women.  Honourable Minister, I understand that the free PAP

<div><span>Smear testing that normally done at the  Oxfam Women’s Wellness Clinic is no longer in place.  
<br/>When can we women expect this service to be up and running? I know you have mentioned that 
<br/>they can go to other facilities but in particular the Women Wellness Centre the one at Brown Street, 
<br/>Honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR I. WAQAINABETE.-  That Centre was throughout COVID closed because we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were using it as  part of the hospital and it was also part of the COVID process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we speak screening is available in other areas but I have been told by my 
<br/>team that they are moving the team back into that centre. It will happen in the next few weeks or 
<br/>so.  As I have alluded to earlier, it was closed throughout COVID with all the spaces in the hospital 
<br/>had to be allocated for COVID cases.

<div><span>Sustainability of Fiji’s Debt 
<br/>(Question No. 128/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/></span><span>Communications, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament on why Fiji’s 
<br/>debt remains sustainable and cannot be compared to the Sri Lankan crisis? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see the three stooges now and actually 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they disappeared again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in fact, at the behest of honourable Professor Prasad and his colleagues or whatever you 
<br/>want to call them, they are the ones who raised this issue and actually compared Fiji to Sri Lanka 
<br/>and said that we are in the same boat as Sri Lanka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the interest of time, I will 
<br/>be very brief but essentially to highlight and people can ask supplementary questions, if they do 
<br/>want to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference between Fiji and Sri Lanka is a world of difference.  Firstly, 
<br/>Sri Lanka does not have adequate foreign reserves available in their country.  It has $7 billion due 
<br/>in external debt repayments alone but only had $2 billion in foreign exchange; $7 billion to pay 
<br/>offshore but only $2 billion.  Fiji’s external debt repayments on average is just around $100 million 
<br/>annually and we have $3 billion available in foreign reserves.  That is 30 times more than what is 
<br/>needed for external debt repayments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has over 10 times more revenue available to service its debt.  
<br/>Our current revenues are over $3 billion and debt servicing is just over $350 million.  For Fiji to be 
<br/>able  to  not  service  our  debt,  our  revenue  will  have  to  fall  to  below  $300  million.    Even  during 
<br/>COVID-19,  Sir,  which  was  a  one-in-a-hundred-year  event,  we  managed  to  maintain  revenue  at 
<br/>around $2 billion.  This basically shows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why Fiji has never defaulted on debt and 
<br/>why we will never default on debt.  Sri Lanka’s revenue situation is completely different.  Simply, 
<br/>it is too low and cannot be compared to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly,  Sri  Lanka’s  lenders  stopped  lending  to  them.    Our  lenders  have  recently  been 
<br/>lending us five times more than what they were lending before, and continue and want to lend.  They 
<br/>are all credible lenders, they are not some fly-by-night lenders.  They are the World Bank, Asian 
<br/>Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Asian Infrastructure 
<br/>Investment Bank (AIIB) and other domestic institutional investors.  For them to want to lend more

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Fiji even during COVID-19 means they fully know, understand and appreciate the economic and 
<br/>financial management capacity of Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourthly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  have  previously  mentioned  in  Parliament,  we  have 
<br/>accessed $900 million in the past two years in highly concessional debt from JICA and International 
<br/>Development Association (IDA), which is through the World Bank.  We have long-term maturity 
<br/>of 40 years, 10-year grace period, net-zero interest rate and other JICA loans, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at 
<br/>15-year terms with four-year grace period and near zero interest rate.  Our debt repayment is spread 
<br/>over  many  years,  while  Sri  Lanka’s  debt  repayments  or  bonds  had  to  be  paid  in  lump  sum 
<br/>immediately.  Like the Qarase Government, it had five-year bond in 2006.  It was due five years 
<br/>later in a lump sum.  That puts immediate pressure on the fifth year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  why  they  have  a  lot  of  confidence  is  that,  we  have  been 
<br/>borrowing for capital expenditure.  As highlighted in Parliament previously, we had an operating 
<br/>surplus,  in  other  words,  we  had  that  much  revenue  that  when  we  paid  for  all  our  everyday 
<br/>operational expenditure, we still had the surplus which we then directed towards capital expenditure 
<br/>and  then  borrowed  more  for  capital  expenditure.    Obviously,  those  expenditures  in  capital 
<br/>investment will give us a debt return.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  obviously  cannot  be  compared  to  Sri  Lanka  and  I  was  quite 
<br/>flabbergasted  that  you  have  organisations,  like  </span><span>Fiji  Times</span><span>  and  CFL,  given  this  person  has  lost 
<br/>absolute credibility.  Neelesh Gounder and Wadan Narsey writing up all these articles and this is 
<br/>what we continuously say, for their own political purposes, they are quite happy to undermine our 
<br/>country publically and not just domestically, but internationally, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, like I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on about a lot more in details.  Now, for example 
<br/>if you look at the interest rates that we pay or what we call the yields, the cost of debt, weighted 
<br/>average interest rate in January 2020, it was 6.2; January 2021, it was 5.2;  January 2022, it was 4.6.  
<br/>Refinancing risk from 8.1 to 10.8, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that was lower risk.  Interest rate risk, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, again, improving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our foreign risk in terms of foreign debts is about 31.2 percent in respect 
<br/>of our total exposure.  So, we are now in a very good space in that respect, Mr. Speaker, Sir and 
<br/>then we continuously said, please, and honourable Professor Prasad is notorious with this. Notorious 
<br/>with  this!    For  short-term  political  gain,  he  gets  all  his  mates  lined  up,  gets  all  these  media 
<br/>organisations to just berate, to make Government look bad but it is not about Government.  It is 
<br/>about the country.  It is about our people.  It is about undermining confidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have said continuously that I mean they want to change government, 
<br/>if they do come on this side, God forbid, but if they do theoretically then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what 
<br/>will happen?  They will have to deal with the lack of confidence that they have created in the market 
<br/>and they will very quickly realise they have to deal with the market and the market has a very long 
<br/>term memory.  It does not believe just because the Government says that all is hunky-dory; banks 
<br/>have  a  long  term  memory,  institutional  investors  have  a  long  term  memory,  so  to  continuously 
<br/>assault the Fijian economy is just for short term political gain.  The honourable Member who was 
<br/>sworn in knows exactly what I am talking about.  She is in the private sector.  There needs to be an 
<br/>appreciation of that.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
