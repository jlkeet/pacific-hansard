<h3>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament, 
<br/>yesterday, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022, be debated, voted upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM-. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of time and also to allow the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other Members to have more time to be able to respond to this motion, I will be very brief.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially,  as  discussed  yesterday  in  presenting  this  particular  Bill  to  Parliament,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this seeks to regularise a long outstanding matter that is being languishing within the 
<br/>legal doldrums because no one could find a legal way out given on one hand, the restrictions placed 
<br/>by the law, and the realities on the ground.  So we have people from decades living on land where 
<br/>it is acknowledged that they should remain there, yet there is no legal ability for them to be able to 
<br/>access proper title by way of lease that could be granted by the  State on all persons residing on 
<br/>Crown land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  introductory  remarks,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  just  end  there  but 
<br/>essentially to highlight to all honourable Members of the Parliament that this would, in fact, bring 
<br/>about  enormous  levels  of  relief  to  thousands  of  Fijians.    It  would  also  ensure  that  the  Lands 
<br/>Department is able to issue proper leases and will also increase the value of the land that they reside 
<br/>on.  They  would  be  able  to  mainstream  into  the  financial  system,  be  able  to  access  loans  from 
<br/>mainstream  banks,  financial  institutions,  including  organisations  like,  Housing  Authority,  build 
<br/>proper homes, build resilience and at the same time, of course, ensure that the legal basis of all land 
<br/>titles and all land leases are done within a legal framework, which gives a lot of overall confidence 
<br/>to ordinary members of the public and, indeed, the economy overall.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand and appreciate the need to rectify 
<br/>the issues that have been highlighted in this Bill, but we must again, stress, our disappointments in 
<br/>the manner this Bill has been brought to Parliament.  We know it needs to be done, but these are 
<br/>very  sensitive  and  contentious  issues.    We  could  have  allowed  one  month  for  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Natural Resources to conduct consultation and bring the Bill back to Parliament to 
<br/>go through the normal process of passing legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  speaking  yesterday,  the  honourable  Minister  had  indicated  that  he  had  held 
<br/>consultations with the people, but a particular and very important segment was not consulted, and 
<br/>these are the traditional landowners of these State lands.  As I have stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>want to see this matter to be resolved.  It has been languishing for quite some time, but anything to 
<br/>do with land, must not be done in haste.  We have said this over and over again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about the land around the Malolo area and when we visited 
<br/>the  villagers  of  Moala,  they  shared  with  us  an  experience  where  they  were  invited  to  a 
<br/>commissioning of a project that occurred in the land adjacent to the village, the State land, but were 
<br/>part of the opening as landowners.  They asked themselves the question, “Why are we invited here, 
<br/>why are we being pampered by the developers?”, when they knew that the land was theirs initially 
<br/></span><span>but was currently under State land.  That appears to be the situation in most parts of the country 
<br/></span><span>today, where the landowners are used to be part of the blessings for a project, but knowing fully 
<br/>well that they do not ownership on that particular land.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want  to  rectify this,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We want  people to  be secured in  their lands, 
<br/>whoever is covered in this lease, we want them to be secured, but we want the traditional landowners 
<br/>to have a say in this, and in fact, put in place the process to identify who the owners are and give 
<br/>the land back to them.  When we say that, we do not mean to say that they will take the land away 
<br/>from the tenants.  We will protect the tenants, we will secure their tenancy and they will enjoy all 
<br/>the benefits they have been given, but the land must go back to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  are  a  lot  of  land  in  Fiji  under  this  arrangement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  
<br/>Yesterday, we spoke about Navakai, Qeleloa, Denarau; these are all the lands that need to be used 
<br/>for development.  We want development.  Of course, we want development but do not leave out the 
<br/>landowners in the equation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what that is happening here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to be inclusive, we want to 
<br/>move forward.  We thank the Government for the development but an important element to this is 
<br/>the concern, the participation, and it is the benefits that goes to the landowners.  This is a way ahead 
<br/>for  SODELPA  and  this  is  what  we  will  do.    We  will  encourage  development,  we  will  make  it 
<br/>available  but  everyone  will  be  on  the  same  boat  travelling  together.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will 
<br/>include the landowners in everything;  when  you  leave them  out  there is  contention  and there is 
<br/>insecurity in our land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  many  land  that  come  under  this  and  include  Manoko  Flats, 
<br/>Navua, Kalabu, there are many in Fiji and we need to resolve them.  There is a lot of goodwill from 
<br/>the landowners, there is a story told to me by the people of Yako. Their land in Waicoba, about 70 
<br/>leases had expired.  They wanted to do something with it.  The Government prevailed upon them 
<br/>to renew the cane ALTA leases for the sake of the sugar industry which they did in good faith in 
<br/>Waicoba.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the lease was given the tenants sold the land at a higher 
<br/>price and with very little benefit to the landowners.  So, this good must be respected.  Do not just 
<br/>come here and talk about development, enrich everyone else and leave the landowners holding an 
<br/>empty bag.

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1335 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as stated… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment is to the State Lands Act, 
<br/>but the honourable Member is now talking about </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land that was leased and he is, therefore, 
<br/>now trying to obscure. We are specifically talking about State land but he is now bringing </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>land where he said that </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land was leased out consented to by the landowners and the tenants 
<br/>then sold it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As he would also know Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you have an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> lease you cannot sell it, you 
<br/>cannot subdivide it without the consent of iTLTB and the landowners. He knows that, and he is now 
<br/>bringing  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land  into  discussions  on  State  land;  this  is  what  we  had  said  continuously 
<br/>yesterday.  In the introduction, I said that this is to do with State land not </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land and he has 
<br/>brought that about now, again, trying to mislead because for them, it is political order – that is what 
<br/>it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-Honourable Member keep to the agenda.  The agenda is on State land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Thank  you,  Mr. Speaker.   I was  referring to  that to indicate the 
<br/>goodwill within the landowning community, a goodwill that must be returned.  The way you are 
<br/>going about this, you said it yesterday!  There was no consultation with the traditional landowners 
<br/>in the area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We know it is State land… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  the  honourable  Member  in  his 
<br/>political clamouring is misrepresenting what we said. I never mentioned about no consultation with 
<br/>landowners, I never said that.  Please, read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.  Please do not mislead Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>he talked about 
<br/>consultation, he did not mention the local community</span><span>.</span><span>  All we want is to be inclusive in this country.  
<br/>What you are doing is fine but please do it in an inclusive manner.  That is all we are trying to say.  
<br/>You are leaving them out, you know that some of these issues are contentious.  Take the time to 
<br/>consult  us. We all want  to  move forward.  We  want  to  be part of this,  we want  to  progress  the 
<br/>country but do it in an inclusive manner that is all we are saying here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have said it many times - you have to uplift the economic wellbeing 
<br/>of the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> in  this country.   Anything like this that benefits  them,  you must take the time to 
<br/>include them in the dialogue.  That is why we are opposing this Bill.  We believe it could have been 
<br/>done better.  Again, I say, it is something that needs to be done, the Government has brought it into 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1336 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Parliament, it is to be done but do it properly, do it in an inclusive manner so that everyone can 
<br/>progress together in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute and support 
<br/>Bill No. 26 of 2022 to amend the State Lands Act of 1945.  This issue is one of the hottest issues in 
<br/>the Nadi area and numerous people who have approached us because of this situation on State land 
<br/>around the Nadi area, especially over the last 10 years when farmers were told to vacate their land 
<br/>by the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of areas in Nadi, especially suburbs like Nasau, Sonaisali and Navakai, as alluded to 
<br/>by the  Leader of the Opposition and I thank him for highlighting those facts  which indicate the 
<br/>Opposition’s support for the Bill before the House.  Sir, some of those landlords have sold their 
<br/>blocks for $10,000 to $20,000 and most of these blocks are close to the areas that they personally 
<br/>live  in.    In  some  instances,  the  landlord  has  migrated  overseas  and  basically  continue  to  sell  or 
<br/>receive income from these sitting tenants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act provides that, at the time of making the application for a lease or 
<br/>licence under the Act,  any person who makes an arrangement or agreement to  permit  any other 
<br/></span><span>person to acquire land in respect of which his or her application is being made, should have the 
<br/></span><span>permission or notice given by the Director of Lands of any such arrangement and cannot be given 
<br/>a lease under the Act without this permission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some instances, however, occupants of the land, as a result of dispossession of land due 
<br/>to political upheaval or cancellation of non-renewal of leases or licences resort to take refuge in 
<br/>these pieces of land and there has never been any formal work done to formalise the tenancy that 
<br/>they occupy till today.  So the lessees who permitted such person to use the land, in this instance, 
<br/>however did not obtain the consent of the Director of Lands making the arrangement unlawful under 
<br/>the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act will ensure that no person being the holder or lessee or licensee 
<br/>under this Act may enter into making an arrangement or agreement to permit any other person to 
<br/>sell,  give  away  or  allow  them  to  build  on  that  piece  of  land.    So,  it  is  very  clear  and  it  is  very 
<br/>imminent that this Act must be changed to accommodate all these issues.  I am 110 percent sure 
<br/>that the Opposition will only oppose this Bill with the excuse that the Bill has come under Standing 
<br/>Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It’s always the case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Always! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, on the Government side, know and expect this as the Opposition do not have any other 
<br/>post to lean on.  Honourable Members of this august Parliament and the people of Fiji are fed up 
<br/>with the Opposition for dragging on … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- … and delaying all these necessary  changes. The 
<br/>changes are required – it is imminent and necessary.  All the Opposition does is to drag it along this 
<br/>Chamber to delay the formalisation of these sales. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very clear in the Standing Orders, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Standing Orders allows it.  
<br/>There is a provision in the Standing Orders for us to change laws, to change rules that are imminent 
<br/>and required immediately, and that is Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe I should educate the Opposition Members of what is contained in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 51.  It states in Standing Order 51(1), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A motion requesting that Parliament consider a Bill without delay– 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>may be moved without notice; and 
<br/>shall be moved by the member moving the Bill.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exactly, what the honourable Attorney-General is doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is wrong with you?  What is the matter?  The rule needs to be changed, the laws 
<br/>need to be changed.  Come on, be an adult, come on board and let us change it.  Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by the 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Attorney-General,  but  before  I  do  so,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  and  thank 
<br/>honourable Mere Naulumatua for a wonderful statement this morning.  As they say, she took 
<br/>the words right out of my mouth – something that we have been saying all along.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As much as  I would like PAP’s other half, the  honourable Members of  the National 
<br/>Federation Party (NFP) sitting in this Parliament to take that on board, I doubt very much that 
<br/>that is going to happen.  They have been walking around in a cul-de-sac all this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  my  Government  has  implemented  legislative  reforms  and  innovative 
<br/>strategies for the benefit of all Fijians.  These new measures were undertaken with extensive 
<br/>consultations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Government saw a need to  reform archaic legislation that  hindered 
<br/>socio-economic development and facilitate support measures for those affected.  We provide 
<br/>opportunities for Fijians to not only own their own homes through our First Home Purchase 
<br/>Programme but to also regularise informal tenants who reside on certain land and in this case, 
<br/>as we have heard, State land.  If my Government was irresponsible, Mr. Speaker, we could have 
<br/>just  allowed  tenants  to  settle  in  informal  settlements  and  to  have  an  insecure  future  but  as 
<br/>everyone knows, that is not my Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we do things the right way by ensuring that Fijians not only have homes 
<br/>and formal leases, but can also access financial systems and proper services, such as electricity, 
<br/>clean  water,  footpaths  and  roads.    In  essence,  this  Bill  ensures  the  very  important  and 
<br/>fundamental right of every Fijian.  According to Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji, Government must take reasonable measures within its available resource to achieve the 
<br/>progressive realisation of the right of every person to access adequate housing and sanitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This amendment, Mr. Speaker, will allow Fijians who are currently residing on State 
<br/>land and have obtained informal approval from the lawfully registered lessee to formalise these 
<br/>arrangements.  In many cases, the initial registered lessee cannot be located or simply does not 
<br/>have the capacity to be able to subdivide the land which was sold without consent many years 
<br/>prior.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>1338 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Director of Lands, through this amendment to the State Lands Act, will 
<br/>have the proper authority to re-enter such land or cancel a lease for such purposes.  However, 
<br/>there are certain clear guidelines on how to go about this before any decision can be made.  That 
<br/>is, a Committee headed by the Permanent Secretary for Housing and Community Development 
<br/>must first  determine any contravention to  the State  Lands Act  and then propose  a course  of 
<br/>action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are proper checks and balances, Mr. Speaker, in place to ensure that there is no abuse 
<br/>of this authority and that each case is reviewed thoroughly before determining the best way forward 
<br/>for  all  parties  involved.  An  important  outcome  of  regularising  land  is  that  occupants  will  have 
<br/>security of land tenure to be able to build permanent homes.  Leaseholders will be mainstreamed 
<br/>into the financial system and will be able to use their land titles as collateral when they approach 
<br/>financial institutions for bank loans and other services including insurance to rebuild their properties 
<br/>in the event of a national disaster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also want to ensure that properties are built to quality standard. Improper 
<br/>leasing creates a lot of uncertainty for occupants. This is reflected in the types of houses they built 
<br/>which  are  more  often  than  not  unable  to  withstand  the  ferocity  of  national  disasters.    The  best 
<br/></span><span>approach for any disaster, Mr. Speaker, is to be prepared by building resilient infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A key strategy of my Government is to develop and enforce building standards for home 
<br/>construction that require improved resilience to cyclones and flooding as outlined in the National 
<br/>Development  Plan.    The  Fijian  Government  is  committed  to  growing  our  economy,  supporting 
<br/>ordinary Fijians and improving their livelihoods and for greater sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in summary this amendment to the State Lands Act will assist many Fijians 
<br/>who have, for years, faced uncertainty in securing proper lease titles. They will be provided with 
<br/>opportunity  to  safeguard  their  families’  lives  and  their  future  generation.    This  reaffirms  my 
<br/>Government’s commitment to leaving no one behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on these remarks, Mr. Speaker, I do support the amendment to the State Lands Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, on that note we will take a break for morning tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.32 a.m.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1339 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.06 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate and I give the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor to the honourable Anare Jale.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to the debate 
<br/>on the amendment to the State Lands Act 1945.  I do not know the history of the parcels of land in 
<br/>question or the Bill relates to but the only thing I know is that they were </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land before, but 
<br/>now are State land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The State took over the land for its purpose either for sugarcane planting or for something 
<br/>else but the intent has changed, so there are issues about the land that the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>owners, traditional 
<br/>owners have, Sir, that need to be heard.  That is the reason why we have been saying all along that 
<br/>we need consultation on important issues such as the one that we are talking about particularly land.  
<br/>We should hear the stakeholders.  The  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners are stakeholders and they need to be 
<br/>given the right to comment on bills that affect their rights and their livelihoods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I say the intent of the Act is good but the way the Act is drafted is questionable.  It needs 
<br/></span><span>to be looked at and I will cite some of the areas of the Bill that may need to be considered so that 
<br/></span><span>the intent is not lost.  We focus on the intent of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me refer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to Explanatory Note Paragraph 1.4.    It says, “Furthermore, 
<br/>many of the lessees cannot be located or do not have the capacity to subdivide the land which they 
<br/>sold a number of years ago.  By amending the Act, we will be able to regularise the occupation of 
<br/>these lands and allow the occupants to build permanent homes through the mainstream financial 
<br/>system.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What needs to be noted here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a situation where the lessees sold State land 
<br/>to  illegal  buyers.    Both  knew  that  the  land  belong  to  the  State  but  they  went  ahead,  engaged 
<br/>themselves in illegal dealings.  I think that should be taken into account because this Act is trying 
<br/>to regularise or formalise illegal dealings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lessees and the buyers have breached the law by engaging in illegal sales.  Both parties 
<br/>have committed offences and should be charged. We should not be going after the lessees only, we 
<br/>should go for the people who have been part of the dealing of this illegal sale.  It is a concern that 
<br/>the  Bill  proposes  to  regularise  the  illegal  dealings  by  formalising  lease  arrangement  with  those 
<br/>illegal occupants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am suggesting is that, the Government should consider vacating the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>land, all of them to go out because they are illegal tenants, illegal occupants, let us start fresh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Where will they go? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- You have to find out where they should go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- The people of Fiji must be given the right to their land - all of them.  Why 
<br/>should we be giving the right to the people who came there illegally, meaning illegal buyers of the 
<br/>land?  They should be vacated and prosecuted, not the way that this Bill is proposing that the land 
<br/>be regularised and they will be formalised as legal tenants.  I think this is wrong and we should not 
<br/>support it.  That is the reason why I am not supporting this Bill.

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  thank you for the opportunity to speak to this 
<br/>particular  Bill  -  a  Bill  to  amend  the  State  Lands  Act  1945.    I  think  the  Bill  is  trying  to  address 
<br/>something that is a big problem that we have with a lot of State lands.  One is the problem of people 
<br/>just building illegally on State land and the other is that when people have taken leases on State land 
<br/>and they go into these illegal dealings and some of them sell pieces of land illegally without the 
<br/>consent of the Director of Lands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of these people are very poor people, we are talking here about people that have hardly 
<br/>anything to their name and everyone is looking for a bit of stability, a sense of security so in good 
<br/>faith they talk to the people that have the leases and illegally, they have these sorts of transactions.  
<br/>This is something that everyone who has served as Minister of Lands assume this problem occur 
<br/>over and over again; these illegal transactions happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When this comes to the notice of the Ministry of Lands now, what we do is that when the 
<br/>lease finishes off, their lease is taken over but the people that are residing there, the portion of the 
<br/>land in which their home is, is then leased to them while the rest of them if it is agricultural land, it 
<br/>is then given out for people that want to be farmers.  It is a big problem that is perennially happening 
<br/>all the time, so any measure that we can have to try to address this, at the same time give powers to 
<br/></span><span>the Director of Lands to be able to take the land back to cancel the lease if something that will help 
<br/></span><span>us to stop this problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a big problem, we have a lot of problems with people using State land in a way that it 
<br/>is not meant for, and measures that we have in place that allow us to address this to move us forward 
<br/>is something that we will always support because we want to make sure at all times that State land 
<br/>is used in the manner that it is supposed to be used.  But at the same time, the people that are living 
<br/>there have hardly anything to their name, we also have to look after their interests and try to make 
<br/>sure that we can give them some security for their lives into the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there are some people have suggested that this might lead to more people building on 
<br/>State land illegally in this way, there will be measures that we have put in place with the work of 
<br/>the  Committee  and  the  work  with  the  different  Government  agencies  including  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources, to try to see that this is minimised as much as possible.  Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my response to Section 16 of the State 
<br/>Lands (Amendment) Act.  It does not make any sense, why Government is legislating a provision 
<br/>of the lease agreement. We all know that any occupancy, apart from what was initially consented 
<br/>by the Director of Lands are unlawful under lease agreement.  Neither do I find that land being sold, 
<br/>where Director of Lands has not consented because to do so, is fraud.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, that being said, last month we saw the Investment Act and also the Informal Settlement 
<br/>Act both these laws were rushed in this august Parliament through Standing Order 51.  Now, we all 
<br/>know that land is always secret to anyone regardless of their ethnicity, race, gender or social status. 
<br/>This is election’s year and we will soon be hearing that we all pitching our elections pitches here.  
<br/>Let us all be frank about it, call it what it may, it is elections that  sadly all political parties present 
<br/>and gone will now dangle the carrots to our  voters when the need arises.  I am glad that our voters 
<br/>are better informed, better educated and the fate of all members in this august Parliament is in their 
<br/>hands.  That being said, I only wish that issues of land more so  affordable housing were brought to 
<br/>this august Parliament much earlier as housing more so is a priority to any person.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  last  month  I  had  mentioned  that  the  Housing  Authority  concept  of 
<br/>providing  affordable  housing  is  not  working  and  now  we  see  a  rush  law  that  will  somewhat  or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>somehow alleviate affordable housing for all our people.  Do not get us wrong, we wholeheartedly 
<br/>support affordable decent housing for all our people but the process must be thought out properly 
<br/>because a lot of stakeholders will be affected.  Any person squatting and hearing this Bill may be 
<br/>thinking that their housing issue is finally solved.  Unfortunately, it will not because to benefit under 
<br/>this Bill: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>An arrangement must be in place between the lessee and the occupants of the land.  So, if 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is no arrangement this Bill does not benefit you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>This arrangement is done without the consent of the Director of Lands.  So, if the Director 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Lands has not consented, again this Bill does not benefit you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there is no arrangement in place between the lessee and the squatters or the occupants of 
<br/>the land and the Director of Lands has not consented, the informal settlement law that we passed 
<br/>last month will be a whip on your back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also said last month that there have been unprecedented squatter settlements from Lami to 
<br/>Nausori for the past 15 years.  When I was at SCC, we controlled squatter settlements within the 
<br/>Suva Municipality boundary and we controlled it well. We engaged with the squatters and we work 
<br/></span><span>with them, they are part and parcel of any municipality.  But the ultimate understanding was, they 
<br/></span><span>were staying on land that they had no legal tenure and that one day the lessee or the landowner will 
<br/>come and reclaimed what is legally theirs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have political interference from Qarase’s Government and also under the Bainimarama 
<br/>Government and our Enforcement Officers could not remove squatters from SCC land, as they were 
<br/>told that Government does not allow the removal, such a hypocrisy where their legal process is in 
<br/>place and Government usurped their roles over the laws.  I say this because I had experienced it at 
<br/>Suva City Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my concern is that, when land is subdivided and sold, will the squatters be 
<br/>able to afford these lots?  Or will it give rise to investors or the rich and the elite to move in and 
<br/>buying these lots when the squatters cannot afford it.  Thus deviating from the intent of this Bill. 
<br/>We need to have a clear legal guideline on this, hence, we are saying proper consultation with all 
<br/>stakeholders need to be taken into account, do not rush this like all your other laws where we find 
<br/>ourselves caught in the back foot of legal challenges in court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my second concern is subdivide the land, sold at a higher price and the 
<br/>squatter moves onto to another State land and looks who is abusing the system.    We have squatters 
<br/>selling their homes not the land, $15,000 to $20,000 then another one moves in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Honourable Waqanika is really meandering. The Bill that is before us is to do with State 
<br/>Land on which there are no squatters.  It is to do with land where there is already somebody who 
<br/>has a lease and that person has then allowed other people at a price or sometimes without a price to 
<br/>come and build homes there. What the honourable Member is talking about is squatter land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The difference between Squatter land and State land is that, the Squatter land is where people 
<br/>have  just  simply  gone  and  built  on  that  particular  land  without  anyone’s  approval  and  without 
<br/>having a lease over it. That is what you call a “Squatter” and there is huge difference between the 
<br/>Bill that was passed by Parliament in the last sitting and what we are talking about now.  Sir, the 
<br/>Bill  that  was  passed  the  other  sitting,  was  about  where  the  Government  has  acquired  a 
<br/>developmental lease to formalise an informal settlement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>1342 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In most cases, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the lands are </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, so we have gone out and 
<br/>spoken to the landowners.  They have through the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Land Trust Board (iTLTB) agreed to 
<br/>give us  a development  to lease and in  that lease land, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we are then paying the 
<br/>money to the landowners, on behalf of these people who were paying </span><span>Vakavanua</span><span> arrangements and 
<br/>we want to then subdivide the land, build roads, water, electricity and all those types of utilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And in instances where people do not move their house to realign, that is when we have the 
<br/>law  that  allows  us  to  help  them  to  move  so  that  they  can  still  have  that  land.  The  honourable 
<br/>Waqanika, is actually misleading Parliament by mixing both of them. We are not talking about that, 
<br/>we are talking about State land when there is a lease and somebody has gone ahead without a consent 
<br/>of a Director given people the right to go and leave in those lands. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Unless I am reading the Explanatory Note incorrectly.  In 1.3, it 
<br/>says in some instances however, the occupants of the land have as a result of dispossession of land 
<br/>or due to political upheaval, cancellation or non-renewable of the leases and licences in order to 
<br/>seek refuge on other land which they were not lessees  under the Act. My understanding is that, this 
<br/>is a State land, people have stayed on it without the two elements that I have mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> So, my concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am addressing you, most of these so called “abandoned 
<br/></span><span>leases” may have annual lease rent being paid by the lessee and they allow squatters to reside on 
<br/>the land based on humanitarian ground.  The goodwill and humanitarian ground given by the lessee 
<br/>to the squatters is not appreciated by this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The case in point is what I have mentioned about earlier. The Suva City Council and this 
<br/>amendment slaps the lessee right on their face. Now, my final concern, this would encourage more 
<br/>informal settlements, they would move in to the State land and find loopholes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Again, Sir, a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member, as a lawyer, should know that the amendments says that any land 
<br/>occupied prior to the enactment of this amendment, prior and not going forward, not prospective 
<br/>but only prior to the enactment. Please, as a lawyer do not mislead the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  I  cannot  find  the  word 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“prior” and I will continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  people  need  affordable  housing  which  you  were  supposed  to  provide  ages  ago.  The 
<br/>provision of affordable housing should be a key priority to any government and I have not seen 
<br/>affordable housing concept by the Housing Authority, it does not work. We saw their priority for 
<br/>the failed Fiji International Golf tournament over the much needed housing of our people.  I know 
<br/>that because I was part of the deal when we were at Fiji TV.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we know, that you have the numbers in the House and you would pass this law, but 
<br/>please take in to account our concerns because obviously, it has been rushed and the stakeholders’ 
<br/>concerns  have  not  been  addressed.  Now,  I  have  mentioned  before  the  plight  of  the  Solomon 
<br/>Islanders and many are  still residing on the land that do not  belong to  them  but  they have been 
<br/>residing on land based on the arrangement done before the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> in gratitude of their 
<br/>hard work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They came 157 years ago, these were the people that came as slaves to build Suva. They 
<br/>were brought in as slaves. SODELPA will set up a commission of inquiry and I pray that this Bill 
<br/>that you brought in would not affect them. We will ensure that they would be given proper legal

<div><span>1343 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tenants.  Now  the  answer  to  this  Government  and  the  incoming  SODELPA  Government,  build 
<br/>affordable squatter tenant properties.   This is the way forward for our children, our nation,… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Keep on reading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I do not read because I own property.  This law, like all other laws, 
<br/>need to be thoroughly consulted Fijiwide.  This is land.  Nations go to war or people go to court 
<br/>because of land issues.  I know it is the State land.  The government comes and the government 
<br/>goes, do it properly and have a thorough consultation.  That is all we are asking.  Because we are 
<br/>now in the elections year, in your haste to provide affordable housing to our people, you bring in a 
<br/>law that will have legal implications down the line.  Mr. Speaker, I do not support this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you know there is a time limit on this agenda item.  
<br/>I would have thought that you would have worked out  your speaking time accordingly.  Do not 
<br/>carry on as if it is an unending debate.  I give licence for time as well, but do not push your luck too 
<br/>far.  Keep it to the essence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully  support  the  motion  before 
<br/></span><span>Parliament.  The motion is Bill No. 26 of 2022, State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022.  We are talking 
<br/></span><span>about 4 percent of land in Fiji, and the amendment that we are talking about here, may be 0.011 
<br/>percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 91 percent of lands in Fiji are </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land that has not been touched, so 
<br/>do not bring this idea about </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, that has not been touched, please.  We are young people 
<br/>here in Parliament, do not confuse them without thinking.  The other land is a Freehold land, so we 
<br/>are talking about the State land.  I want to start with the health perspective, and I want to come back 
<br/>and address the debate on some of the issues that have been brought from the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill allows the repossession of the lease if it has contravened the lease agreement with 
<br/>regards to informal sublease or informal arrangements, which is confirmed by the Committee.  The 
<br/>Committee needs to confirm that this has not been met, the purposes of the lease on State land. It 
<br/>keeps the State lessee honest and strengthens the landlord or the State’s ability and capability to 
<br/>monitor the lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill will also help the landowner and the State to help provide surety to the informal 
<br/>settlers  who  settled  there  because  of  their  arrangement  with  the  formal  lessee,  with  the  original 
<br/>lessee and ensuring that the land can then be developed for their surety, so that they can have surety, 
<br/>they can be able to build, they will have title that can be developed, they can build a house that can 
<br/>withstand a cyclone, they can have water and they can have proper sanitation.   I have talked about 
<br/>it  in  this  Parliament,  several  times  how  the  social  determinants  of  health  help  in  health,  how 
<br/>important  it  is  to  have  a  good  house,  how  important  it  is  to  have  proper  water,  sanitation  and 
<br/>hygiene, all of these contribute.  This is what this amendment is helping to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment will help in the development of the community in that 
<br/>area and the neighbourhood, it will also raise the value of the State land, raise the value of the titles 
<br/>and also raise the value of the State land.  But more importantly, it will provide surety for those 
<br/>people who may be, do not know that was the right way to do it, who are staying on that land.  We 
<br/>have heard this morning how the honourable Minister for Forestry had talked about how this will 
<br/>be very helpful in the Nadi area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that some people had sold land and at the end of the day, it has been done as a 
<br/>scam, or sold a lease.  This is to help these people - whether it comes through Standing Order 51 or 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 55, at the end of the day the people are suffering.  They need us to be able to support 
<br/>them to get surety, Mr. Speaker, Sir, go back again to what I had talked about earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday when the honourable Attorney-General brought this Bill through Standing Order 
<br/>51, I was quite amazed with the debate that came from the other side.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is now 
<br/>nearly four years of our existence in this Parliament, I cannot believe that throughout these four 
<br/>years the same rhetoric still comes from the other side.  The rhetoric about “Every land whether it 
<br/>is freehold or State has to go back” or “We have to find the original landowners.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had said in this august Parliament before that if some of those things they 
<br/>are saying from the other side could be done, it would have been done by the Colonial Government.  
<br/>It would have been done by the late Ratu Mara, it would have been done when the Leader of PAP 
<br/>was Prime Minister, it would had been done by Mr. Qarase.  It would had been done by them.  They 
<br/>did not because legally they cannot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I think we have to remember that we must move forward and this is the way in which 
<br/>we could  move forward.  You are talking  about  the four percent  which is  State land but  the 91 
<br/>percent, not the land in Moala where I come from, that is still sure.  We talk about the four percent 
<br/></span><span>State land.  Who are the landlords of the State land?  The State is the owner of the State land.  I 
<br/></span><span>thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I start my intervention on 
<br/>this Bill, may I just take this opportunity to wish all our nurses a Happy International Nurses Day 
<br/>today. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say unequivocally that the National Federation Party supports 
<br/>the amendment to this Bill, but we hope that the Committee that has been established under the 
<br/>amendment to this Act is going to do its work properly because they will need to do a lot of hard 
<br/>work to make sure that they are fair and perceived to be equal to everyone.  So, let me make that 
<br/>statement very clear also. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But before I go further into my contribution to this Bill, let me just correct and reply to some 
<br/>of  the  sentiments  that  were  echoed  earlier  by  my  learned  friend  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Fisheries.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  the  honourable  Minister  is  unfortunately  solely  mistaken.    It  is  the 
<br/>people now who are tired of this Government; they are tired of this Government not the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- What people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- The people of Fiji, honourable Prime Minister, are 
<br/>tired of this Government and you know why?  Because this Government is boring.  It is boring, it 
<br/>is boring in every aspect of its governance.  I am saying this Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they are tired of 
<br/>the false promises!  It is the Government, not the Opposition?  They are tired of all the unfulfilled 
<br/>promises.  Well, do not worry Minister, I am going to give you a few examples. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Has anyone really been monitoring how many people 
<br/>follow the procedures of this Parliament?  It has dwindled significantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and you 
<br/>know why, because they are tired of hearing one man talking all the time and telling Fijians how 
<br/>they should behave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1345 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what we are tired of.  So, they are tired of the Opposition and let me correct my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable colleague, they are not tired of us but they are tired of you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me also say one other thing - he also said that farmers were told to vacate their farms 
<br/>and  land  by  the  Opposition  and  I  must  say,  he  should  name  who?    Which  opposition?    Do  not 
<br/>generalise, honourable Minister, because this is the kind of gutter level politics that has destroyed 
<br/>the goodwill between landlords and the tenant in the past and this Government, in its desperation to 
<br/>remain in power … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  …  is  shamelessly  adopting  the  same  lies.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  my  reply  to  honourable  Koroilavesau  and  I  just  want  to  re-assure  him, 
<br/>“Honourable Minister, it is not us.  It is you and your team.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendments to this Bill, let me say, Mr. Speaker, that we support it because the NFP 
<br/>believes that confidence comes out from security and giving people security of tenure to build their 
<br/>lives, their livelihoods and the livelihoods of their families are things that the National Federation 
<br/>Party has always supported historically.  So this is one main reason why we believe that this Bill 
<br/>will be good for the people, particularly those who are immediately in need now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  want  to  take  this  opportunity  also  to  raise  this  point,  that  is,  I  know  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General continues to talk about this Bill not being applicable to people who are in squatter 
<br/>settlements.  But I say, Mr. Speaker, that Government should listen and pay attention also to the 
<br/>needs of people who are illegal settlers and are living in squatter settlements on land that belongs 
<br/>to the State.  It is a different matter.  It is paying attention to those who are settling on a legal lease, 
<br/>but there are also the same Fijian people who are settling on Government land but as illegal tenants.  
<br/>This proposal, this amendment is really taking care of those who have been settling  illegally on 
<br/>what was a legal lease where the land otherwise would have dealt with this in a different way.  What 
<br/>about those people with no provisions, because people are talking about equality, so how about us?      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We are only dealing with that under the status quo, you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is fine.  They should, as much as possible - why 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are they not rushing the same Bills through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We are doing that, we are not rushing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is not being rushed through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- The Government should listen to these people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- We are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Take their plight into concern and then deal with it.

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the National Federation Party has been around the country, like I said, we have 
<br/>been advocate of this.  We have heard from the people who have been talking about this for the last 
<br/>15 years.  What has happened?  Has Government finally restored its sight?  Have you finally found 
<br/>your ears?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR I. WAQAINABETE.-  What used to happen before? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- The Government was here for the last 15 years, why 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  But  I  must  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  because  this  is 
<br/>synonymous with the false promises Government gives all the time and it is trying to please the 
<br/>people.  Obviously, it should have done it 15 years ago.  Honourable Bala went up to Sakoca in 
<br/>2014, they are still waiting for him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And he has done absolutely nothing about it.  So, let me say, our people, particularly those 
<br/>who  are  marginalised  and  are  unfortunate  in  our  society  deserve  to  be  given  proper  tenure  and 
<br/>security.  That is why we are supporting this Bill, the National Federation Party supports it and let 
<br/>me reiterate, this Government is bored and they need to go.             
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a point of clarification with respect to comments 
<br/>made by honourable Waqanika - true to its form they always read one part of the paragraph and 
<br/>they do not read the other.  I think she referred to Paragraph 1.3 of the Explanatory Note in the State 
<br/>Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 where it says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In some instances however, occupants of the land have, as a result of dispossession of 
<br/>land  or  due  to  political  upheaval  or  cancellation  or  non-renewal  of  their  leases  or 
<br/>licences, resorted to seek refuge on other land, for which they were not lessees under the 
<br/>Act.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It goes on, Mr. Speaker, and I think it is wise that we actually read this out, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The lessees who permitted such persons to use the land in these instances however did 
<br/>not obtain the consent of the Director of lands making the arrangement unlawful under 
<br/>the Act.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be wise to read the whole paragraph, honourable Member, because that is misleading the 
<br/>general public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute to the debate on the Bill before 
<br/>Parliament.  As pointed out by honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, once again, 
<br/>let me just explain that the proposed amendments relate only to State land - not freehold and not 
<br/>iTaukei land.  It is not  wise to bring  about some other argument, honourable Gavoka, but  I just 
<br/>wanted to re-emphasise that point most of the time as there seems to be some selective hearing and 
<br/>misrepresentation made by the Opposition Members. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1347 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the State Lands Act was actually enacted in 1945.  Past Governments, and 
<br/>I say this quite loudly, Sir, past Governments did not have the vision and drive to solve the evolving 
<br/>issue surrounding State land ownership.  It is this Government that is now addressing the pertinent 
<br/>land issues that have been affecting our people residing on State land for decades. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, political upheavals, particularly the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>, coupled with the expiry of 
<br/>30-year ALTA leases, have contributed immensely to the displacement and dispossession of Fijians 
<br/>from the land they were residing in and earning their livelihoods.  This has left many with no sense 
<br/>of ownership, Sir, and they have not been able to use their land as a form of collateral to obtain bank 
<br/>loans for the construction of their homes, for example.  Due to those problems, occupants have not 
<br/>been able to secure their own individual leases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2013  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  reaffirms  the  Fijian  Government’s 
<br/>commitment and the vision of our honourable Prime Minister of not leaving any Fijian behind, and 
<br/>to ensure that every Fijian has a right to shelter, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are creating an enabling environment through the amendments of the 
<br/>State Lands Act to empower the Director of Lands to re-enter the land and cancel the lease, only 
<br/></span><span>after it has been determined that the lessee had contravened the conditions of the lease.  This will 
<br/></span><span>only happen if there was no consent obtained from the Director of Lands and subsequently, selling 
<br/>off or allowing occupants to settle on the land.  By empowering the Director of Lands and allowing 
<br/>the occupants who have been victims of the head lessee’s laxity in obtaining consent on behalf of 
<br/>the occupants, we are actually ensuring the livelihood of the occupants and their beneficiaries, so 
<br/>that they are secured over the long term by providing a sense of security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  past,  no  Government  has  even  thought  about  the  plight  of  the 
<br/>occupants and their extended families who have been living under a cloud of uncertainty all of these 
<br/>years and have been struggling to secure ownership.  This Government has now given them hope, 
<br/>Sir, for a better tomorrow through the support of the mainstream financial system, which enables 
<br/>them to access grants in relation to land surveying and First Home Owners grants, et cetera.  There 
<br/>are so much more attached to this amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Government has worked smart in ensuring that everything falls into place 
<br/>for our people in terms of having an enabling legislation and access to finance and much more, with 
<br/>the ultimate aim of making the lives of Fijians easier.   Sir, many of the occupants who have actually 
<br/>been living illegally on State land will be regularised through the subdivision process and will be 
<br/>able to proudly own or construct their first homes, and also be able to use it as collateral for future 
<br/>extensions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  confident  that  the  Committee  responsible  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  will  thoroughly 
<br/>investigate, they will take it into account all facts pertaining to the issuance of initial head lease and 
<br/>the subsequent conditions of the lease.  I am also certain of the fact that all affected occupants will 
<br/>be given due consideration by the Committee on a case by case basis which will enable them to 
<br/>provide sound and informed recommendations to the Director of Lands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to echo similar sentiments by the Honourable Attorney-General  
<br/>that the rights of all occupants including the lessee will be protected under these amendments , in 
<br/>fact they have never been more secure accept for under this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to conclude as a Minister responsible for Town and Country Planning 
<br/>also, it gives me great pleasure to see such revolutionary reforms undertaken that unlocks our true 
<br/>potential as we forge Fiji ahead.

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to contribute and I support the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution to Bill No. 26 
<br/>that is before the House.  Let me breakdown the Bill – the Bill deals with the State land and the 
<br/>landlord is the Director of Lands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue that the Bill addresses is that given that some of the lessees cannot be located they 
<br/>cannot subdivide the land but due to other circumstances that are alluded to by the Honourable Koya 
<br/>on  those  that  come  in  to  occupy  the  land  through  the  arrangement  of  the  lessee  resulting  in 
<br/>disposition of land, political upheaval or cancellation or non-renewal of their lease.  So they have a 
<br/>refugee status on that particular portion of land and they have no legal standing.  This particular Bill 
<br/>aims  to  address  and  give  them  a  legal  standing  so  they  can  access  financial  support,  housing 
<br/>assistance plus other community development that they will be left behind without any proper legal 
<br/>standing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  clause  in  the  Bill  amends  section  16,  where  a  Committee  will  be  established  by  a 
<br/>regulation from the current Act and the Committee is just tasked to confirm any contravention by 
<br/>the lessee on the terms and conditions of the lessee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  from  that  the  second  part  of  section  16  which  is  Amendment  No.  6  is  to  allow  and 
<br/>empower  the  Director  of  Lands  to  re-enter  and  regularise  occupants  and  lessees.    This  gives 
<br/>occupants brought in by lessees to gain proper lease and standing and tenancy security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just for the avoidance of doubts I will refer you to Clause 2(8) of the Bill:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For the avoidance of doubt, any occupant of land referred to under this section 
<br/>including the lessee shall remain on the land subject to any terms and conditions on the 
<br/>lease, licence or approval notice of lease granted after the enactment of the State Lands 
<br/>(Amendment) Act 2022.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After we enact this Bill, then the new conditions and terms will apply to the lessee, plus the 
<br/>occupants. So the argument that those that have come in illegally will be displaced that is taken care 
<br/>of in that particular subsection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is just to legalise and regularise the current occupation plus the head lessee and some 
<br/>cannot be located because some of the sales have been done in the last 14 years. This is something 
<br/>that is really good for those that live in this particular area and also their access to things that the 
<br/>community will benefit from and also they cannot access now. I think it also targets our National 
<br/>Development  Plan  (NDP),  plus  the Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDG)  where  no  one  is  left 
<br/>behind.  This particular amendment will allow those in that area, occupants and lessees, to have 
<br/>proper legal standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support this particular Bill given that the issues that are faced by these particular people in 
<br/>these particular areas will be addressed and it will ensure the tenant security of those individuals, 
<br/>lessees plus the occupants in that particular area so that they are able to develop and also benefit 
<br/>from the main financial stream.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the opportunity to speak on Bill No. 26 of 2022 for an Act to amend the State Lands Act of 1945 
<br/>likewise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, your involvement with Vanuabalavu.  I would like to extend also my 
<br/>congratulations to Mere Tuisalalo Naulumatua also known as Mere Samisoni, Dr. Samisoni, thank 
<br/>you very much.  Welcome back for the third time to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in regard to this Bill …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Excuse me!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, address the Chair.  Do not carry on a conversation… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- They are disrespecting your position, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- … with the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Yes, Sir, Bill No. 26 of 2022 has come four years late in regard to 
<br/>this tenure of Parliament.  It should have come in 2018.  This thing here, the honourable Minister, 
<br/>for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport said that there is no other government that has done 
<br/>this.  The Alliance Government took over for 17 years and there was a </span><span>coup</span><span>.  Laisenia Qarase of 
<br/>the </span><span>Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua</span><span> (SDL) met a </span><span>coup</span><span> in December of 2006 so they could not 
<br/>implement and this government has been in power for the last 16 years, this Bill has come 16 years 
<br/>late.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Attorney-General  for  introducing  this  Bill 
<br/>yesterday.  Now Standing Order 51 gives us only 24 hours to discuss the Bill, saying that there is a 
<br/>committee up there and we were kind of surprised that the chairman is the Permanent Secretary for 
<br/>the Ministry of Housing and Community Development which falls under the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General’s  portfolio  as  Minister  for  Housing  and  Community  Development  and  his  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary will be heading, even though this is land,  and should have come under the permanent 
<br/>secretary for lands under honourable Jone Usamate’s portfolio but then it has come this way.  That 
<br/>is why most of the things that we are reading are not transparent.  That is why likewise with other 
<br/>Members of the Opposition …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- … you listen so you can learn!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other Members have said that this Bill needs serious consultation because 
<br/>it involves land.  It is not only the land as honourable  Minister says, it involves Naidovi, Navo, 
<br/>Nasau, Solovi, Malolo Transmitter Road and it involves also Nausori area where the Manoca flats 
<br/>and also around Navua which were given to CSR and also FSC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  these  are  State  Freehold  land  and  as  alluded  by  the  Members  of  the  Opposition 
<br/>especially honourable Jale saying that this land has to be reverted.  Once the leases are made, it has 
<br/>to be reverted to the true owner.  This was given on trustee to the State and now that they have 
<br/>breached the agreement, they have done housing, they have done other businesses there and have 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>breached the agreement in which the land was given by the Trustee, by the iTaukei landowners, 
<br/>they have breached the agreement there and they should revert.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This part of the House welcomes the Bill because it benefits the people of Fiji in regard to 
<br/>the rental given a title.  We support that but in the manner that it has come to this House of Standing 
<br/>Order 51 and not detailing the very basic of it, who is going to be the recipient?  Maybe all these 
<br/>people are going to be the recipient, no one knows because it is not publicly known.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister for Health is the public recipient.  As for Standing Orders 51, soon after this, once the 
<br/>Right of Reply is said by the honourable Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, this law will be passed but then it 
<br/>only took about two hours for us to make it as law.   That is unfair.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I represent the Eastern Division of Fiji from Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau and Rotuma.  These 
<br/>people have no eye here and some of their land are also State land. As you have said over there,  
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, ‘also there are places around Fiji where there are similar situations 
<br/>so the idea is to regularise this’.  Some other places in Fiji, they should know.  We should go around 
<br/>all over Fiji because the iTaukei lands that were given by the iTLTB on the trustee that was given 
<br/>to the State, they must know in the detailed form. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very  soon  you  might  as  well  watch  Bau  Island,  they  might  even  sell  it  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister on the way they are dragging it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just stick to the subject, forget about Bau Island. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 51 is not a joke.  There are other 
<br/>places  that  you  said  honourable  Minister  which  reflect  this  and  this  is  the  same  principle.    The 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar with regards to the settlements of freehold, if this Bill has come here on 
<br/>the State land... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- A Point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  …  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Rasova  has  been 
<br/>meandering about Standing Order 51.  We discussed that yesterday, that is why it was brought up 
<br/>yesterday.  Yesterday’s debate on Standing Order 51 was to discuss Standing Order 51.  Today is 
<br/>about discussing the substantive Bill that is before you and he has been meandering all over the 
<br/>place and you should withdraw that statement that you made that Bau will be sold.  You should 
<br/>stand up and withdraw it.  There are many people in this august Parliament that have Bau geneology 
<br/>and blood within them.  That is very bad of you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, probably I should rephrase it, maybe Bau Landing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Alright, I withdraw that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to the settlements, she has been harping around that they have to do this with the 
<br/>law, they have to give the title and everything.  If this has come into Standing Order 51 yesterday 
<br/>and for us to debate it today and become law today, I think she can do something likewise for the 
<br/>settlements in Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution to the Bill 26 of 2022.  I do not support 
<br/>the Bill in this current form. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1351 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion for an Act to amend the 
<br/>State  Lands  Act  1945  which  was  tabled  yesterday  afternoon  to  this  august  Parliament  by  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think most of the Opposition Members do not understand about the State 
<br/>land, Freehold land and iTaukei land.  I think the two honourable Members who understand are not 
<br/>in  the Parliament;  honourable Mitieli  Bulanauca and honourable Ratu  Naiqama  Lalabalavu who 
<br/>have been former Ministers for Lands and they are absent now from this Parliament.  The person 
<br/>who understands about this Bill is honourable Bulitavu who knows what this Bill is all about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is necessary to amend this Act, to allow for the informal settlements 
<br/>within the State land to be regularised and to stop illegal activities in the State land in future.  It has 
<br/>been from decades that some of the agriculture lessees have sold their residential lots to individual 
<br/>families  from  their  lease  by  way  of  sale  and  purchase  agreement  without  the  consent  from  the 
<br/>Director of Lands and this sale and purchase has been endorsed by the lawyers.  The residential lots 
<br/>are sold without being surveyed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also come across that in some cases, there has been more than 
<br/></span><span>one lessee to a lease and these lessees share the land for farming.  One of the lessee sells or gives 
<br/></span><span>residential lots to their family member or to an outsider from his or her share of farming portion.  
<br/>When one of the lessee dies then the problem emerge where the surviving lessee or the beneficiary 
<br/>of  the  deceased  demands  for  more  money  or  give  eviction  notice  to  those  lessees.  Thus,  those 
<br/>informal settlers has no choice but to run around knocking the Department of Land’s doors and 
<br/>other avenues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  many  cases  of  this  nature  where  we  have  seen  that  the  poor 
<br/>families are struggling to get a proper lease just because they purchase the land in an illegal manner, 
<br/>not known to them.  This Bill will give those families a sign of relief as they can get a surveyed lot 
<br/>with a registered of 99 years residential lease which will enable them to mortgage their lease, to 
<br/>build a decent house which I think honourable Gavoka do not want those people to have a decent 
<br/>house.  This will ease social problem and families can have decent housing with proper sanitation, 
<br/>road and drains, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  will  refrain  the  Agriculture  lessees  from  breaching  the  lease 
<br/>conditions and will keep their land in good husbandry manner. If the lessee want to subdivide a 
<br/>residential or commercial lots from their agriculture holding then they have to follow the proposed 
<br/>State Lands Act or else they will know the consequences on breach of lease conditions as their lease 
<br/>can be re-entered.  This will be a way forward for proper subdivision in future and existing informal 
<br/>settlement will regularise in State land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I really appreciate and wholeheartedly support the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General for this amendment of State Lands Act 1945 which he brought about. I humbly request all 
<br/>honourable Members of this august Parliament to fully support this Bill.  As honourable Tikoduadua 
<br/>has been saying, how can this nation trust a leader like honourable Professor Prasad who ran away 
<br/>from a Talkback Show?  Do we need a leader like honourable Professor Prasad, who ran away from 
<br/>a Talkback Show…

<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also thank the honourable Attorney-General for

<br/>questions come to mind, firstly, how did this land parcels were acquired by the State; and secondly, 
<br/>what were the original purpose of this acquisition?

<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, we support development on the land and the security of tenure 
<br/>but wider consultation should be done, especially with the customary landowners.  Land acquisition 
<br/>in Fiji is governed under the State Acquisition of Lands Act 1940, under the Act or types of land 
<br/>can be acquired for public purposes. This is what the State Acquisition of Lands Act 1940 said in 
<br/>Section 3 ‘power to acquire land’, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1)  Subject  to  other  provisions  of  this  Act,  an  acquiring  authority  may  acquire  lands 
<br/></span><span>required for any public purpose, paying such consideration or compensation as may 
<br/>be agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (2)  An  acquisition  under  this  section  must  not  proceed  unless  the  necessity  for  the 
<br/>acquisition  is  such  as  to  provide  reasonable  justification  for  the  causing  of  any 
<br/>resultant hardship to a person having an interest in the lands.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the lands mentioned by  the honorable  Attorney-General  in  his 
<br/>motion were acquired with the purpose of planting sugarcane through the Colonial Sugar Refining 
<br/>Company  (CSR).  According  to  the  honorable  Attorney-General’s  submission  yesterday,  he 
<br/>mentioned, and I quote from Page 1322 of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We will be able to get proper subdivisions done and Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, 
<br/>these people will get certainty. They can then go to banks, mortgage their leases and 
<br/>build concrete homes and of course that creates a lot more economic activity, so that is 
<br/>what this Act seeks to do.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, clearly, we may have deviated from the original purpose of acquiring these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>land parcels. Section 8 of the Crown Lands Act (Cap 132) provides, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When  any  native  land  which  has  been  acquired  by  the  Crown  for  public 
<br/>purposes  under  the  provisions  of  the  Crown  Acquisition  of  Lands  Act  or  any  other 
<br/>written law is no longer required for such purposes, the Minister, after consultation with 
<br/>the Cabinet, may, by order, declare such land to  be native land and such declaration 
<br/>shall be recorded in the name of the unit from which it was acquired in the Register of 
<br/>Native Lands kept under the provisions of section 8 of the Native Lands Act.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the </span><span>Yavusa e tolu o Navatulevu</span><span> of the </span><span>Vanua o Nadi </span><span>and other 
<br/>landowners  around  Fiji  whose  land  have  been  acquired  for  public  purpose  and  are  currently 
<br/>considered as taken. We call on the Government and the Committee that would look after these 
<br/>lands to also please consider reverting these land parcels to the original landowners.

<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1353 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we support the development of this State land but do it properly in consultation with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to 
<br/>contribute to the motion before the House this morning. We all understand that the land in Fiji is 
<br/>categorised in three categories.  Freehold which is privately owned, the native iTaukei land owned 
<br/>by the landowning unit and the State land that is owned by the Government. We all understand that 
<br/>there  are  about  18,000  leases  in  the  State  land  and  about  four  percent  of  the  land  is  State  land 
<br/>administered by the Department of Land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, all foreshore land below the main watermark, soil under Fiji waters and banks 
<br/>of navigable rivers and streams are State land. The State land are not sold out but some are available 
<br/>on leasehold basis. The State leases are granted and managed by the Department of Lands.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we are concerned  that such far-reaching piece of legislation are brought into the House 
<br/>under the Standing Orders 51, as previously alluded to by the previous speaker of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we support the development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an access to the land, but the process 
<br/>must be followed in a proper manner. The consultations amongst the relevant stakeholders should 
<br/></span><span>always be paramount when sensitive issues such as land is the subject of discussion, particularly in 
<br/></span><span>making an amendment that would affect relevant stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to show my disappointment, not only my disappointment but of the 
<br/>Macuata  Provincial  Council  or  the  Macuata  Holdings,  on  the  process  in  the  manner  how  they 
<br/>rejected the Macuata Holding development lease, which is also  called, Nayaca Subdivision, where 
<br/>now the Fiji National University is located.  We were not consulted and they revoked the lease.  
<br/>There was a development lease and the subdivision was started.  We have $600,000 debt for that 
<br/>development, the Nayaca lease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we built the Macuata House, we went to the bank, the Fiji Development Bank gave a 
<br/>condition, “Only if you include Nayaca debt of $600,000 into the package, then we will approve 
<br/>the loan,” which we built the Macuata House with.  Therefore, I show my disappointment that the 
<br/>Government should have come to the Macuata Provincial and consult us regarding this lease.  We 
<br/>were very  disappointed  when we came to know  that our development  lease was being  revoked, 
<br/>rejected and given to other stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to correct what I said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>earlier… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry on a conversation between you two.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU.- He is only talking to me, I am not taking to him, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  support  the  development,  but  the  processes  must  be  undertaken  and  we  do  not  find 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ourselves in any situation to encounter the problem in future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span> </span><span>I stand corrected, there is one more speaker before the right of reply.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly, I do support the Bill, 
<br/>for four obvious reasons.  Let me just correct the honourable Ratu Tevita Navurelevu.  As far as his 
<br/>disappointment, the proper process was done for the return of Nayaca Subdivision to FNU.  He was 
<br/>in the Provincial Office during that time.  The then </span><span>Turaga na Tui Macuata</span><span>, Ratu Aisea  Katonivere, 
<br/>together  with  the  </span><span>Roko  Tui</span><span>  were  consulted  and  they  gave  their  approval.    In  fact,  it  was  under 
<br/>Macuata Provincial Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but there was no development taking place for so 
<br/>many years.  As a result, the then Minister for Lands, Netani Sukunaivalu, came to the Northern 
<br/>Division, there was a consultation and the then Tui Macuata and the then Roko Tui Macuata, gave 
<br/>their permission for that land, because they were not doing anything on it to be returned, so that 
<br/>FNU can go ahead with the development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that I support this Bill for four obvious reasons.  I leave the 
<br/>legality aspects of it to the honourable Minister for Economy and the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>because I am not a lawyer.  But, it is logic and common sense that leads me to support this Bill.  
<br/>Firstly, it is out of empathy, not sympathy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We leaders must be concerned about what difficulties our people face.  These are ordinary 
<br/>Fijian citizens, suffering as a result of an archaic work.  Secondly, they are our own people and 
<br/></span><span>communities  and  most  of  them  are  farming  communities.    Out  of  empathy,  I  support  this  Bill.  
<br/></span><span>Thirdly, out of necessity.  It is a necessity.  We need to regularise this and we need to legalise it.  
<br/>Of course, it was not done in the proper way, but it is going to take ages again if we have to go as 
<br/>suggested by honourable Jale.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is out of necessity that we need to do this - out of 51, Government is 
<br/>always pragmatic. We see that there is a problem, what is the solution?  Let us fix it.  This is what 
<br/>this Government is doing, fixing it rather than delaying it.  It should have been done ages ago, but 
<br/>it was not done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why it is about timing - they are always concerned about Elections! 
<br/>Elections! Because that is what politicians do, this is leadership.  This is true leadership.  There is a 
<br/>difference  between  politics  and  leadership.    What  we  need  in  this  country  is  true  leadership  in 
<br/>politics and that is what this is.  It is out of necessity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three  -  economic  benefits.    We  talk  about  diversifying  the  economy,  there  is  a  lot  of 
<br/>unutilised land in Fiji that cannot be fully utilised because of this law.  This is the same thing with 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it was expiring from 1997, people had the money, they can 
<br/>invest,  but  they  are  holding  on  to  that  investment  because  this  is  not  there.    They  cannot  do  it, 
<br/>because no one in his right state of mind would invest if there is no security of tenure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is logic and common-sense that we need to fix this.  
<br/>Economic benefits - the farmers are waiting, people will build better homes that is another industry 
<br/>that will benefit from this and with homes, as Minister responsible for disaster management, look 
<br/>at the data from previous disasters.  These are the people that have their houses destroyed after every 
<br/>disaster.  Why?  Because they do not want to put the investment.  This will address resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  shifted  our  development  paradigm,  not  only  development  for  the  sake  of 
<br/>development but resilience must be at the core of development.  Sustainability must be at the core 
<br/>of development and addressing humanitarian principles.  This is about human beings, this is about 
<br/>people.  And we need to address resilience because more into resilience now means lesser expense 
<br/>into the future.  This is an investment Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1355 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who  have  spoken  in  favour  of  the  Bill.    I  have  to  unfortunately,  respond  to  some  of  the  fairly 
<br/>mundane issues that have been raised by some of the Members on the floor but also some of the 
<br/>very misleading statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to start off with honourable Waqanika, very slowly read 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Amendment Act, if you will see Clause 2(4) says and I quote,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law or term or condition 
<br/>of  a  lease,  licence  or  approval  notice  of  lease,  the  Director  of  Lands  may,  where  an 
<br/>arrangement or agreement has been made by a lessee in contravention of this section prior 
<br/>to the enactment of the State Lands (Amendment) Act 2022, re-enter the land and cancel 
<br/>the lease …..” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She said she cannot see “prior to the enactment” so I am just pointing it out to her and I am 
<br/>glad that she is now agreeing by nodding her head, that she has now seen the “prior to the enactment” 
<br/>again.  So, it does not open the doors as she was trying to imply and indeed scare everyone else in 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to make is that I will start off by some of 
<br/></span><span>the  issues  she  has  also  raised  and  honourable  Tikoduadua,  where  they  talked  about  the  squatter 
<br/>developments  and  why  have  they  not  taken  place  and  they  seem  to  misunderstand  this.    As 
<br/>highlighted by the honourable Prime Minister, honourable  Minister for  Defence  and honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands and other that this particular amendment relates to where someone actually has 
<br/>a lease or had a lease and during the term of the lease decided to allocate lots of that land or parcels 
<br/>of that land within the parcel of lease they had to other people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes they gave it to them for a fee or as the honourable Kirpal says, that they may 
<br/>ended into selling purchase agreement.  The lawyers of course were also at fault and they should 
<br/>not have facilitated that.  They should know that the person should have got a consent but of course 
<br/>as we know a lot of lawyers did not follow the law and so they entered into those arrangements.  In 
<br/>other arrangements, you could have someone’s uncle who said, “Look, you have just been booted 
<br/>out because of 1987 from Ba, you can come and build your house here in this corner of my lot and 
<br/>you can stay on.”  The uncle is now dead, the son or daughter is there, and their son or daughter is 
<br/>there and this person’s son or daughter has now occupied the land.  No one has proper tenure.  In 
<br/>some cases the people have migrated, they have disappeared, they cannot be found.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what we need to understand, that is what this law pertains to.  What 
<br/>they were talking about are squatters where there is Crown Land, like Navakai.  Honourable Ratu 
<br/>Lalabalavu hit the nail on the head and honourable Kirpal made a very acute observation that both 
<br/>the former Minister for Lands are not here, I do not know whether it is by choice or they deliberately 
<br/>did that or for some reason or the other because they know what we are talking about, what we are 
<br/>trying to address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The squatter issue, Sir, is where there is no lease, this is simply iTaukei land or Crown land 
<br/>in this case, State land is there and people have just come and built and no one stops them.  One of 
<br/>the reasons, Sir, for example, why the Director of Lands post-1987 did not do anything about it, 
<br/>because  they  knew  that  many  people  have  become  what  we  call  “IDPs”  –  Internally  Displaced 
<br/>Person.  They had nowhere else to go.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka, honourable Tuisawau nor honourable Saukuru does not talk about that.  
<br/>There  are  IDPs  in  this  country  who  have  nowhere  to  go.    When  leases,  for  example,  were  not 
<br/>renewed  in  Vanua  Levu,  (honourable  Prof.  Prasad  you  should  know  this),  they  all  ended  up  as

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>squatters.    They  do  not  talk  about  that.    Honourable  Jale  so  flippantly,  as  a  former  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary who I thought would have a bit more empathy said, “Boot them all out.”  We said, “Where 
<br/>will they go?”  He said, “Oh, deal with it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very bad, very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Naulumatua talked about empathy and love, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where is that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Missing from that side of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- And they talk about the goodwill of the landowners, yes, 
<br/>they have leased the land, they have also made money from that land when they leased the land.  
<br/>These people have got nowhere to go.  No one talks about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today in New Zealand, 5.6 percent of the land is Native titled.  In Australia after Mabo, 32 
<br/>percent became Native titled and most of it is the internal desert area of Australia.  Fiji is one of the 
<br/>settler countries where 91 percent of all the land is native titled.  This Prime Minister actually did 
<br/></span><span>something proactive about it - they all talked about it, all of the former Prime Ministers talked about 
<br/></span><span>it, - he said, “we will do subdivision of iTaukei land.  Make them asset and cash rich also.  We are 
<br/>the only Government that has done that.  The leader of PAP and Mr. Qarase converted iTaukei land 
<br/>to Freehold land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- When we pointed that out, they said it was the law that 
<br/>allowed it, so let us do it.  This is also the law.  They are now questioning State land.  Let me read 
<br/>you a quote, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Deed of Cession, this is where it comes from: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That the absolute proprietorship of all lands, not shown to be now alienated so 
<br/>as to become bona fide the property of Europeans or other foreigners (in other words 
<br/>Freehold land) or not now in the actual use or occupation of some chief or tribe, or not 
<br/>actually required for the probable future support and maintenance of some chief or tribe 
<br/>shall  be  and  is  hereby  declared  to  be  vested  in  Her  Said  Majesty  her  heirs  and 
<br/>successors.”           
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was signed by all the chiefs except, of course, there was only chief from the western 
<br/>division, all the others were from the Eastern and Southern Divisions.  That formed the basis of land 
<br/>tenureship in Fiji and that was subsequently passed onto the 1970 Constitution, 1990 Constitution, 
<br/>1997  Constitution  and  the  2013  Constitution.  That  was  the  basis  of  this.  I  know  honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau is going to do some fancy footwork tomorrow on this, but we will take him on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  a  case  also,  Ratu  Epeli  Kanakana  case  where  he  challenged  the  freehold 
<br/>conversion of the Suva Peninsula and we all know what happens to the Suva peninsula - Ratu Seru 
<br/>Cakobau gave it away as compensation to some American ship owners because someone set fire to 
<br/>one of the ships.  He said, “You can have this, I am the Tui Viti, you can have this land.”  That is 
<br/>how it became Freehold land.  If you go to Bua, Savusavu, those lands were actually given away.  
<br/>Of course, some of the people converted iTaukei land to Freehold land for a few muskets – it did 
<br/>happen.    But,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  judgment  in  this  Court  holds  that  the  tenure,  through 
<br/>constitutional means, still holds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1357 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It does not mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at Independence in 1970, 81 percent to 83 percent of all 
<br/>the land in Fiji was iTaukei land, what we call ‘Native title’.  Today, it is 91 percent.  Schedule A 
<br/>and Schedule B land have gone back to the landowners.  Some of them are extinct </span><span>mataqali</span><span> – those 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> do not exist.  There is a trust fund there also, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Some of those moneys 
<br/>have been put to good use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, today, 91 percent of all the iTaukei land have Native title.  The question that needs 
<br/>to be asked is, “What is happening with those lands?”  Every single town in Fiji, except for Suva 
<br/>and Ba, are all on iTaukei land – Navua, Sigatoka, Nadi, Lautoka, Tavua, Rakiraki – all iTaukei 
<br/>land.  They are getting lease moneys from that, they do not talk about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They do not talk about the fact that nearly 99 percent of all the hotels in Fiji are built on 
<br/>iTaukei land.  They get lease moneys from there.  Some of them are sharing the profits.  Of course, 
<br/>some of those lease conditions should have been a lot better.  When did it happen?  In the 1970s, 
<br/>1980s, 1990s but not when this Government was around.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why you need to 
<br/>come to this Parliament with facts and intellectual honesty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought common sense will prevail but as we have expected, they want 
<br/></span><span>to  turn this  into  an ‘iTaukei  versus other  people’ issue.  They know, honourable Saukuru.  You 
<br/></span><span>know very well that Schedule A and Schedule B have been returned.  All of the land that are under 
<br/>State land, there is no dispute, there is no claim being made…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Attorney-General  is  misleading  Parliament.    I  was  talking  about  State 
<br/>acquisition of land.  Native land were taken in for the purpose of the State.  When they deviate from 
<br/>that, it should be returned to the original landowners, and that is what the law says. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I will come back to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact is, Schedule A and Schedule B land have been returned.  All State 
<br/>land that the Director of Lands actually deals with, there is no claim on it.  There is no encumbrance 
<br/>on it from any Native title owner, that is why it is State land.  There is no dispute about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are now trying to say that there is a dispute about it.  Coming to Parliament, standing 
<br/>here and saying, “On behalf of this landowning unit, I am making the submission”, no submission 
<br/>has been made.  No claim has been made against the Director of Lands in the past 40, 50, 80 or 100 
<br/>years.  The ones that had to be returned have been returned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect of land that have been acquired for public purpose, that is a separate issue.  Public 
<br/>purpose means where the public actually uses it, where there is a road, a reservoir, an airport, a 
<br/>hospital so that is what it relates to.  There is no public road there, there is no airport, there is no 
<br/>hospital there, there is no reservoir there, he knows that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General should not be lying in Parliament.  Then why have they 
<br/>not returned the land on which the Lautoka Water Catchment to the original landowners, when it 
<br/>has served its purpose.  The Vaturu Dam is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Vaturu Dam is on iTaukei land, it is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State land.  We are not talking about Vaturu Dam.

<br/>sold  it.  We are trying to regularise that.  They  are bringing everything  else into it.  That  is the 
<br/>difference it is.  They know about Lovu Seaside. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point is, people like honourable Saukuru, coming from Vitogo… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- A Point of Order, Sir. Lovu Seaside is native land.  Please do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mislead Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, Honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  let  me  finish  the  sentence.  My  point  is  that  Lovu 
<br/>Seaside of course we all know is native title.   My question to you, to him and to all those people, 
<br/></span><span>what are they doing about the development of it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now going to pay them the market rental rates where we have taken out development 
<br/>leases over it to develop it to proper roads. What they are doing is </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangements. They 
<br/>are not realising the full value of the iTaukei land that was my point.  You will see he is now looking 
<br/>the other way, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make is this.  One of the issues 
<br/>that had been raised by Honourable Rasova he talked about Permanent Secretary for Housing.  If 
<br/>the Director of Lands is the one who is going to be issuing the cancellation and re-entry of the land, 
<br/>et cetera then obviously he needs to have an independent committee and obviously it is to do with 
<br/>housing  because  otherwise  even  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Lands  is  in  the  Committee  itself.  
<br/>Again you are trying to create there is some kind of underhanded dealing going on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  wanted  to  make  was  about  Honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua talked about Government is boring.  I mean I did not know we are supposed to have 
<br/>disco lights and we all fancy and dancing and have shining neon lights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian public do not want lights and glamor. They 
<br/>want actual attraction on the ground.  They want free education.  They want subsidised electricity. 
<br/>They want water.  They want roads, bridges and jetties. His leader, you know the other day, went 
<br/>on about, ‘Oh, Walesi $10 million, they are forcing television stations to join them’, why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MaiTV</span><span> cannot even pay its licences. We have allowed them a repayment system.  Do you 
<br/>think a television company that cannot pay its licence fees will have the ability to set up its own 
<br/>infrastructure tower in  Lau, Rotuma and inland of Viti Levu? Have they bothered to understand 
<br/>what </span><span>Walesi</span><span> is about?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Walesi</span><span> is about setting up infrastructure so everyone and every TV company can access and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have their programmes aired everywhere in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Exciting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1359 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Noimalu  in  the  interior  of  Naitasiri.  
<br/>Honourable  Prime  Minister  will  know  on  the  horseback,  those  people  are  now  getting  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>
<br/>television. They are watching what you are saying in Parliament, Lau, Rotuma all of those places, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    These  television  companies  have  no  upfront  capital  expenditure,  no  upfront 
<br/>capital infrastructure cost. They focus on programming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, they come here and try and obfuscate issues.   In the same 
<br/>way honourable Professor Prasad and all of the others went on about and I said this before and I 
<br/>will say it again about honourable Prime Minister going overseas, myself going overseas.  He went 
<br/>for medical treatment in New Zealand. Mr. Rabuka went for medical treatment overseas and when 
<br/>he is being replaced that has been done, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. The problem with this man 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General, Mr. Speaker, is that he keeps lying.  I wished the Honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister well. I have never said why he went overseas for medical treatment, never. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You said it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Never said that.  All I said was ….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Check the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-… be transparent  about the Honourable Prime Minister of 
<br/>this country.  He is the Prime Minister.  That is what I said.  I never question his treatment overseas. 
<br/>Do not lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did say it and they said it outside 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this kind of hypocrisy and small time political point-scoring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that continues not just outside Parliament but inside Parliament, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  point  is  this  that  this  Government  as  Honourable  Seruiratu  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlighted before that we are empathetic, that we look at what people need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way ‘Help for Homes Initiative’, Mr. Speaker, Sir where we put $125 million 
<br/>to help people rebuild their homes ($110 million).  We react to what people and the society need. 
<br/>In the same way with the two rounds of the $360, two rounds of $50, one round of $90, the $500 
<br/>million injected into the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is that we have a long term prospective on growth.  We provide 
<br/>security. We provide stability.  We provide decisive leadership and that is what this Government is 
<br/>all about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  very  quickly  like  to  mention  of  course  is  that 
<br/>honourable Gavoka talked about you know, let us then we will go and look at it and then we will 
<br/>you know do an assessment.  The supermarkets before Korovuto, they have been now mortgaged 
<br/>to banks.  So suddenly, they want to do precisely what Laisenia Qarase wanted to do, was set up 
<br/>this land claims tribunal.  Provide uncertainty!  It will completely undermine the financial system 
<br/>in Fiji.  Nobody will know exactly what kind of security you have in your tenure even Freehold 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>land will be threatened.  That is what they are proposing.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course yes, that is 
<br/>what you are proposing.  So, suddenly freehold is all right but Crown land is not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- A Point of Order.  Misleading Parliament!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I said there will always be security of tenure, no matter the situation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, please can he stop misleading Parliament please?  Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, security of tenure under what conditions, 
<br/>when you already have a lease, for example, a Crown lease that is deposited and held as a mortgage 
<br/>with the bank and suddenly you are going to now come and say half way through the lease, I am 
<br/>going to change this – that will undermine the financial system.  That is precisely my point.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, getting back to the point to the Bill itself, this particular amendment 
<br/>as highlighted previously is confined to those leases or confined to lands where leases were actually 
<br/>issued.  People who have now residing on those lands, they will now be able to get proper lease.  
<br/></span><span>Prior to them getting a proper lease, the committee and as highlighted also in the amendment too, 
<br/></span><span>there  would  be  various  regulations  that  will  be  built  around,  governing  the  parameters  of  the 
<br/>committee, what they need to do.  We have already had meetings in many of those places, Sir and 
<br/>that is the consultation that has taken place.  Once that is done then the Director of Lands actually 
<br/>can then re-enter.   I am not talking about physically re-entering but from a legal perspective, re-
<br/>enter and then issue proper leases to all these people.  The town and country planning can now come 
<br/>and do the roads, the drains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister for Health highlighted it is actually a sanitary and hygiene issue and 
<br/>then these people will be able to get proper leases, Sir.  And again the point is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>they have said why we have not done it in the past 16 years.  Of course many of these issues we 
<br/>tried to resolve.  Honourable Minister Koya will also tell you, the former Minister for Lands will 
<br/>tell you, honourable Usamate was up in the Nausori Highlands as also on other places where people 
<br/>have sold up, we have tried to resolve these issues.  It is only after we have come against a brick 
<br/>wall, a legal brick wall that we have had to make this amendment otherwise it cannot be done.  So, 
<br/>we have tried and made all attempts to do so, work within the framework but we could not and we 
<br/>had to have this legal amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can tell you, since we proposed this last night and tabled this, I have had 
<br/>so many people texting me messages saying thank you very much, we will now be able to get proper 
<br/>leases and build proper homes.  And Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to tell them that we will work as 
<br/>quickly as possible to be able to ensure that we will be able to offer them proper leases and indeed 
<br/>provide them some security for them.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I thank the Attorney-General  for his  reply.  Honourable Members, the
