<h3>MAIDEN SPEECH – HON. DR. M.T. NAULUMATUA</h3>
<div><span>MAIDEN SPEECH – HON. DR. M.T. NAULUMATUA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M.T. NAULUMATUA.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and dear honourable Members of Parliament; it 
<br/>gives me great pleasure to stand before you all in this august Parliament at this juncture.  It may be 
<br/>six months away from national elections and given the way I have come into this august Parliament, 
<br/>some may say that I am in the middle of a perfect storm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my lifetime of experiences, I have learnt that God in His infinite wisdom, has designed 
<br/>everything for our good and to make us bring Him glory.  It is, therefore, no accident when we find 
<br/>ourselves even under some strange circumstances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>God has a perfect plan and there are no accidents with Him.  The family you were born into 
<br/>was  no  accident.    The  country  you  live  in,  the  language  you  speak,  the  friends  you  make,  your 
<br/>weaknesses,  mistakes  you  have  made  and  poor  decisions  -  none  of  them  are  accidents  to  God.  
<br/>Failures  with  your  spouse  and  children,  things  you  wish  you  had  done  differently  and  painful 
<br/>experiences - none of them are accidents to God. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I come from a lineage of people of the cloth.  My grandparents were </span><span>vakatawas</span><span> and a great 
<br/>great grandfather came all the way from England as a medical doctor, who later became a reverend 
<br/>in Tonga.  For us, the words of God are our guide, as is provided in the Book of Isaiah 46:9-10 that 
<br/>says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“9.  Remember the former things of old: for I am God and there is no other;  
<br/>10.  Declaring  the  end  from  the  beginning,  and  from  ancient  times  things  not  yet 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Jehovah the ever faithful God we serve, knew on this day that I will stand before you all in this 
<br/>august Parliament.

<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. Dr. M.T. Naulumatua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not here to preach but I want us all at this time in Fiji’s history to 
<br/>reflect on the principles that our forefathers lived with, here in Fiji.  Fiji has a dark history with 
<br/>heathenism and cannibalism.    If not for the Christian Missionaries, we would  still be where  we 
<br/>were.    Hence  for  SODELPA,  as  a  political  party,  one  of  the  founding  principles  we  encourage 
<br/>strongly is to have God-fearing, honest and hardworking people to lead this great nation of ours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly, there has been a lot of upheaval in SODELPA lately.  People like me have never lost 
<br/>sight of the bigger picture.  The need to serve our people and improve their livelihoods is a burning 
<br/>desire that drives our days and nights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have come from a struggling background.  My mother went on to prima three only, but she 
<br/>taught my siblings and I, the value hard work and honesty.  When she died, she had $10,000 in her 
<br/>bank account – money she had saved from the little sewing businesses and other entrepreneurial 
<br/>work she used to do.  It was those principles that I learnt to build my business that I founded to be 
<br/>what it is today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hot  Bread  Kitchen  this  year  celebrates  its  40</span><span>th</span><span>  anniversary  and  over  the  years,  we  have 
<br/>employed men and women, who have built families and sent their children to school to become 
<br/></span><span>very useful people of society.  I have over 800 staff currently and for me, we need to be able to 
<br/></span><span>‘walk the talk’ as leaders and when we come before our people in this august Parliament, they can 
<br/>say, “Yes, he or she knows what he or she is talking about.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  leaders  who  enter  into  parliamentary  service  must  be  visionary  men  and 
<br/>women,  who  serve  our  people  inside  and  outside  of  Parliament.    In  2014,  when  the  transition 
<br/>happened  from  Soqosoqo  Duavata  ni  Lewenivanua  (SDL)  to  Social  Democratic  Liberal  Party 
<br/>(SODELPA), I remained one of the founding members of the Party.  At the time of Elections then, 
<br/>apart from the FijiFirst and National Federation Party, other parties that existed in 2006 were no 
<br/>longer around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA, therefore, was one of the handful that had the political guts to 
<br/>re-establish itself, and we did so by collecting the necessary signatures from around the countryside, 
<br/>as required by law.  And for that, I will be forever grateful for the lives of our men and one woman, 
<br/>who gallantly went out and did this task for us, even at the expense of being prosecuted for it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA, true to its nature and intentions to advance the course of the 
<br/>indigenous  Fijian  people  and  to  look  after  everyone,  has  become  a  part  of  this  great  nation  and 
<br/>welcomed all other political parties to come under the umbrella of SODELPA.  We had people from 
<br/>SVT, One FIJI, PDP, FLP, CAMV and others who joined under the SODELPA banner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  when  people  asked  what  happened  in  SODELPA,  why  SODELPA  was  always 
<br/>fighting,  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  because  the  political  ideologies  of  all  these  political  parties  clashed.  
<br/>There was constant power struggle where these other new recruits into the Party tried to </span><span>coup</span><span> the 
<br/>control of SODELPA by ousting honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa from her leadership of the Party in 
<br/>2015.  In fact, they succeeded, as we all know, and took the Party to Elections in 2018 whereby they 
<br/>had by then managed to recruit candidates who would be loyal to their leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people will remember, as a result, all the arguments on the use of Government grant 
<br/>and the many other upheavals in SODELPA where the Constitution of the Party was disregarded.  
<br/>It is because such ‘gang mentality’ had taken sprout in SOLDEPA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ultimately,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  all  know  the  result  of  such  undemocratic  and  conniving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>politics.  Those same people have either left SODELPA to join the newly established Party under
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. Dr. M.T. Naulumatua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the leader that tried to </span><span>coup</span><span> SODELPA, or they will join him soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Time will bear testament, Mr. Speaker, to nasty dirty politics that is not people-centric, but 
<br/>to  focus  on  individual  power  struggles.    It  is  imperative  for  senior  citizens  like  me,  if  there  is 
<br/>anything else I can be of use for in this august Parliament, to point out such evil intentions that our 
<br/>future generations must be weary of and learn from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  those  that  engage  in  such  unprincipled  politics  take  our  people’s  votes  for 
<br/>granted, and they bear no allegiance to our nation and its needs, but their own selfish selves and 
<br/>their kind.  Such people must be denounced for who they are because they are certainly not leaders, 
<br/>as they do not set good examples for our young people to follow.  Instead, they teach our future 
<br/>leaders the art of stealing, of conniving,  of  cronyism  and nepotism.  And there is  no end to  the 
<br/>nasties they create in the wake of their departure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mind you, Mr. Speaker, those traits they will take with them wherever they go, and it is only 
<br/>a matter of time when we will see them squabbling again for positions in the new space they have 
<br/>created for themselves.  Sir, SODELPA and our supporters will be the last one to laugh.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are now at the point where we will very shortly elect our next government. 
<br/></span><span>Our people must ask themselves the following questions; what is it that we want from our political 
<br/>leaders?  What do we expect them to do for us when they enter Parliament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  applied  and  have  been  accepted  to  be  a  provisional  candidate  for 
<br/>SODELPA for this coming General Elections.  I do so because I want to be able to influence policies 
<br/>that are people-centred.  I failed to make the first entry into Parliament in 2014 and again after the 
<br/>2018 General Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I strongly believe that the old brand of politics of race, religion and provincialism led to my 
<br/>voters being robbed of my representation of their interests, and that of our people who entrusted 
<br/>their future into the hands of those they chose to stand for parliamentary service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  now  implore  our  people  to  be  wise.  They  have  now  seen  the  nature  of 
<br/>politicians  we  have.  Some  will  come  around  asking  for  their  votes,  again,  shamelessly.    After 
<br/>disappearing from them following in 2018 I trust people will shun such politicians and likewise 
<br/>refuse to vote for leaders who would desert them before completing their terms in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When politicians do not respect the will of voters and ditch their parties only after two years 
<br/>in Parliament, how can they assure that they will not do the same again after 2022 Elections, just 
<br/>because some leadership struggle does not come their way?  The question to also ask is, did they 
<br/>ask their voters before disserting their posts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have politicians jumping around from party to party.  As someone who has 
<br/>lived life to the full and witnessed a lot of political evolution over time, I look at such people and 
<br/>encourage all whom I know not to support them.  Why?  It is because the motives of such politicians 
<br/>are certainly not based on political ideologies or issues that can make a difference in the lives of our 
<br/>people.  Such politicians follow people they believe will give them a comfortable win without too 
<br/>much struggle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are opportunists that run around chasing an easy life and they will use their money, 
<br/>their charm, and even their professional titles to hoodwink people.  What a shame, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>that in a country that has gone through so much political turmoil like ours, there are still those that 
<br/>are so blinded by greed that they will go to any length to hoodwink innocent struggling citizens.

<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. Dr. M.T. Naulumatua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For me, Mr. Speaker, political parties are like a vessel with a captain.  If a vessel goes down 
<br/>because of bad weather, it must sink with all its crew.  A captain who abandons ship minus his crew 
<br/>is a deserter who must never be trusted again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In maritime tradition, it is said the captain goes down with the ship because a sea captain 
<br/>holds ultimate responsibility for both their ship and everyone embarked on it, and in an emergency, 
<br/>will either save those on board or die trying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In certain countries, captains who abandon their ships are said to have committed a crime.  
<br/>For me, I believe not completing one’s elected political years in Parliament is the ultimate crime, 
<br/>for leaders who have let down the people who entrusted their votes to them.  It is sad for those who 
<br/>dare think that such people who have failed them in 2018 can win again this time.  What new things 
<br/>will they, as leaders, bring to the voters to enable them to win?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Albert Einstein said, and I quote –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>different results.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, leadership is about making a difference in people’s lives.  There is so much 
<br/>that remains to be done.  We have people from three generations still living in squatter settlements 
<br/>like Qauia, Valenicina and Nadonumai, for instance.  They are there by the grace of the landowners 
<br/>of such places, but such impoverished settlements cannot be allowed to exist forever without any 
<br/>genuine attempt to provide them with long-term land security, which can be achieved by way of 
<br/>land titles of ownership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I implore our leaders in this august Parliament to stop the blame game.  
<br/>Our people do not want to listen to the rubbish that comes from this Parliament every time we have 
<br/>a parliamentary sitting.  Hurling accusations against each other without offering solutions to grant 
<br/>relief for our people must stop.  Our youth want jobs and reasonable rent and affordable housing.  
<br/>Our  older  folks  deserve  a  well-resourced  public  hospital,  not  one  where  two  mothers  died  of 
<br/>septicaemia in January and February 2020.  Such deaths in this modern day and age is unacceptable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have had people from all walks of life asking me for assistance, whether for 
<br/>employment or streetlights  like those from  Lami Village, or water tanks from  Naivikinikini and 
<br/>Valenicina,  or  from  Ballantine  Memorial  School  where  I  was  asked  to  repair  teachers’  quarters 
<br/>which had become rundown and was close to closure by the Lami Health Department, or to repair 
<br/>a private room at the CWM Hospital which the honourable Prime Minister then commissioned.  My 
<br/>heart has always been burdened to move and to do what I can to assist communities in need, and I 
<br/>did those with my own money.  I did not have to ask for donors to give me money to carry out those 
<br/>important community projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am well aware that a lot of these developments are business of Government 
<br/>to do, however, we are leaders from the community and we must also walk the talk.  Parliament is 
<br/>not a place to come and make money, or scam money.  In this august Parliament, we must plan and 
<br/>devise national policies that serve all of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty  is  an  across-the-board  issue  that  deprives  people  of  their  basic  human  rights.  
<br/>Whether in Parliament or outside of it, those who have pledged to become servants of the people 
<br/>through this august Parliament must accept that they have the responsibility to provide relief to our 
<br/>people in whatever capacity they can.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. Dr. M.T. Naulumatua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, ask Government to see to it that there is some kind of criteria 
<br/>set for those wishing to stand for politics; that they must have the ability and the resources to conduct 
<br/>some level of national assistance to our people as an enabling criteria for election candidacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  recent  past,  a  political  leader  has  said  that  during  his  time  as  Prime  Minister,  70 
<br/>percent of top civil servants came from his province and that is from his part of the nation.  Now, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA Government  would never allow such discriminatory policies to  be 
<br/>practised.  We will always be fair to our people and ensure an equal representation of all races and 
<br/>people in our various employment sectors.  We owe it to ourselves and our younger people a future 
<br/>that promotes equity and stability, not bias, envy and unnecessary cronyism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  founded  Hot  Bread  Kitchen  40  years  ago  with  the  late  Dr.  Jimione 
<br/>Samisoni, Tiko  Eastgate, Tony Phillips and  bakers Joe Andrea from  Rotuma and the Australian 
<br/>David Bedgood.  Whilst my colleagues have passed on and some have moved on to do other things, 
<br/>I have ensured the business has materialised into 27 shops around Fiji with two more targeted for 
<br/>this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I implore Government to support businesses like ours and encourage them with incentives 
<br/></span><span>to stabilise during this challenging global environment as we try to recover from  the COVID-19 
<br/></span><span>pandemic.  We must encourage domestic market growth, which comes in handy when the global 
<br/>pressures that are unpredictable come down hard on us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Hot Bread Kitchen, we refused to send people home as a result of shop 
<br/>closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the Western Division.  What we decided to 
<br/>do was to get our staff on voluntary reduced hours of those who preferred to go on leave to do so, 
<br/>and resume when things normalised.  Many of them are now back at work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must be human about our leadership role.  We must understand the 
<br/>struggles of our people.  In this election preparation period, we as national leaders must encourage 
<br/>calmness  and  ease.    Each  aspiring  candidate  must  continuously  ask  ourselves,  what  are  our 
<br/>intentions for going into Parliament?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  must  encourage  our  community  leaders  to  get  people  to  vote,  as  it  is  their  civic 
<br/>responsibility.  It is no use complaining about your Government and resources afterwards, if you 
<br/>did not participate in selecting the government of your choice when you had the chance yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For us as a political party, we are happy to have gone through our period of uncertainty.  It 
<br/>allowed those who never shared the aspirations of SODELPA in the first place, and were never true 
<br/>to our party principles to leave us.  It is better for everyone in the long run to separate the sheep 
<br/>from the wolves, so to speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I encourage those who want stable leadership and real change in Fiji to 
<br/>vote SODELPA in the coming Elections.  Our people must be assured that SODELPA is the only 
<br/>party  that  has  never  changed  its  aspirations.    That  is  why  you  will  not  see  us  engaging  in  any 
<br/>coalition without proper thought, for we do not believe that the aspirations of our indigenous people, 
<br/>for instance, should be watered down because it is overtaken by other competing political interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Word of God in Ephesians 4:14 guides us that, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and 
<br/>carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful 
<br/>scheming.”

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be true to the needs of our fellow countrymen and women and those who wish to invest in 
<br/>our Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker,  I will end by encouraging us all to do our best in this august 
<br/>Parliament when  given the opportunity.   For me, these few months  I have been  granted will  be 
<br/>utilised to make meaningful contributions that provide solutions for our nation’s development.  I 
<br/>will want to present for Government’s consideration the importance of allowing businesses to do 
<br/>what  we  do  best  without  much  interference  by  way  of  restrictive  legislation.  Should  there  be 
<br/>legislation necessary, they must be created in consultation with those it will impact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must be the solution, not part of the problem. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you and may God bless Fiji.
