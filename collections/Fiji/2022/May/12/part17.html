<h3>COMMITTEE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF DIRECT INITIATIVESTO FARMERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR</h3>
<div><span>COMMITTEE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF DIRECT INITIATIVES 
<br/>TO FARMERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, this motion is perilous and a waste 
<br/>of parliamentary time.  Let me first make corrections, factual errors made by honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad when he introduced his motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad said that before, the Ministry of Agriculture had veterinary in 
<br/>every district - 12 districts.  The Ministry of Agriculture never had 12 veterinarians.  At the most, 
<br/>at one particular point in time, there were three.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- You said that the Ministry of Agriculture before… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- What have I wronged?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, never ever, the Ministry of Agriculture had 12 
<br/>veterinarians .  Veterinarians are scarce human resource.  For the first time ever, we now have four 
<br/>full time veterinarians with us on our payroll.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  said  that  when  we  were  giving  out  fencing  materials  to 
<br/>livestock farmers, there was a criteria that if they do not plant juncao grass, they would not receive 
<br/>the fencing material.  Absolutely wrong and incorrect!  What we said was that, with the fencing 
<br/>material, we will also provide to them a quarter acre of planting material for juncao grass and we 
<br/>want them to establish that because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during drought season, pasture is an issue.  
<br/>So we want them to establish a pasture which will survive during the drought period, high yielding, 
<br/></span><span>high in protein content and once you plant juncao grass, it is outside the paddock, it is a cut and 
<br/></span><span>carry pasture, it will last there for 40 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad said that we are not doing enough in terms 
<br/>of establishing farm roads.  Over the last three years, we have established 102 kilometres of new 
<br/>farm roads.  Never before this level of farm roads was done.  There are two ways we are doing that, 
<br/>one is the Ministry’s allocation for actual outsourcing of farm road construction that we give out to 
<br/>contractors, they do the farm road and secondly, over the last three years, we have acquired new 
<br/>machinery from development partners.  So, with the machinery, with the fuel budget, we get gravel 
<br/>from that area, doing an Environment Management Plan and we establish farm roads.  That is why 
<br/></span><span>we are able to speed up the establishment of the farm roads.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, we are 
<br/></span><span>looking at about 75 kilometres of farm road established within this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad said that we should go organic.  In the same 
<br/></span><span>breath, he argued that we should provide subsidy for chemicals.  The honourable Member does not 
<br/></span><span>understand about organic agriculture.  Why is he arguing that we must give them chemicals and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1381 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fertilizer and subsidise rate and he is saying that we should take advantage of the organic market.  
<br/>Sir, we are promoting organic agriculture and just this week, I had said that I was in Koro Island.  
<br/>In Koro, they want Koro Island to go organic, follow suit from Rotuma.  Rotuma is now declared 
<br/>organic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very particular about what kind of agriculture model we have in 
<br/>non-sugar agriculture, we do not want to go down the path of the sugar industry.  We have shied 
<br/>away from getting farmers subsidies and buy fertilizers and chemicals based on subsidies.  Everyone 
<br/>knows that when we have subsidies, their optimal resource utilisation will not be done because the 
<br/>prices are not the market price and, therefore, the farmers are not getting the true signal of the input 
<br/>price.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, ask any first  year  economics  student, they will tell  you that farmers or 
<br/>business persons must face the true input and output price to make decisions about what venture to 
<br/>get into because they will be doing long term number crunching for business viability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad said that ginger farmers are getting a price of 
<br/>$1.60, absolutely incorrect!  The exporters are paying $2 to $2.60 per kilogramme, this is the rate 
<br/>paid by different exporters.  In the supermarkets, he should go today and see the label there, ‘ginger 
<br/>price’ it is sold at $2 to $4 per kilogramme (matured ginger). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad spoke about a farmer who approached him 
<br/>in Savusavu and said that he has one tonne of cassava and no one is buying.  Sir, in Savusavu, we 
<br/>have  a  full-time  operational  office  to  collect  the  produce  -  </span><span>dalo</span><span>  and  cassava,  from  farmers  in 
<br/>Savusavu.  For cassava, you cannot collect everyday because you cannot run a freezer up and down 
<br/>every day.  There is are collection days for cassava as follows; Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  
<br/>They must pull it up on Monday morning, we collect at around mid-day, process it, put it in the 
<br/>freezer  truck  and run it  down.  You cannot collect  cassava  everyday.   So, cassava  and  </span><span>dalo</span><span>  are 
<br/>collected from Savusavu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you collect a produce, you need to dispose or sell it out.  How do we 
<br/>know the amount of produce we will be collecting in Savusavu or Wainikoro or Lagalaga, et cetera?  
<br/>We will only know if they sign up a supply contract with us - we would then know what would be 
<br/>the volume, on what particular day and how much are they planting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority of these farmers have not signed up the supply contract.  What they do is, today 
<br/>they need some cash, they will pull out some cassava or </span><span>dalo,</span><span> walk up to Savusavu Office and say, 
<br/></span><span>“I need to sell it now.”  It is not a bank to cash in when you need cash, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We need 
<br/></span><span>to plan, AMA needs to plan.  We have to fulfil market demands.  We need to ensure that we do not 
<br/>take in as much as we get and run into losses, which used to happen before.  That used to be the 
<br/>model before.  No more! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad asked, what is wrong, why are we importing pig meat? We 
<br/>should be producing premium and beef cuts.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, tell him to go and talk to Mr. Rabuka.  
<br/>In 1998, he closed the Yalavou Beef Cattle Scheme, we are now reviving that Scheme.   Sir, millions 
<br/>of dollars of Australian aid money was spent at the Yalavou Beef Scheme.  At the farm, the quarters, 
<br/>streetlights, electricity, water, et cetera, were there but in 1998, Mr. Rabuka closed that.  He should 
<br/></span><span>ask Mr. Rabuka and get details why he did that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now upgrading the road up to Yalavou Farm.  We have established 
<br/>10 paddocks with complete fencing, we are doing double fencing on the outside parameters as well.  
<br/></span><span>We have completed clearing five hectares of bush.  It has big, lush trees and we need D4 to get them 
<br/></span><span>down to be cleared because it has been there from 1998.  About 60 cattle was there, what happened

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the rest?  No one knows, it was abandoned.  Quarters were left empty. There is a primary school 
<br/>there that is  run down and just a few students  going to  that primary school adjacent to  Yalavou 
<br/>school because before it was full as children of the labourers and the officers were studying in that 
<br/>primary school.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they abandoned the entire infrastructure and walked away.  When 
<br/>I went there three years ago, I saw a mechanical garage just lying there with parts.  That is how they 
<br/>treated agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, none of the speakers on the other side talked about the agriculture model 
<br/>that we are pursuing.  If you read our strategic plan, there are two  critical objectives that we are 
<br/>pursuing.  One is, we want to ensure food and nutritional security for households in Fiji.  There are 
<br/>two key aspects of food security; availability and affordability.  Of course, in urban areas, those 
<br/>households living in high rises, two-storey and three-storey flats and working in town, you do not 
<br/>expect them to plant, but it should be available and affordable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not go and regulate the price of vegetables to make it affordable.  
<br/>We were under a lot of pressure during COVID-19 when vegetable prices had gone up, the Ministry 
<br/>should regulate the price.  Of course, we cannot, we do not have a price control order to regulate 
<br/>the  price  of  vegetables.    The  only  way  you  regulate  prices  is,  if  you  have  price  control  order.  
<br/>Unfortunately, on the other day, honourable Professor Prasad was talking about FCCC.  He does 
<br/>not understand the various roles of FCCC.  He never talked about mergers and acquisitions, and 
<br/>regulated industry.  He has no experience in that.  I was the Chairman, I know about that and I know 
<br/>the amount of work that they were doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to vegetables, Mr. Speaker, Sir, vegetable prices are not regulated.  They were with a 
<br/>lot of pressure.  We said that the only sustainable way to deal with the rising price of vegetables is 
<br/>to boost supply - produce, expand production, increase supply, it will bring down prices.  Exactly 
<br/>that is what happened, Mr. Speaker.  All of us here have done shopping and bought vegetables from 
<br/>roadside stalls.  All of us have seen the number of new stalls that have sprung up around roadsides, 
<br/>along streets, et cetera. That is the sustainable way and it is our responsibility to ensure that we do 
<br/>not face a situation of food inflation.  The FAO Report have revealed that food inflation is rampant 
<br/>all around the world, but not in Fiji.  It is our responsibility at the Ministry of Agriculture that we 
<br/>do the right investment to ensure that food prices are kept at check, at least, agricultural produce,  
<br/>staple food - </span><span>dalo</span><span>, cassava, rice and dhal, the rest would be add-ons and top-ups.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On food security, honourable Professor Prasad admitted that during COVID-19 when his 
<br/></span><span>own friend, Mr. Richard Naidu, was congratulating me for distributing seed packs when there is 
<br/></span><span>COVID,  they  asked,  “Do  you  not  understand  that  when  people  move,  the  virus  moves?”    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we took the risk to ensure that those people who were locked up during curfew hours 
<br/>and staying home, had a lot of free time and would utilise the free area around their house and secure 
<br/>their household with regard to basic vegetable farming.  That is how we were able to mobilise the 
<br/>entire country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  had  a  long  line  in  front  of  Raiwaqa  Office,  people  coming  to  ask  for 
<br/>vegetable seeds.  They were laughing about us giving them small seed packs.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this 
<br/>is for a 1 metre x 3 metre garden.  How much seeds do you need?  You do not need a kilogramme 
<br/></span><span>of seeds.  These are small seed packs for home gardening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, at the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had a different package for farmers called Farm 
<br/>Response Package.  This package was for farmers who needed seeds or planting material - suckers, 
<br/></span><span>cuttings, et cetera, for one acre, half acre or two acres.  In the special COVID-19 Budget, $1 million 
<br/></span><span>was allocated to Ministry of Agriculture for this particular activity - food security, home gardening 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1383 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and farm response package, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we accounted for every dollar that was given to 
<br/>us and a few cents was returned to the Ministry of Economy at the end of the year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, still on food security, commercial agriculture and export agriculture - our 
<br/>methodology  or  model  is  to  have  agriculture  expansion  and  supply  based  on  market  signal  led 
<br/>demand-driven approach, not what other honourable Members from the other side are saying - that 
<br/>we should push production and supply based on subsidies.  It will fail, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is 
<br/>why the rice industry previously failed because the subsidies and grants went up to 65 percent self-
<br/>sufficiency in the 1980s but it was based on a wrong model.  The model was that rice production 
<br/>was based on subsidies.  When the subsidies was withdrawn in the late 1980s, rice production started 
<br/>to fall and declined.  It came to about 12 percent or 13 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That was the 1980s?  Who was in Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last three years, we have got to about 21 
<br/>percent and my feeling is that this year, it will be about 22 percent to 23 percent.  We want to get 
<br/>the agriculture sector into a model which is sustainable going forward and it should be demand-
<br/>driven  rather  than  driven  by  grants  and  subsidies.  Having  said  that,  none  of  them  argued  and 
<br/>identified the binding constraints in Fiji’s agriculture sector, not even honourable Professor Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have identified the critical binding constraints in agriculture sector and 
<br/>we  are  working  on  them,  be  it  land  availability,  lease  renewal,  mechanisation,  availability  of 
<br/>planting material, technology - these are the critical binding constraints that have been bothering 
<br/>the agriculture sector which is slowing down the growth.  I have been around to the rural areas and 
<br/>the  deep  interior  and  I  have  been  talking  to  farmers.    I  told  them  that  if  they  wanted  to  treat 
<br/>agriculture as a business then one thing they must do is to save and invest. That is not happening in 
<br/>the rural and interior agriculture sector and that is the critical binding constraint that is lacking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why do </span><span>mataqal</span><span>i and villages with large tracts of land have a stagnant growth?  It is stagnant 
<br/>because they are not saving and investing and therefore they are not creating surplus.  If they do not 
<br/>create surplus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how will they invest? What will they invest because they are not 
<br/>creating surplus.  There is nothing to save and invest so they will sit down and say that if something 
<br/>is given externally then they will invest - we will give the initial leverage, the planting material and 
<br/>we will assist in land preparation but they will need to grow for the market.  That is what it means 
<br/>when you want to treat agriculture or your farm as a business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The critical attributes of a farming business is to grow for the market; create surplus; and 
<br/>part of it you save, spend on your household and invest. That is how every year when you invest in 
<br/>your farm it will grow as a business. You ask any business person.  No business person, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, will tell you that without savings and investments we can grow.  Of course you top-up that pool 
<br/>of investment money that you require by borrowing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A growing business person may not have enough of savings, they will go to the financial 
<br/>sector and that is exactly what we have done for the first time ever.  With half a million dollars from 
<br/>the  Government  budget  approved  by  Cabinet  we  have  established  a  new  programme  called 
<br/></span><span>Commercial  Farmers  Equity  Package.    In  this  Commercial  Farmers  Equity  Package  if  someone 
<br/></span><span>needs $100,000 to buy an excavator or a tractor we assess the application, we fill up the form for 
<br/>FDB, take it to FDB, convince FDB to give loan $100,000 to the farmer and we pay 20 percent of 
<br/>the equity contribution  - $20,000.

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have given this to seven farmers this year for commercial investment.  
<br/>One in  Lautoka has established a manufacturing plant to manufacture cassava flour and cassava 
<br/>starch, and he is exporting.  He has started to export in a small way now and he is expanding.  He 
<br/>has now created a new market for cassava farmers who want to grow cassava in that area.  Once he 
<br/>further expands, he will buy all cassava from Lautoka, Ba and nearby areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done is used our strategic plan, looked at the key strategies 
<br/>and from that we redefined the model that we want to use for agriculture growth and development, 
<br/>identified the new programmes and said these are the programmes which will allow us to expand 
<br/>agriculture.    Programmes  like  provision  of  planting  material,  land  preparation,  and  protected 
<br/>agriculture.   We have said that we do not want hotels to come and tell us that they are only able to 
<br/>get produce during the season.  Where is the produce during the off-season?  We have to import.  
<br/>We  are  now  setting  up  hydroponics  and  greenhouses,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  providing  fencing 
<br/>material.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why are we importing livestock meat into the country?  It is because we have got a large 
<br/>number of smallholder farms which are not able to go into medium or large holdings because they 
<br/>do not have fencing material, so we are targeting that.  This time around we gave 260 farmers with 
<br/>beef cattle, fencing material and we said that we will monitor your farm and the successful one we 
<br/>will construct a stockyard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are talking about impact.  I have said repeatedly that if you want to 
<br/>talk about impact, just look at the production data.  What is the production data?  What is the export 
<br/>data?  For the first time ever we were able to surpass sugar.  Every time when agriculture sector’s 
<br/>discussion  was  happening,  non-sugar  agriculture  was  not  in  the  picture  because  they  were  not 
<br/>bringing in much export revenue.  It was only sugar.  For the first time ever in 2018, our exports 
<br/>went up to $106 million over sugar exports $101 million.  In 2021, non-sugar agriculture exports 
<br/>went to $123 million and sugar went down further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we are saying is – what is your benchmark for performance?  Is it in 
<br/>export income?  Let us look at production - after feeding the entire country, the surplus was exported 
<br/>and the surplus started to increase.  Look at key commodities like ginger – the production went up 
<br/>from 9,398 tonnes to 13,850.  Is that not a performance indicator?  </span><span>Dalo</span><span> production went up from 
<br/>2019 - 51,500 to 54,000 in 2021.  </span><span>Yaqona</span><span> production went up from 11,000 tonnes in 2019 to 13,000 
<br/>tonnes in  2021.   Is that  not  a performance indicator?  Turmeric production went  up  from  1,200 
<br/></span><span>tonnes in 2019 to 2300 tonnes in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall production of agriculture, total value of agriculture output went up 
<br/>from $598 million in 2014 to $756 million in 2020.  What else do they want?  This is the Fiji Bureau 
<br/>of  Statistics  data  I  am  talking  about.    This  is  the  table.    What  honourable  Kuridrani  showed 
<br/>yesterday, a decline in GDP was total output in the country?  He does not even know the difference 
<br/>between total GDP and agricultural GDP.  He does not know how to read this table.  Read this table! 
<br/>Borrow it from me, spend some time with me or spend some time with your final-year economist 
<br/>there.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.   In fact, 
<br/></span><span>taking a closer look at honourable Prasad’s motion, I was kind of a bit flabbergasted because he is 
<br/>saying that this committee should be set up to assess the impact of direct initiatives to farmers in 
<br/>the agriculture sector in particular distribution of seeds, seedlings for cash crops, help in the form 
<br/></span><span>of  materials  provided  to  dairy  farmers,  provision  of  irrigation  pumps,  piping,  rice  planting, 
<br/></span><span>ploughing and harrowing of land by Ministry of Agriculture, handling of breeder goats/sheep and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1385 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report back at the next sitting of Parliament.  All of these to be assessed and come back in next 
<br/>sitting of Parliament which may be in three weeks’ time.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that confirms 
<br/>that this is more of a political stunt than anything else.  I think honourable Professor Prasad needs 
<br/>to be upfront about this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly, he quoted the World Bank IFC Report - he loves to quote 
<br/>them when it suits him and he condemns them when it does not suit him.  He says the World Bank 
<br/>put up the figures with us in poverty and now he is sort of quoting from that, but actually if one 
<br/>reads this report in the way that it was written – and we welcome these reports because these reports 
<br/>does give a third party analysis on some of the shortcomings that we may have, and we all need to 
<br/>know that there are shortcomings and how we can improve upon them.  What can we do to address 
<br/>them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  not  all  size  fits  all  too,  for  example,  what  he  did  not  mention  and  inform 
<br/>Parliament, in fact the World Bank and IFC always wants us to remove price control.  They do not 
<br/>want price control on bread, everyone in this Parliament wants price control on bread.  Everyone in 
<br/>this Parliament wants price control on wheat flour, yet World Bank does not want it.  That paragraph 
<br/>is  there  on  page  11,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    He  forgot  to  mention  that  and  I  am  sure  the  honourable 
<br/>Naulumatua wants price control removed; it gives her the freedom to charge what price she believes 
<br/>the  market  should  dictate,  but  they  are  beholden  to  price  control  because  that  is  what  has  been 
<br/>dictated through regulatory framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he talked about how our agro logistics were 200 percent higher 
<br/>than other ports in Asia-Pacific.  When they mention Asia-Pacific, they are talking about countries 
<br/>like  Indonesia,  Thailand,  Vietnam,  Philippines,  Singapore;  the  throughput  at  those  wharves  are 
<br/>thousands of times higher than Fiji.  Obviously, the volume is higher, the cost will be lower and this 
<br/>is  one  of  the  things  that  we  have  always  been  saying  to  the  World  Bank  and  the  International 
<br/>Monetary Fund (IMF) of the world - do not put us in Asia-Pacific,  put us in the Pacific category 
<br/>only and only then can we compare apples with apples. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way for example, they have talked about the sector analysis estimated cargo fees 
<br/>in inter-island shipping are double that of Papua New Guinea, a country with a population of nearly 
<br/>9 million people and Philippines, a country with a population of about 65 million and we are not 
<br/>even 900,000.  Obviously our cost in inter-island shipping will be higher.  To then sort of randomly 
<br/>and only selectively choose these quotes from these studies, he is again not being upfront with what 
<br/></span><span>the analysis does put forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  says  that  while  Fiji’s  air  transport  connectivity  for  passengers  is  excellent,  there  is 
<br/>significant room for improvement in the country’s air freight services.  We accept that and in fact 
<br/>there  is  some  work  currently  being  carried  out  with  Fiji  Airways.    Honourable  Members  of  the 
<br/>Opposition condemned the purchase of A350, but for the first time you have an aircraft that can 
<br/>carry up to 30 tonnes, so it is as big as it is on top as it is at the bottom; it can carry a lot of freight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He failed to mention one of his former candidates in the last Elections, the CEO of Nature’s 
<br/>Way, Brown, who was your candidate.  We can tell you about some of the shenanigans that takes 
<br/></span><span>place there which is completely 100 percent Government funded.  Government, in fact, set it up and 
<br/></span><span>left it to these co-operatives to run.  We know what went on there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  I  just  wanted  to  highlight  that  the  honourable  Prasad  is  very 
<br/></span><span>selective.  There are numerous sort of positives that came out of it.  In this report it says that Fiji

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  of  Fiji  has  taken  several  steps  to  improve  its  investment  legal  and 
<br/>regulatory regime.  A new investment law that includes a full range of investor rights and 
<br/>protection in accordance with international best practises was drafted and passed in Fiji’s 
<br/>Parliament in June, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of Fiji has made significant efforts to streamline the process for example, 
<br/>launched  an  online  platform  for  registration,  enabling  online  registration  for  tax 
<br/>identifications simplified requirements to obtain a business licence, reducing processing 
<br/>time  from  11  to  two  days  and  eliminating  the  business  licence  and  frameworks  since 
<br/>August 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Over the last decade access to education at all levels has significantly increased due to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduction of subsidies in scholarships.

<div><span>Fiji’s financial system is one of the most developed in the Pacific Island countries with 
<br/>the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  development  while 
<br/>maintaining financial stability.  If you are listening to them I think this is not happening in 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has high levels of access to energy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has been at the forefront of climate change agenda due to the adverse effects on its 
<br/>economy, people and livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s potential is an outsourcing hub in the Asia and Pacific region is yet to be fully tapped 
<br/>and  could  provide  Fiji’s  economy  with  climate  resilience  and  source  of  growth  and 
<br/>inclusive jobs particularly for youth and women. When we talked about outsourcing they 
<br/></span><span>said ‘Oh, pie in the sky’, that is what they said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is a competitive value preposition as an outsourcing destination offering relatively 
<br/>well educated and accent neutral English speaking workforce, a friendly service culture, 
<br/>sound ICT infrastructure, low labour cost and a near sure status for a large reasonable 
<br/>source markets such as Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact tomorrow afternoon after lunch we are meeting a company from 
<br/>UK that is looking at creating about 2,000 to 3,000 jobs in the outsourcing services sector.  But, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I digress and I come back to the fundamental issue.  Honourable Sachida Nand actually 
<br/></span><span>tapped into this about the certainty that is required in the agricultural sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I go back again to leases pertaining to agricultural leases.  In Fiji for years, you leased State 
<br/>land or leased an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, for tourism it is 99 years, residential is 99 years, commercial is 99 
<br/></span><span>years, industrial it is 99 years, agriculture it is 30 years.  No mainstream banks lend in the agriculture 
<br/></span><span>sector unless the land you have is freehold.

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- … is he your next party Leader - uh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- … used to have crop liens.  I worked in Colonial and their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crop lien culture went to Colonial, I do not know whether BSP is doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FDB now is the only institution that lends to farmers and subsidised by Government 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Agriculture has not seen the level of investment that agriculture still requires to 
<br/>be an active participant in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century agriculture global sector. You need mechanisation.  Under 
<br/>the Bainimarama Government and now the FijiFirst Government, the sugarcane industry is now 
<br/>getting cane harvesters, one third paid for by Government, two thirds are loaned from FDB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you have five-acre farms, three-acre farms, four acre-farms you will 
<br/>not get that level of production, that volume will not be there so obviously your cost structure will 
<br/>be higher. These are some of the fundamental  issues that affect  and has affected the agriculture 
<br/>sector in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members from the other side continuously do not want to address this issue, 
<br/>continuously want to undermine the land tenure system Mr. Speaker, Sir, for political advantage, 
<br/>political gain not looking at how we can increase the productive capacity of our country and indeed 
<br/>specifically in this instance the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that they went on about is the dairy industry. I still have 
<br/>until today in my drawer in the office, a receipt for Rewa Dairy Cooperative where the CEO bought 
<br/>a Rolex watch from Prouds funded by Rewa Dairy. The debt stock of Rewa Dairy was so high and 
<br/>the farmers were actually liable for that debt, that debt has gone.  They are now Class B shareholders 
<br/>without  having  to  be  liable  for  the  liabilities  of  the  company.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  only  get 
<br/>dividends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that honourable Seruiratu also highlighted and honourable 
<br/></span><span>Dr.  Reddy  had  touched  upon,  1987  saw  huge  brain  drain  of  people  in  the  agriculture  sector, 
<br/></span><span>veterinarians left, scientists left.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think honourable Seruiratu mentioned a story where the Honourable Prime Minister and 
<br/>the honourable Seruiratu  had gone to  Thailand where in  one of the  companies is  one of the top 
<br/>scientists that was actually someone from Fiji.  He worked there and they praised him, he had moved 
<br/>along but he is such a good scientist.  I was recently in Wagga Wagga where I met a gentleman 
<br/>where his father had left Fiji in 1987.  He was a Groundwater Specialist, left in 1987 and Australians 
<br/>obviously use him to the maximum.  There is a lot of brain drain issues that are taking place that 
<br/>affected the agriculture sector too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was the point pertaining to the 
<br/>encouragement of training through the scholarships and with TELS. We are now seeing more and 
<br/>more people in the agriculture sector, there are a couple of more veterinarians that have actually 
<br/></span><span>come in to the Agriculture sector to be able to get our people trained.  If you look at the Toppers, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a number of years we have had a proclivity in the Toppers.  About 70 percent

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the places were reserved for the science area, foresters and marine scientists. All those people in 
<br/>the science areas that we needed to ensure that that gives increase in productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not the least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kuridrani always talks about what will 
<br/>the Government do et cetera.  We have what they call, Fijian chestnuts (</span><span>ivi</span><span>). We have breadfruit, in 
<br/>Nadroga  we  have  got  what  we  call  </span><span>wichiwichi</span><span>  (Fijian  mandarin)  -  beautiful  and  very  sweet. 
<br/>Honourable Kuridrani knows about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, mango, jackfruit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-.- Yes and honourable Gavoka knows about it too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we do not have </span><span>ivi</span><span> orchards, we do not have breadfruit tree orchards, 
<br/>we  do  not  have  </span><span>wichiwichi  </span><span>orchards  and  we  do  not  have  mango  orchards  and  there  is  nothing 
<br/>stopping the people from developing those orchards. There are 56 varieties of mango in Legalega.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- In Legalega - 56 varieties of mango.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- 56 varieties of mango - they will give it to you for free. 
<br/>People have the land, you can go and get it from them. There is a lot of opportunities. We need to 
<br/>take up commercial farming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are serious about it there is no point, honourable Tuisawau, going on 
<br/>about  all  these  external  factors  -  it  is  available.  The  land  is  there,  the  opportunity  is  there  and 
<br/>agriculture will make it available.  We need to be able to think on a commercial basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of the people on the other side of the Parliament do not think on a commercial basis. 
<br/>We need the volume then we can have factories. We used to have a pineapple factory in the colonial 
<br/>days.  I  understand  where  the  airport  was,  they  used  to  grow  pineapples  and  there  used  to  be  a 
<br/>pineapple factory in Lautoka somewhere.  In Levuka too. Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point is that there are opportunities. We need to think on a commercial 
<br/>basis and people need to be able to take a long-term approach to agriculture. It does not happen 
<br/>overnight. So honourable Professor Prasad, I am quite surprised that  you brought this motion to 
<br/>have an assessment of things like giving out of seeds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  actually  honourable  Reddy  has  explained  that  we  did  this  during  the  COVID-19 
<br/>period where a lot of people stayed home, a lot of people did not have jobs, a lot of people wanted 
<br/>to start a small little plantation (</span><span>i teitei</span><span>) at the back of their yard which is fine.  It suited the particular 
<br/>purpose but that does not happen now.  It is not a continuous basis but hopefully it engenders a 
<br/>culture of growing things at your own backyard.  But from a commercial perspective, obviously, 
<br/>we need to take a long-term view of this. We need to seriously address the issue of land tenure 
<br/>accessibility of long-term leases for agricultural purposes otherwise we will be still talking about 
<br/>the same things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, one last point I wanted to make is that there are many other fruits that 
<br/></span><span>are available.  Jackfruit  (</span><span>uto  ni  Idia</span><span>) </span><span>dawa</span><span> -  all  of these things.   Like what  the American’s  call 
<br/>‘moringa’, I know that French organization does a little bit of it - </span><span>saijan</span><span>. If you went to cane farm 
<br/>(most people know a bit of cane farms), we always find the house, you will find a </span><span>saijan</span><span> tree, a 
<br/></span><span>tamarind tree, a lemongrass tree, a mango tree - these basic trees are all there but because of the 
<br/></span><span>inability for the Ministry of Agriculture since the 1970s to look at these crops from a commercial 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>perspective, “Oh, you know that is </span><span>uto ni Idia</span><span>, that is </span><span>saijan</span><span>, who wants to be interested in that.”, 
<br/>suddenly when the Americans have said that it is a super food, everyone wants to get in to the act. 
<br/>It grows wildly in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to change our attitude towards agriculture.  We have had turmeric in Fiji for ages.  
<br/>We were up in Keiyasi a few weeks ago, talking to all the landowners over there. There is wild 
<br/>turmeric growing. They actually go and dig it up and selling it $1.20 or $1.30 per kilogramme. It 
<br/>has been there but no one has taken a commercial approach to it. There was limitation in the way 
<br/>that they thought in the Ministry of Agriculture previously.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  we  are  serious  about  it,  we  need  to  expand  our  horizons  and 
<br/>unfortunately, in the mode of expanding our horizons, this motion is actually a very limited horizon.  
<br/>In fact, it does not even have a horizon, that is why I object to this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Professor Prasad to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Members 
<br/>who have spoken on  this motion,  especially my  Opposition  colleagues  who have supported this 
<br/>motion. What we have heard from the Government side this afternoon, is not surprising, given their 
<br/>complete disrespect for any kind of bipartisanship or any kind of committee work that would look 
<br/>at or analyse and evaluate the Government’s performance or a particular Ministry’s performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just remind the Government side, that I have been in Parliament for seven years since 
<br/>2014 not a single motion by the Opposition on any investigation or inquiry had been accepted by 
<br/>the FijiFirst Party in Government.  I know, once the former Member of FijiFirst Party, Dr. Neil 
<br/>Sharma, supported a motion because he understood the motion on health and obviously we all know 
<br/>what his fate was after that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that some of the silent 25 privately, actually probably agree that 
<br/>this  motion  is  a  good  motion  but  obviously  they  cannot  and  if  they  vote  against  the  motion, 
<br/>obviously they know their fate.  This is very typical of a government that thinks that it has all the 
<br/>ideas when the reality of the matter is that this Government is actually … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … I am talking about the motion.  You astride long beyond 
<br/>the motion.  It is a Government which does not, as I had said before, believe in bipartisanship, it 
<br/>does not believe in working together and it does not believe in assessing its own performance.  The 
<br/>so called initiatives that we have heard, outlined by the honourable Minister again, apart from what 
<br/>he said yesterday shows that he was actually drowning himself into the details.  I know the typical 
<br/>style of honourable Dr. Reddy and I think a lot of that he probably had learnt from the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General because they are good in drowning into minor details of what they do, try and 
<br/>bamboozle the Parliament  and hoping that they  will be able to  convince the Members out  there 
<br/></span><span>about what they are doing is actually correct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What is the ....

<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I listened to him very carefully when he 
<br/>was speaking  so he should learn to listen as well.  This motion was very simple.  It was about the 
<br/>initiatives and why we need to critically examine their effectiveness.  We have been hearing a lot 
<br/>of  these  issues  out  there,  as  they  do  as  well,  but  obviously  they  think  that  they  have  their  own 
<br/>evaluation system and they have their own mechanics to deal with it.  Unfortunately, they do not, 
<br/>because a lot of initiatives they have been putting out have not been evaluated, a lot of promises 
<br/>they have made in the past, and we know the promises they made after 2014.  I know the programme 
<br/>where they were supposed to train students in agriculture and provide them land and money to go 
<br/>and do business that has fallen apart. So, there are a lot of issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I could go 
<br/>on and on with respect to how things have not worked and that is why it was very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are stories about what happened in Navua, for example.  There are people who were 
<br/>complaining about how only certain people in certain localities known to the minister, known to the 
<br/>agriculture staff have benefitted. So, these are all the concerns about how these initiatives are being 
<br/>rolled out and whether they are effective or not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  seem  to  be  straying  away  from  the  real  substance  of  the  motion, 
<br/>honourable Usamate you cannot say, “you cannot do it in four weeks or whatever” this is a very 
<br/>simple  motion.    The  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  they  go  on  big 
<br/>motions, big reports within a month, if they do their work, they could get a very clear macro-picture 
<br/>of what is happening as a result of those initiative and that would be helpful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But let me just respond to some specific issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the only sensible 
<br/>contribution  that came on the motion  was from  honourable  Inia Seruiratu from  the  Government 
<br/>side.  I think he talked about direct initiative and he made this important point.  He said and I quote, 
<br/>“we will have time to assess that” we are saying that, that time is right now because spending is an 
<br/>investment but if you are spending and not evaluating and that you leave it for the next four years 
<br/>or five years and then you find like so many other initiatives, that initiative has not worked.  The 
<br/>spending has been wasted, it has had no effect so I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important that 
<br/>policies are evaluated, initiatives are evaluated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They go on and on about what has government done, what have they spent, yes spending is 
<br/>fine.  You can keep talking about it but what is the impact of that spending?  Then of course, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we had honourable Bala and as usual, he did not even understand the motion.  He was 
<br/>saying this motion is about an update.  He did not even understand and then when I said it is not an 
<br/></span><span>update, it is an inquiry then he corrected himself towards the end. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- and he said and I quote, “and Mr. Speaker, Sir, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.B. KUMAR.- I said inquiry…

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He said, “Mr. Speaker, Sir, I talk to the farmers”, I know he

<div><span>is everywhere.  This is what he does. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is all over the place using government resources, government vehicle, a driver, to attend 
<br/>weddings and funerals and temples.  So, I know, but he should say that he does that at the expense 
<br/>of the State.

<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- So that is what they do and the other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>is he said “honourable Prasad does not understand the idea of leases”.  He obviously has no idea… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I never  mention that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  is  talking  about  the  production  of 
<br/>sugarcane and he keeps talking about production going down because of the leases began expiring 
<br/>from 1997, 1998 and after 2000 but in 2006, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had 3.2 million tonnes of cane 
<br/>being produced with 18,000 growers and over the last 15 years when they have been in-charge, the 
<br/>production is now down to 1.4 million to 1.5 million tonnes with 12, 000 to 13,000 farmers.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What did your Government do if lease was a problem, if we 
<br/></span><span>are producing 3.2 million tonnes in 2006 and this Government came into power in 2006, you cannot 
<br/>keep talking about leases for the last 15 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Why not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because in 2006, it is a simple fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Under this Government, the leases were renewed.  I raised 
<br/>this in Parliament and the honourable Prime Minister did answer that and he said that he was going 
<br/></span><span>to look into it.  Seaqaqa Farmers were paying $30,000 to $40,000 in lease premiums.

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am just responding to him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am just responding to him.  I have talked about the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already.  This is my right of reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  is  my  right  of  reply  to  what  has  come  out  from  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government side.  I have talked about the motion already.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So this lie that honourable Bala keeps telling and this is what he tells, this is what he goes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in little pocket meetings, in funerals, in weddings and says,…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-What is your problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is what is happening.  He keeps lying about what has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Dr. Reddy, as I said, drowned himself into details.  He was throwing statistics 
<br/>here, throwing statistics there but he ignored and the honourable Attorney-General said I did not 
<br/>raise the point.  I was actually talking about the aggrieved business sector.  That is the report that I 
<br/>was  quoting.    When  I  talk  about  the  other  sectors,  I  will  say  what  this  report  says  about  the 
<br/>Government but this report …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Honourable  Attorney-General,  I  was  responding  to  the 
<br/>agriculture sector and all the binding constraints that are there.  Basically, the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General was side-tracking and not admitting that this report actually states very clearly the binding 
<br/>constraints  in  the  agriculture  sector.    They  talk  about  a  number  of  things  which  I  highlighted 
<br/>yesterday.  He talked about what he did when he was in the Commerce Commission.  I remember 
<br/>when  he  was  the  Chairman  of  the  Commerce  Commission,  he  recommended  $75  a  bag  for  a 
<br/>fertiliser  because  he  just  had  no  idea,  no  understanding  of  what  was  going  on.    I  mean  he  was 
<br/>basically parroting, so …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I listen to him very carefully 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when he was speaking, so he should listen to me.

<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1393 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject)       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- A Point of Order.  Babu! Babu, </span><span>bhaito</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad just mentioned that 
<br/>the Commerce Commission set fertiliser prices at $75.  The Commerce Commission does not set 
<br/>fertiliser prices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I said he recommended as Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Liar, liar! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  implore  on  them  again  that  they 
<br/>should let me talk because when they were all talking, I sat down and listened to them carefully.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Koya, in his drive and zeal to go personal, I am not going to go there, but all I 
<br/>want to say to him from his own experience, before the 2018 Elections, I know honourable Koya 
<br/>was throughout the country, even two weeks before the Elections.  I had a meeting in Dreketi and 
<br/>two weeks later, he ended up there. He probably would have shaken thousands of hands, delivering 
<br/>$1,000 cash grant and at that time, some of us were saying you know we needed an evaluation.  I 
<br/>do not think we still have an evaluation of all the millions of dollars that were distributed for Small, 
<br/>Medium or Micro Enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to hit him below the belt but after distributing all that and shaking 
<br/>hands, he still could not make it to Parliament.  He had to wait until one of his colleague got sacked 
<br/>then he came here.  So, that is the logic of this motion that when you are putting out initiatives, if 
<br/>you have an opportunity, if you have time you must look at the effectiveness of those.  This was a 
<br/></span><span>very simple motion and in fact, it would have helped them but all they did here was to play politics.  
<br/></span><span>You know play to the gallery.  They always claim we are playing politics but they are all politicians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVT. MEMBER.- That is what  you are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know you are making a lot of noise because you are caught 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out now. That is what you do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  So,  Mr.  Speaker,  let  me  also  respond  to  the  Honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  where  he  talked  about  research.    I  know  I  have  talked  about  this  before  in 
<br/></span><span>Parliament. In fact, you know in the 1970s and 1980s, we had one of the best research, training and 
<br/></span><span>extension within the agriculture sector.

<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I remember we  passed a Bill for  a National Research Council and we talked 
<br/>about how that National Research Council was going to be linked to different sectors, ministries, 
<br/>different  sectors  of  the  economy,  conducting  research,  looking  at  evaluating  policies  and 
<br/>understanding where we are going right and where we are going wrong.  Now, that has not seen the 
<br/>light of day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  they  keep  talking  about  leases.  I  mean  if  I  heard  the  Honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General correctly he said, “All those leases under ALTA, farmers never got loan”.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order.  I did not say what you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said I said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- You said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, you said all farmers are under Agricultural Landlord 
<br/>and Tenant Act (ALTA). I said that when you have short term leases, Sir, no one lends you money.  
<br/>I said there  used to be crop lease and used to be given by NBF then Colonial Bank and now Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank lends farmers at subsidise rates but no one gives long-term and large loans on 
<br/>short term leases which is a fact.  I never said ALTA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  all  farmers  who  had  30  years  leases  under 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ALTA and I know this because I have studied those farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from FDB, Bank of Baroda, Mr. Speaker, has been lending to farmers for a very long 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time in this country.  Yes, I mean security of tenure is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that the Honourable Attorney-General talked about … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- No, I did not say that. Mr. Speaker, I was just correcting him 
<br/>that farmers did get loan.  Everyone would like to have long-term leases and we have talked about 
<br/>it and we understood that and some of us have advocated that for years that long-term security of 
<br/>tenure is very important for productivity.  So, that is what I want to correct, that they did get loan 
<br/>even with short-term leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, I mean they quite shamelessly use the word, “Paapi” which 
<br/>means sinner. They keep talking about 1987. They keep talking about National Bank of Fiji (NBF), 
<br/>I mean they talked about the collapsed of the National Bank of Fiji but the guy who actually presided 
<br/>over the collapse of the NBF is a good friend of theirs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- They know that.  You know they send him as ambassador 
<br/>and now they recently appointed him as the Chairman of the Fiji Higher Education Commission 
<br/></span><span>(FHEC).  So, let us be honest, Mr. Speaker, they are playing politics.  They are thinking that if we 
<br/></span><span>keep talking about NBF, if we keep talking about 1987, if we keep talking about Rabuka then they 
<br/>forget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they forget that yes - 1987 happened.  Nobody forgets the atrocities.  Nobody 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forgets what happened but what happened after 1987, what happened after 1992, what happened
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1395 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after 1994 Election, what happened when we had the 1997 Constitution, we also need to talk about 
<br/>what happened in 2000, we also need to talk about what happened in 2006 and the impact.  In that 
<br/>Constitution, honourable Prime Minister, you also have the immunity provision for Mr. Rabuka.  If 
<br/>you have so much hate for the guy, why did you give him the immunity?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are looking forward.  We are putting ideas.  We are thinking for the future.  
<br/>We are not going back 35 years.  We are not forgetting what happened 35 years ago.  We are not 
<br/>forgetting what happened 22 years ago in 2000.  We have not forgotten what happened in 2006, but 
<br/>we have to look forward.  We have to look to the future and when we bring a motion like this to 
<br/>Parliament, we are looking at the future.  We are looking at creating a system, an environment in 
<br/>Parliament where Government and Opposition can work together, can agree on certain aspects of 
<br/>an inquiry or investigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they sit in the opposition, Mr. Speaker and when we are in government, we will treat 
<br/>them well.  We will treat them very well.  We will respect them.  We will work together and if they 
<br/>bring a motion which we feel is important, that needs our support, that we need to evaluate our 
<br/>policies, we will support that.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, they are not in that mode and I still urge 
<br/>them to think about this motion, support this.  Let the Standing Committee on which they have the 
<br/></span><span>majority of the Members, to do that so that we create a better environment, a better understanding 
<br/></span><span>of how we can assist the farmers and how we can make agriculture more sustainable in this country.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for his reply.  Honourable Members, the 
<br/></span></div>
