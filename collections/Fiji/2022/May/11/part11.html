<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the National Fire Authority (NFA) for 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) which mandates 
<br/>the Committee to look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and 
<br/>media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  first  met  to  deliberate  in  April  of  this  year  and  formulated  questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pertaining to the Annual Report, which were sent to NFA for its response. Upon receipt of all

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relevant  information  on  the  Committee’s  queries,  the  Committee  compiled  its  findings  and 
<br/>subsequently endorsed its Report in May.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  pertinent  findings  emanating  from  the  scrutiny  of  NFA’s  Annual  Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>included the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total  income  for  2015  was  recorded  at  $12.5  million,  compared  to  $14.3  million 
<br/>recorded for the year 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  number  of  incidents  attended  to  by  NFA  during  the  year  totalled  6,846  which 
<br/>includes,  attending  to  127  property  fires;  1,714  grass/bush/cane/rubbish  fires;  162 
<br/>special  services/malicious/others;  80  vehicle  fires;  2  ship  and  boat  fires;  135  road 
<br/>accident rescue; 899 private fire alarms; 2 Swift Water Rescue and 3,725 emergency 
<br/>ambulance service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a decrease in the total number of fires that the Authority responded to during 
<br/>the year from 143 in 2014 to 127 in 2015. The main cause of fires continues to be 
<br/>electrical related and whilst there was 11 percent reduction in the total structural fires, 
<br/>there is a still much need for a change in public perspective and attitude towards fire 
<br/>safety.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Chief Executive Officer of the National Fire Authority 
<br/>and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process.  I also extend my gratitude to my 
<br/>Committee colleagues, namely; honourable George Vegnathan (Deputy Chairperson), honourable 
<br/>Alipate Nagata, honourable Salote Radrodro and honourable Dr. Ratu Atonio Lalabalavu, for their 
<br/>contributions during the Committee’s deliberations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs,  I  commend  this  Report  to 
<br/>Parliament and request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance Annual Reports 2019 and 2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 
<br/></span><span>to  submit to Parliament, the  Consolidated Review Report of the Reserve Bank of Fiji  Insurance 
<br/>Annual Reports for the years 2019 and 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Insurance is an essential risk mitigation and investment tool, therefore, one must endeavour 
<br/></span><span>to safeguard themselves from possible risks and uncertainties. Vehicle accidents, house fires or even 
<br/></span><span>workplace injuries are just some of the many instances where unexpected hardships can occur and

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>insurance has continued to play an important role in mitigating losses of this nature at household, 
<br/>business, national and global level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) plays a pivotal supervisory role in the insurance industry 
<br/>under its financial stability mandate as they ensure that insurance companies remain safe and sound 
<br/>while also delivering quality customer service.  The Committee, while deliberating on the 2019 and 
<br/>2020 Annual Reports agreed that insurance underwriters needed to work with relevant stakeholders 
<br/>to launch collaborative awareness programmes so that insurance covers are seen as risk mitigation 
<br/>factors rather than additional expenses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware that certain insurance companies have made access to their 
<br/>services easier by adapting to digital technology, including but not limited to applications, online 
<br/>payments,  and  possibly  claim  submissions.  Given  the  lessons  that  COVID-19  has  taught  us, 
<br/>initiatives such as these are welcomed and encouraged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Submissions from the Governor of RBF and his team reinforced the Committee’s view that 
<br/>climate change was another area that was expected to persist with its own set of challenges and 
<br/>efforts were being made to increase coverage for disaster risk and mitigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on the success of the Micro Bundled Insurance, the Committee has encouraged the 
<br/>consortium of insurance  underwriters to  come up with  various packages that  is  affordable to  all 
<br/>Fijians.    The  Committee  also  believes  that  further  avenues  could  be  explored  to  include  other 
<br/>agricultural producers such as </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, </span><span>dalo</span><span> and other subsistence farmers, co-operatives and market 
<br/>vendors in Fiji Care’s Micro Bundle Insurance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the Governor of the RBF 
<br/>and  his  team  members,  as  well  as  representatives  from  the  Insurance  Association  of  Fiji  and 
<br/>Licensed Brokers Association for making time to present before the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that  produced  this 
<br/>Report:  the  Deputy  Chairperson  -  honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar,  honourable  Sachida  Nand, 
<br/>honourable  Inosi  Kuridrani,  honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau,  and  I  also  would  like  to  thank 
<br/>honourable George Vegnathan for his input.  I also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank 
<br/>the Parliamentary staff who have given us invaluable support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Review of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance Annual Report 2019-2020 to Parliament.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the following Municipal Councils’ Annual 
<br/>Reports: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua Town Council 2006-2014 Annual Reports; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suva City Council 2006-2015 Annual Reports; 
<br/>Ba Town Council 2006-2018 Annual Reports;

<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Nausori Town Council 2005-2014 Annual Reports; 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Rakiraki Town Council 2011-2018 Annual Reports; 
<br/>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lautoka City Council 2006-2014 Annual Reports; 
<br/>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Sigatoka Town Council 2005-2019 Annual Reports; 
<br/>9.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Savusavu Town Council 2005-2010 Annual Reports; 
<br/>10.</span><span> </span><span>Lami Town Council 2004-2014 Annual Reports; 
<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Levuka Town Council 2005-2011 Annual Reports; 
<br/>12.</span><span> </span><span>Nasinu Town Council 2009-2010 Annual Reports; and  
<br/></span><span>13.</span><span> </span><span>Labasa Town Council 2004-2017 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this constitutes 126 Annual Reports which the Committee has assiduously 
<br/>examined. The Committee was referred these Annual Reports over multiple Parliamentary sessions.  
<br/>Our  plan  was  to  read  the  more  recent  reports  and  formulate  pressing  questions  to  be  sent  to 
<br/>Municipalities for their responses.  However, equal attention was also paid to the more dated Annual 
<br/>Reports and the operational and financial anomalies they contained.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  scrutiny  of  the  Annual  Reports  extensive  communication  was  made  with  the 
<br/>Town and City Councils, either in person through the undertaking of site visits, or via emails and 
<br/>correspondences.  Upon  receipt  of  all  relevant  information  on  the  Committee’s  queries,  the 
<br/>Committee compiled its findings and subsequently endorsed its Report in May.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Review  Report  highlights  the  challenges  faced  by  our  Municipalities  and  proposed 
<br/>recommendations  to  address  them.    In  particular,  we  observed  the  colossal  financial  impact  of 
<br/>COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  operations  of  the  Councils,  some  of  whom  were  facing  financial 
<br/>difficulties even before its onset. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consequently, Councils have had to delay the construction of some of their capital projects 
<br/>due to the diversion of funds to other urgent activities at the time. The pandemic has also resulted 
<br/>in many ratepayers defaulting on their payments due to financial constraints. This has resulted in 
<br/>further  accumulation  of  rate  and  rental  arrears  for  Municipalities,  which  is  highlighted  in  this 
<br/>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Chief Executive Officers of the respective Municipalities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and their staff for availing themselves to assist in this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  extend  my  gratitude  to  my  Committee  colleagues,  namely,  honourable  George 
<br/>Vegnathan  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable  Alipate  Nagata,  honourable  Salote  Radrodro  and 
<br/>honourable  Dr.  Ratu  Atonio  Lalabalavu  for  their  contributions  during  the  Committee’s 
<br/>deliberations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs,  I  commend  this  Report  to 
<br/>Parliament and request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report.

<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Ministry of Forestry 2016-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Consolidated Review 
<br/>Report on the Ministry of Forestry Annual Report for 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019 which 
<br/>was  tabled  in  Parliament  on  7</span><span>th</span><span>  June,  2021  and  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  December,  2021  respectively  during  the 
<br/></span><span>Parliament Sitting and referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for scrutiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  oversight  function  is  to  scrutinise  Government  Departments  with 
<br/>responsibility within the Committee’s mandate and make recommendations relating to any aspect 
<br/>of  functioning,  administration, 
<br/>legislative  programme,  budget, 
<br/>legislation  or  proposed 
<br/>rationalisation, restructuring and policy formulation as legislated under the Parliament’s Standing 
<br/>Orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, I wish to commend the work done by the former Minister for Forestry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the late Honourable Osea Naiqamu, for his leadership and guidance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the deliberations stage, the Committee focused on the overall operations of the Ministry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including its roles and responsibilities and strategic objectives for the years under review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The highlights for the year 2016-2017 was the Department of Forestry’s transition into a 
<br/>single  Ministry  through  Government’s  decision  to  separate  the  Department  of  Fisheries  from 
<br/>Forests. This was necessary for the Ministry to focus more on opportunities available in each of the 
<br/>two  resource-based  agencies  to  be  able  to  contribute  to  the  nation’s  economic  and  social 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  forestry  sector  is  an  integral  primary  sector  in  Fiji  and  apart  from  contributing  to 
<br/>economic  growth,  it  ensures  the  conservation,  sustainable  utilisation  and  management  of  forest 
<br/>resources.  It  plays  a  vital  role  in  Fiji’s  economic,  social  and  environmental  wellbeing,  and 
<br/>contributes to the country’s GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However this does not take into account the other activities that the Department of Forestry 
<br/>is involved with, especially in the value-adding and manufacturing sector.  Forestry is a viable sector 
<br/>which has contributed and supported the growth of a few other sectors and industries.  It is also a 
<br/>vital source of energy, employment, livelihood and ecological integrity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry  of  Forestry’s Silviculture, Research and Development  Programme includes 
<br/>plantation forestry and sustainable management of native forests, including mangrove ecosystem 
<br/>which is another way forward for our forestry industry.  Silviculture is the practice of controlling

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  growth  composition  structure  and  quality  of  forests  to  meet  values  and  needs,  especially  in 
<br/>timber production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major achievements in 2019 has been the tree planting initiative which started in 
<br/>January  2019.    In  the  fight  against  climate  change  and  protecting  our  environment  and  rich 
<br/>biodiversity, the Fijian Government is embarking on the four million trees in the four years initiative 
<br/>as it recognises the important service that forest resources provide in terms of environmental and 
<br/>ecological services, conservation of biodiversity and sustaining livelihoods. However, in September 
<br/>2019, the Government noted that the initiative had resulted in the planting of almost one million 
<br/>trees in nine months.  The honourable Prime Minister then announced the new target of 30 million 
<br/>trees in 15 years, whilst attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 
<br/>2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the major achievements of the Ministry of Forestry during the periods 
<br/>under review even during challenging times.  The Committee commended the Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>for the periods under review that is endeavoured to ensuring equal participation of employment and 
<br/>capacity building for women particularly in forestry, technical training for both, local and overseas.  
<br/>There  was  also  an  increase  in  women  participation  in  both,  employment  and  training.    Moving 
<br/></span><span>the  Committee’s 
<br/>forward, 
<br/></span><span>recommendations as highlighted in the Report and that the Ministry to continue to work towards 
<br/>the commitments and ensuring that all the objectives and key targeted outputs are achieved in an 
<br/>effective and efficient manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Committee  recommends  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  consider 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee wishes to commend the Permanent Secretary, Mr. Pene Baleinabuli, and the 
<br/>staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  for  their  contribution  towards  the  final  compilation  of  the 
<br/>Committee’s Report to Parliament.  I wish to take this time to also acknowledge the Commissioner 
<br/>Northern, the  Officials  from the  Provincial  Office in  Bua and the stakeholders  who  assisted the 
<br/>Committee in every way during their three-day site visit to the North.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not the least, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of 
<br/>the Committee, namely; honourable Jale Sigarara, honourable Alexander O’ Connor, honourable 
<br/>Mitieli  Bulanauca  and  honourable  Jese  Saukuru,  and  the  secretariat  staff  for  their  successful 
<br/>compilation of this bipartisan Report.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs  on the annual review of the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) for 2016 to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 and 2017 to 2018.  This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) 
<br/>which  mandates  the  Committee  to  look  into  issues  related  to  health,  education,  social  service, 
<br/>labour, culture and media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  first  met  to  deliberate  in  April  of  this  year  and  formulated  questions 
<br/>pertaining to  the  Annual  Reports which were sent  to  FRA  for its  response.  Upon receipt of all 
<br/>relevant  information  on  the  Committee’s  queries,  the  Committee  compiled  its  findings  and 
<br/>subsequently endorsed its Report in May.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the pertinent findings emanating from the scrutiny of FRA’s Annual Reports are as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The focus for the 2017-2018 year was the restructure of FRA to bring in processes and 
<br/>procedures to enable it to make decisions that are based on sound governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the 2017-2018 year, FRA was able to carry out maintenance work to the value of 
<br/>$121 million on the road and structure, and a further $38 million was spent on emergency 
<br/>services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new capital works project focussed on the delivery of much needed new assets in 
<br/>support of public safety and accessibility with a major push on providing safe pedestrian 
<br/>access and streetlight.  The 2017-2018 saw the completion of FRA’s first solar streetlights 
<br/>and network.  The total new capital spent for the year was $275 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2017-2018 also marked major expenditure in the new capital access sector which 
<br/>consists of rural roads around the country with a spending of $38 million.  As part of the 
<br/>programme  to  improve  access  throughout  the  country,  FRA’s  asset  renewal  projects 
<br/>recorded a spending of $143 million on roads, bridges and jetties renewal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Authority  also  made  a  major  investment  in  road  safety  for  communities,  which 
<br/>included new footpaths, improving access for people with disabilities, construction of new 
<br/>bus shelters and waiting facilities at the jetties. The FRA spent $18 million in this sector 
<br/>in the 2017-2018 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Chief Executive Officer of the FRA, Mr. Kamal Prasad, 
<br/>and his staff for their timely assistance in this review process.   I also extend my gratitude to my 
<br/>Committee colleagues, namely; honourable George Vegnathan (Deputy Chairperson), honourable 
<br/>Alipate Nagata, honourable Salote Radrodro and honourable Dr. Ratu Atonio Lalabalavu, for their 
<br/>contributions during the Committee’s deliberations.
