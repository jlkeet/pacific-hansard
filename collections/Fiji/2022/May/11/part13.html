<div><span>Improvements/Renovations – Ovalau Historical Sites  
<br/>(Question No. 113/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LS. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government  inform  Parliament  when  will  the  historical  sites  in  Ovalau  undergo 
<br/>improvement and renovation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I thank the honourable Member for her question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka is of great significance to Fiji, Levuka is the first historical port 
<br/></span><span>town, first capital and the first UNESCO World Heritage Site for Fiji. There are many historical 
<br/></span><span>key  elements  in  Levuka  which  includes  the  former  Totogo  and  Nasau  Village  sites,  the  former 
<br/>Cakobau Parliament House which is now known as the European Memorial, Morris Hedstrom Bond 
<br/>Store,  the  Baba  Indentured  Labourer  Settlement,  the  Henning’s  Residence,  Capital  Robbie’s 
<br/>Bungalow,  Sacred  Heart  Cathedral,  the  Royal  Hotel,  Deed  of  Cession  site,  former  Government 
<br/>House, Post and Customs buildings together with their remnant tram  tracks to the wharf, Methodist 
<br/>Church, Levuka Public School, Town Hall, Masonic Lodge, Ovalau Club, Bowling Club, Workers 
<br/>Cottage and the Shell Button Factory site and many more.  All of which contributed to the listing 
<br/>of Levuka in 2013 as UNESCO World Heritage Site.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has been supporting the improvement and renovation of 
<br/>the historical sites in Ovalau since 2013 after the listing of Levuka as World Heritage Site. The 
<br/>improvements have been ongoing for a number of years, we have to understand that these historical 
<br/>sites  comes  under  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  Levuka  Town  Council,  other 
<br/>Government Departments, Statutory Bodies, the private owners as well and private companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2013, the Levuka Town Council has been working on a number of historical sites, for 
<br/>example, repairing and painting of the picket fencing at Nasova Deed of Cession Heritage Park, 
<br/>maintenance work at the Nasau Pavilion, renovation and repainting of the Levuka Town Hall that 
<br/>was the mammoth task because the consultants have to be brought in to scratch and get the right 
<br/>colour which used to exist hundred years ago. So that work is completed, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka Town Council are working together on the following heritage sites: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Governor’s house which is the former resident of the first Governor of Fiji, Sir Arthur 
<br/>Gordon; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of the Levuka Market, which is anticipated to cost around $2.4 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The repair works for the Governor’s house is already underway, the Levuka Town Council 
<br/>has  engaged  a  contractor  and  the  contractor  is  carrying  out  all  the  renovation  works.    Once  the 
<br/>Governor’s house is complete, Levuka Town Council intents to lease it out as a gallery and as a 
<br/>coffee shop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the famous Levuka Market, which was more than 100 years 
<br/>old, was blown away by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016.  A new and modern municipal market is being built 
<br/>by the Government for the people of Levuka and nearby islands.  The construction work is going 
<br/>on very well and we expect the construction to be completed by the end of this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016, damaged majority of the buildings, including the sea 
<br/>wall and the historical sites in Levuka.  The collapse of the sea wall resulted in the huge waves 
<br/>crushing into the Town.  The Government instantly invested $300,000 to rebuild the sea wall to 
<br/>ensure that our only heritage Town does not get further damage and lose its essence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government also injected funds to rehabilitate the heritage schools after being damaged by 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  About $2.3 million was invested into five heritage schools; Levuka Public School, 
<br/>Marist  Convent  School,  Saint  James  Anglican  School,  Delana  Methodist  Primary  School  and 
<br/>Delana Methodist Secondary School.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Heritage, with the help of Construction Implementation 
<br/>Unit (CIU), undertook a rapid damage assessment of heritage structures in Levuka after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  
<br/>The Levuka Heritage Register of Building was used as baseline for this assessment.  There was a 
<br/>need to engage the services of a lead consultant to assist in identifying and assessing each heritage 
<br/>listed building.  A report was compiled, recommending way forward for each building in accordance 
<br/>with the heritage by-laws.  The first phase of the project was mainly to asses structural and heritage 
<br/>significance of the 76 buildings which were identified by the Department of Heritage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education, along with National Trust of Fiji and Levuka Town Council, 
<br/>met with the CIU and they used the report to put in place a restoration plan for Levuka using the 
<br/>Building  Back  Better  strategy.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  preliminary  report  on  all  76  buildings  were 
<br/></span><span>received and assessed by the Ministry of Education and CIU to strategically identify buildings to 
<br/></span><span>upgrade.  Again, they had to use the report itself to work out which building will be rehabilitated 
<br/>first.  So, there was a prioritisation of these buildings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They selected two of the buildings to restore first and that are Levuka Community Hall and 
<br/>St. John Church in Cawaci.  A lead consultant, Shri Singh &amp; Associate was engaged on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> July, 
<br/>2019  for  phase  II  which  involves  full  detailed  design  documentation,  tender  and  construction 
<br/>supervision for the two buildings.  Tender for construction was advertised in April, 2022, and the 
<br/>tender was closed and the bids are currently being evaluated.  The restoration and strengthening 
<br/></span><span>works will commence by July 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has  engaged a heritage  architect,  Mr. Setoki  Tuiteci  from 
<br/>Ethos Edge, to assist in putting a plan for the foreshore area in Levuka Town, stretching from the 
<br/>Governor’s house to the War Memorial Monument.  The architect will manage the project to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that heritage guidelines are complied with and heritage look of Levuka is maintained.

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>1309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Levuka  Town  Council  and  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  have  also 
<br/>collaborated to expedite the capital works at  Levuka Town through an MOU.  This will help in 
<br/>pooling resources  together and working in  a strategic manner, rather than each institution doing 
<br/>their own thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the setback caused by several cyclones and the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry 
<br/>of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  together  with  Levuka  Town  Council  are  working  together  to 
<br/>improve and restore historical buildings, sites and monuments to maintain Levuka on UNESCO 
<br/>World Heritage List.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>the update on the heritage site in Levuka.  My question is, is your ministerial statement probably, 
<br/>in  line  with  the  survey  that  was  done  by  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human 
<br/>Rights?  I think last year, they have been touring Levuka and they made a statement there.  Is it in 
<br/>collaboration with your statement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  I  am  not  aware  of  that  statement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  so  I  cannot 
<br/>comment, unless and until you clearly tell me which statement was that.  Are you referring to the 
<br/></span><span>Standing Committee? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- If you are referring to the Standing Committee, the report they were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioning was to do with the Heritage Bill 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Police Force’s Foreign Peacekeeping Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 114/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H.R. POLITINI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update  Parliament  on  the  Fiji  Police 
<br/>Force’s foreign peacekeeping programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge and thank the 
<br/>honourable  Member  for  the  question  raised  regarding  the  Fiji  Police  Force’s  participation  in 
<br/>peacekeeping Missions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before doing so, let me acknowledge Government for a continued assistance it provides to 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force (FPF) to enable it to deploy and, of course, be supported as well in the Mission 
<br/>areas and, of course, to their families as well.  I wish to also acknowledge our men and women who 
<br/>are in Peacekeeping Missions, whether it be the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) or the 
<br/>FPF.  I wish to acknowledge all of them today and their families as well for their support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FPF’s participation in UN Peacekeeping has been ongoing since 1987 
<br/>and Fiji remains committed as one of the 90 countries contributing to UN Peacekeeping Missions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  critical  mandate  in  the  Mission  areas,  particularly  for  our  Police  Officers  include; 
<br/>providing  support  to  the  host  State  Police,  protecting  civilians,  UN  Staff  and  facilities,  whilst 
<br/>assisting with capacity building and training.  In exceptional circumstances, they are also given the 
<br/>responsibility  of  upholding  and  enforcing  the  law,  while  rebuilding  the  host  State’s  Police 
<br/>institutions.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did mention yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the first international course run at Blackrock 
<br/>was just completed on Tuesday last week and I had the opportunity to do the official closing.  It 
<br/>was two separate courses, both run online and classroom-based as well.  The two courses were on 
<br/>the protection of children and protection of civilians during conflicts and, of course, in humanitarian 
<br/>work as well.  I am thankful that places were allocated to the FPF as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had two female officers participating and two from the Fiji Corrections Service apart 
<br/>from  the  two  Australian  officers  and  the  Fijian  officers  and  Senior  NCOs  who  were  part  of  the 
<br/>course.  Currently, a total of 29 officers are serving in the following Mission areas:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMISS) – 21;  
<br/>United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) – 1; and 
<br/>United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission Sudan (UNITAMS) – 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have Police serving alongside their military comrades: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Multinational Force Observer (MFO) Sinai – 1; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), Golan Heights, Syria – 3; and 
<br/>United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) – 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  mention,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  FPF  is  in  the  process  of  preparing  for 
<br/>another United Nations Selection Assistance and Assessment Team (UNSAAT) awareness to all 
<br/>officers eligible for UN Peacekeeping Missions.  In order to fulfil the quota of having at least 25 
<br/>percent  females  in  each  contingent,  the  FPF  in  its  awareness  sessions  will  be  encouraging  the 
<br/>participation  of more women officers in  order to  qualify for deployment  in  mission areas in  the 
<br/>future as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the FPF is proud to inform this august Parliament that 
<br/>Fiji has been meeting and acceding the requirements for female officers’ participation, particularly 
<br/>for the last three years.  At the same time, I wish to again congratulate, particularly our women, the 
<br/>standard has been set by Commissioner Vuniwaqa who has moved on in her career.  She is now 
<br/>with the United Nations as Assistant Secretary-General for Safety and Security and we hope that 
<br/>more of our women, both in the military and the FPF will be given opportunities in the senior ranks 
<br/>and of course, move on to the United Nations Headquarters in New York.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may just summarise again, I have talked about the 29 deployments: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>UNMISS - 14 males and 7 females (total of 21 in Sudan); 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Libya – 1; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>MFO Sinai – 1; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Golan Heights – 3; and 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Iraq – 2 (one male and one female).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In total, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the 29, we have 21 males and 8 females.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  I wish to acknowledge the FPF, the Commissioner and the team for the excellent 
<br/>work in  preparing our men and women in  the ranks for peacekeeping missions and of course,  I 
<br/>acknowledge their families.  It is not easy to be separated for a year and I wish to acknowledge all 
<br/>their families for their support as well.

<div><span>Public Convenience Facilities - Jetties and Wharves  
<br/> (Question No. 115/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Land 
<br/>and Mineral Resources inform Parliament on the conditions and availability of public 
<br/>convenience facilities at jetties and wharves around the country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro  for  his 
<br/>question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government through the Fiji Roads Authority currently manages 
<br/>jetties around the country, which accommodate our roll-on and roll-off vessels  nationwide.  We 
<br/>have  around  10  in  the  Eastern  Division,  three  in  the  Northern  Division  and  one  in  the  Central 
<br/>Division.  And the provision of proper public convenience and waiting facilities for all these jetties 
<br/>is part of the Fiji Roads Authority Forward Works Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of these jetties operate on a daily basis, some twice a week while some have ships 
<br/>coming to them once or twice a month and also for all of these jetties, the number of passengers and 
<br/></span><span>volume of cargo and volume of vehicles varies quite considerably.  Those jetties that operate on a 
<br/></span><span>daily basis like Natovi and Nabouwalu obviously have more passengers passing through than the 
<br/>others on a weekly basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two in Natovi and Nabouwalu accommodate roll-on and roll-off vessels on a daily basis 
<br/>whilst six Savusavu, Taveuni, Vunisea, Kavala, Qarani and Koro accommodate roll-on and roll-off 
<br/>vessels  once  or  twice  a  week.    All  of  these  eight  jetties  have  public  conveniences  and  waiting 
<br/>facilities given the number of passengers passing through.  For the remaining six jetties, one has a 
<br/>public  convenience  while  the  rest  are  programmed  under  the  FRA  Forward  Works  Programme.  
<br/>That is the current status Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, who maintains the standard of these conveniences 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ensure that they subscribe to hygiene regulations that we have set and the enforcement?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.  USAMATE.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  In some of the jetties for instance in 
<br/>Nabouwalu, we have been working together with the Savusavu Local Town Council that looks after 
<br/>Nabouwalu also to help keep that clean. In other places where we do not have local councils, it is 
<br/>kept clean by the tenants by those that sell food in that area.  There is a problem sometimes with 
<br/>vandalism  for  instance  in  the  new  Kadavu  jetty,  the  Vunisea  2  not  the  old  one,  the  one  that  is 
<br/>currently  being  used  as  soon  as  it  was  fixed  up,  one  of  the  plumbing  got  ripped  out,  things 
<br/>disappeared from there so we do have that particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the kind of discussions we had with places like Nabouwalu to work together with 
<br/>Savusavu Town Council is a model that we hope to replicate.  Nabouwalu is also a growing area, 
<br/>so we are also working with the Director of Town and Country Planning because Nabouwalu is one 
<br/>of the three jetties that we are targeting to replace - Nabouwalu, Natovi and Savusavu.  And as part 
<br/>of that to develop that whole facility to improve the convenience that we have for people that use 
<br/>them.  That is the focus and it is going to take some time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the programmes that we have here for the nine major jetties that we are looking to 
<br/>upgrade namely, Nabouwalu, Savusavu, Natovi, Moala, Lomaloma, Koro, Vunisea 2, Makogai and 
<br/>Nabukeru all of these are now under investigation and the planned improvement will also include 
<br/>essential  public  convenience  facilities  such  as  parking,  waiting  shelter  with  rest  rooms  and 
<br/>stakeholder offices.  But the physical construction will probably commence in two years’ time and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>last for the next five years.  So, they are programming but we hope to be able to establish and put 
<br/>them in place gradually over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  thank  the  Minister  for  the  brief 
<br/>explanation in regard to all these jetties and wharves all over Fiji but my concern is in 2020, I asked 
<br/>the Minister with regards to Vunisea and Naleca, Kavala Bay.  I think honourable Faiyaz Koya is 
<br/>giving the MSMEs in these jetties, they have businesses over there selling food and they have been 
<br/>given the licence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The conditions at Vunisea and Kavala has been deplorable and the toilets and place for them 
<br/>to visit is out of place.  I think </span><span>TC Harold</span><span> damaged it and two years later nothing has been done 
<br/>about it.  In Kavala, the resting place for passengers, there is a…..  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- </span><span>Wawa! Wawa!</span><span> See that is the problem with you people when we try 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to give you positive criticism, constructive criticism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are against it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, supplementary question - perhaps you might like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>enlighten Parliament on what happened in Vunisea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- When are you going to fix the Vunisea and Naleca Jetty because it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been two years now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thought the honourable Minister had already answered that but I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>give him the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The Vunisea Jetty has a waiting shed and it has a  public convenience.  
<br/>As I mentioned before we went there late last year that place had just been fixed up but then it got 
<br/>vandalised, the lights disappeared.   You know the Vunisea Jetty is away from the main area so that 
<br/>is an issue that we have. We had some discussions with the people in Namalata or Namuana - some 
<br/>of the people there sell food in that area so we want to have an arrangement where they also look 
<br/>after that facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the plans to upgrade Vunisea is for the year 2023/2024.  For Naleca Jetty in Kavala you 
<br/>know that we have a public convenience there, a waiting shed and water supply.  We know that the 
<br/>solar lights were damaged during </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>.  We also have plans to upgrade it in the financial year 
<br/>2023/2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Last supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- A supplementary question to the honourable Minister, can you 
<br/>assure this Parliament that the future plans for upgrade will also accommodate the needs of travellers 
<br/>with disabilities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I think this Government has a record of looking after people that are 
<br/>physically  challenged.  We  brought  the  legislation  into  this  Parliament.  We  were  the  one  that 
<br/>introduced the allowances under Social Welfare for the Disabled and if there is one Government 
<br/>that  will  always  look  after  all  the  people  in  this  country,  physically  challenged  or  not,  it  is  this 
<br/>Government.  We will definitely make sure that we do that.

<br/>Speaker, Sir, but before that, I just want to respond to a comment made by honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad, that we are juvenile.  It is a condescending remark and it does not befit a person who wants 
<br/>to become a deputy Prime Minister or Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  turmeric  is  now  a  very  important  commodity  for  Fiji  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>agricultural export sector.  It is globally used for medicinal purposes and it is widely used in Fiji as 
<br/>well for herbal medicine.  It has a distinctive taste and aroma on food.  It has high curcumin content 
<br/>which has been clinically proven to fight against some of the ailments.  This important characteristic 
<br/></span><span>of turmeric contributes to its ever increasing demand in the international market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Fiji,  turmeric  at  the  moment  grows  wildly,  Mr.  Speaker,  in  the  highlands  of  Tailevu, 
<br/>Navosa, Nadi and the Northern Division.  So all the turmeric at the moment that is being harvested 
<br/>and exported is wildly-grown turmeric.  Now, noting the importance of turmeric and the growing 
<br/>share in the export market where we exported last year $22.9 million worth of turmeric.  We now 
<br/>want  to  expand  turmeric  production  but  maintain  the  brand  image  that  it  is  organically-grown 
<br/>turmeric, meaning we do not want to utilise any fertiliser or chemical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this turmeric that we exported in 2021 where we exported 2300 tonnes, it 
<br/>grew from 74 tonnes in 2013 so we can see how the turmeric market sent a signal and resulted in 
<br/>harvesting and supply, so we now want  to  ensure that we maintain that production base, in  fact 
<br/>expand the production base so that we can expand and get more export income into the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For turmeric, our main export destinations are U.S., New Zealand, Australia and Canada but 
<br/>most  of  it  goes  to  the  U.S.  market.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  we  are  doing  is,  we  have  now 
<br/>allocated for the first time ever in this financial year’s budget a specific allocation under ‘spices’ of 
<br/>$100,000 to expand turmeric production.  So as of today we have got 27.4 acres of planted turmeric 
<br/>on the ground.  We supported with planting material, land preparation and organic agro inputs to 
<br/>the farmers and clearly articulated to them that they need to ensure that it is organic turmeric so that 
<br/>we can maintain the brand image.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at expanding turmeric in Kadavu as well.  There has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interest from Kadavu.  There has been interest from Koro Island as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Central  Division  too,  we  have  seen  new  farmers  coming  forward  asking  to  grow 
<br/>turmeric and we are expanding this and we want to raise the export earnings from the current $22 
<br/>million.  We are targeting turmeric progressively alongside kava possibly as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of interest and we are taking advantage of the interest from 
<br/>the farmers and we have got exporters who are operating from the Western Division and they are 
<br/>basically saying that we are not getting the full demand that we want to from the export market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the Minister for his brief on turmeric.  In the

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlands of Navosa, turmeric is in plentiful supply and I believe it is rated very highly.  Also, in 
<br/>Navosa is the Vatumali Centre, which has a collection centre.  Would the Government, the Minister 
<br/>consider using one of those centres to be a processing area to generate employment to the people of 
<br/>that area for their turmeric?  They already have a collection centre, Mr. Speaker, so I just wonder if 
<br/>Government  can  consider  setting  up  processing  in  those  centres  where  turmeric  is  in  plentiful 
<br/>supply.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  moment  the  exporters  are  going  and 
<br/>collecting the turmeric from the farmers at Keiyasi in the interior. So  it is totally private sector-
<br/>driven.  We are a facilitator and we assist the farmers and the farmers only.  So if exporters want to 
<br/>come and establish a processing centre closer to the farmers then we are happy to facilitate that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  A supplementary question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister; can the honourable Minister advise this Parliament what form of assistance 
<br/>can the Ministry of Agriculture give to those who intend to commence turmeric farming or those 
<br/>new turmeric farmers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I mentioned that in my earlier response. 
<br/></span><span>The amount of $100,000 has been allocated to support farmers in terms of land preparation, in terms 
<br/></span><span>of provision of planting material and agro inputs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA</span><span>.-  </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  would like to  thank the honourable Minister.  
<br/>You have mentioned that the Eastern Division – Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau and Rotuma are interested 
<br/>in planting turmeric and this morning in your Ministerial Statement, you talked about the ginger.  
<br/>In this interest, can you give us a date when you will be implementing that in the Eastern Division, 
<br/>especially Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau and Rotuma? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have advertised our assistance in August after 
<br/>the new financial year started and we have some interest recently from Koro.  Our officers on the 
<br/>ground in Kadavu have said that there are some interest and we are rolling out the programme.  We 
<br/>are getting close to this financial year so I think the next lot of assistance for turmeric would come 
<br/>from August when the new budget kicks in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance to the Rehabilitation of Pine Access Roads  
<br/>(Question No. 117/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  inform  Parliament  of  any  assistance  it 
<br/>provides towards the rehabilitation of pine access roads in the rural and maritime areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>the question and, of course, I wish to thank you as well, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to answer 
<br/>this  question  as  discussed  during  the  Business  Committee  meeting  because  it  involves  our 
<br/>communities  in  the  rural  and  maritime  areas  and  we  are  particularly  under  the  Integrated  Rural 
<br/>Development  Framework,  we  do  a  lot  of  coordination  on  behalf  of  the  communities  with  the 
<br/>agencies responsible and ‘road’ is high in that agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On pine access  roads specifically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the Ministry of Forests, we 
<br/>have Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Pine Trust.  I leave that to what the Ministry of Rural Development 
<br/>does and what the Fiji Roads Authority does as well particularly when communities who live in the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pine leases, so to speak or are adjacent or live within the area and have assistance through the various 
<br/>machineries available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the code of logging practice given to contractors, probably I will start 
<br/>here roading is part of that.  While the licence is valid, it is their responsibility to cut the access 
<br/>roads and to maintain that during the activities that they undertake in the area and that is how some 
<br/>of the communities involved have roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Pine Trust is given $0.7 million annually to assist all pine areas under the 49 Pine 
<br/>Schemes and this includes those in the maritime areas.  These Pine Schemes are managed by the 
<br/>Fiji  Pine  Trust  to  support  growing  and  replanting  of  pine  within  the  Schemes,  as  well  as  the 
<br/>associated administrative cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while they are replanting as part of the administrative costs, the roading is 
<br/>covered under that as well and that is how we have come to have existing roads particularly under 
<br/>the schemes with the Fiji Pine Trust.  Of course, we have Fiji Pine Limited and most of the land are 
<br/>under the Fiji Pine Limited and this is perhaps the more sensitive one out of the three because of 
<br/>the leases involved, particularly from the Ministry of Rural Development and Communities do need 
<br/></span><span>that assistance on roads that pass through Fiji Pine Limited leases we do the facilitation on behalf 
<br/></span><span>of the communities to Fiji Pine Limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just spoke to the Operations Manager at Lololo because 
<br/>of a request from Nalotawa in the interior of Ba about their roads (the one coming from Lololo to 
<br/>Nalotawa) because most of these pass through the leases owned by Fiji Pine Limited. Therefore, in 
<br/>some instances, when Fiji Pine is not in a position to assist as before, they used to have a roading 
<br/>unit initially but now they no longer have the roading unit but they still look after some of the roads 
<br/>and the costing mechanism that they use is about $1.50 per tonne.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You can see that it is very minimal given the cost of infrastructure maintenance that we see 
<br/>these days. That is how they work out the costs and sometimes when it is beyond them, they seek 
<br/>the  assistance  of  other  agencies  and  that  is  where  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  plays  an 
<br/>important role in facilitating the request from the community, with Fiji Pine and when Fiji Pine 
<br/>Limited is not in a position to assist, then we will ask Fiji Roads Authority (FRA).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FRA has an annual allocation of about $50 million dollars particularly for rural areas 
<br/>but  that  has  its  priority  list  as  well  that  we  agreed  together  every  year.    The  four  Divisional 
<br/>Commissioners, through the Ministry of Rural Development, but sometimes we have to reprioritise 
<br/>based  on  the  needs  and  that  is  where  requests  particularly  for  roads  that  pass  through  Fiji  Pine 
<br/>Leases are facilitated and prioritised. That is how roads are maintained in the rural and maritime 
<br/>Pine Schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, from the Ministry of Rural Development and FRA, because some 
<br/>of  the  roadings  that  exists  in  rural  Fiji  were  constructed  when  we  had  projects  under  these 
<br/>programmes - the Cocoa project, Dairy project, Pine project, Mahogany project, that is how most 
<br/>of the rural roads came into existence and in the clarification of roads, it is still existing today. We 
<br/>have  pine  access  roads,  mahogany  access  roads,  sugarcane  access  roads,  non-sugarcane  access 
<br/>roads and then we have rural access roads. Then we have, what we used to call as PWD standards 
<br/>and the national roads which are all under FRA’s jurisdiction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very  briefly,  the  allocation  for  farm  roads  particularly  non-cane  access  is  given  to  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture, the cane-access roads is given to the Ministry of Sugar and we have about 
<br/>$2  million  allocation  under  what  we  call  the  cuff  project,  community  access,  rural  roads  and

<div><span>footbridges and footpaths. That is how we deal with some and $50 million is with FRA on rural 
<br/>roads so that is the process and that is how the roads in the maritime pine schemes are facilitated.

<div><span>Update and Preventative Measures – Lymphatic Filariasis 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 118/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lymphatic Filariasis and what preventative measures have been taken to eliminate it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- I thank the honourable Member for that question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Lymphatic Filariasis or sometimes called the Elephantiasis is caused 
<br/>by nematodes and globally there is about more than 860 million people in 47 countries worldwide 
<br/>that are threatened by Lymphatic Filariasis.  They require medicines to prevent it or preventative 
<br/>chemotherapy or chemoprevention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  labelled  as  a  neglected  tropical  disease  and  more  than  8  billion 
<br/></span><span>cumulative treatments have been delivered to stop the spread of infection since 2000.  In Fiji, the 
<br/>Lymphatic  Filariasis  Programme  has  been  around  for  21  years.    It  has  been  based  on  the 
<br/>collaboration that we have with WHO to achieve the global target of elimination which was set at 
<br/>less than 1 percent prevalence in the population by 2020, however, WHO has reset its target to 2030 
<br/>and there are many countries that have not met it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Fiji,  we have noted there is  a particular province only which has more  than 1 percent 
<br/>prevalence.    Fiji  as  a  member  of  the  22  Pacific  Island  countries  under  the  Pacific  Elimination 
<br/>Lymphatic  Filariasis  umbrella  continues  all  its  journey  to  combat  Filariasis  and  here  towards 
<br/>meeting the elimination goal.  As we all know, with this problem it can cause disability, disabling 
<br/>and disfiguration also. Mass Drug Administration is one of the Programmes main strategic pillars 
<br/>and in interruption of Lymphatic Filariasis transmission from 2002 to 2007.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have actively implemented Mass Drug Administration grounds, followed by surveys to 
<br/>check  our  prevalence.    Our  aim  is  to  decrease  our  national  prevalence  rate  and  this  was  widely 
<br/>reflected in the drop of its prevalence rate from 16 percent in 2002 to 9 percent by 2007.  In 2010, 
<br/>a divisional specific strategy was implemented, targeting specific issues within the four divisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Central Division underwent eight rounds of multi drug administration.  Based on the 
<br/>second transmission assessment survey in the year 2017, the prevalence rate remains in the Central 
<br/>Division less than 1 percent with only a hotspot in Serua. The Central Division is scheduled for a 
<br/>third transmission assessment survey in the coming months.  This will determine whether we need 
<br/>to do a MDA in the Central Division next year or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Western Division has passed three of their transmission assessment 
<br/>surveys  and  has  maintained  the  less  than  1  percent  prevalence  except  for  Malolo.    The  Eastern 
<br/>Division have to start with their first transmission assessment survey, to do the high prevalence rate.  
<br/>The division must schedule for two rounds of MDA between 2020 and 2021.  This was due to 2019 
<br/>Central survey results of about 7 percent prevalence.  The first round was implemented in 2020, 
<br/>second round was in 2021, however, the COVID-19 restrictions put in place in the second outbreak 
<br/>has pushed the second round to August, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1317 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The Northern Division has implemented three rounds of the transmission assessment survey.  
<br/>The first two rounds of the survey maintained the threshold of below 1 percent which was in 2013 
<br/>and 2015, whereas the third round in 2018 showed up a prevalence rate of more than 1 percent in 
<br/>the  Northern  Division.  This  indicates  that  Northern  Division  has  not  achieved  its  objective  of 
<br/>reducing the level of microfilaria in the endemic population to an extent where transmission is likely 
<br/>to reoccur in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, two rounds of MDA for Lymphatic Filariasis were required in 
<br/>the Northern Division in 2019 to 2020. The first round which was done in collaboration with the 
<br/>Scabies Project also to eliminate scabies called the Big SHIFT Project on the research going on with 
<br/>it, was implemented in July to August 2019 with the good MDA coverage of more than 80 percent 
<br/>in Vanua Levu.  The second round of MDA was scheduled to take place in July to August 2020 but 
<br/>due to the pandemic it has been postponed and we are hoping to do it within the next few weeks.

<div><span>Dredging Plan – Waidamu River 
<br/>(Question No. 119/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on its dredging plan at the Waidamu River in the district of Bau? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Waidamu River, along with another 109 rivers 
<br/>and creeks, were advertised to be desilted or dredged a number of times.  We were successful in 
<br/>getting  under  the  PPP  model,  where  the  Ministry  will  undertake  the  scoping,  the  drawing  of 
<br/>extraction and develop the environmental management plan for the extraction at our cost, and will 
<br/>work with the land owners to get the fishing rights waiver, and awarded to a contractor who would 
<br/>extract that material, pay the royalty and then take the material and sell it and keep the profits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of these 110 rivers and creeks, for 31 rivers and creeks, we were able to successfully 
<br/>get contractors to undertake the desilting work on a PPP model.  The Waidamu River is a long river 
<br/>of 9.6 kilometres and has a total volume silt of 127,518 which needs to be removed, it is a massive 
<br/>amount of silt that needs to be removed and the river mouth as well to be cleared, so it is entire 9.6 
<br/>kilometres that needs to be cleared.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We advertised four times, just to update Parliament.  Normally, the interest from contractors 
<br/>come if there are lots of gravel and sand materials.  No one is after the silt, which they cannot sell 
<br/>and get money.  Waidamu River has very little gravel and sand but more silt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, fourth time, we were able to get a company, that company took us for a 
<br/>ride for about six months, even went and commissioned et cetera, but they we were not able to get 
<br/>the dredger and do the dredging.  So, we cancelled the agreement and then we advertised again, and 
<br/>we were able to get another company called Hardrock Dredging Company, just before COVID-19.  
<br/>They got their brand new dredger, went there and started the dredging work, and there were some 
<br/>issues with the community, there were some physical scuffle and some of their staffs got hurt, they 
<br/>stopped it and then COVID-19  came. So, we went  and settled the issue and they were about  to 
<br/>resume when COVID-19 came and their workers went back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When COVID-19 started to ease out, we were expecting their workers to come back.  That 
<br/>is  where  we  are  now,  we  are  not  able  to  get  the  company  to  start  the  dredging  works.    In  the 
<br/>meantime, we are looking at other contractors to give out parts of the river so that we can fast track 
<br/>while we wait for this particular contractor.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to assure Parliament that Waidamu River is right on the top of our agenda in terms 
<br/>of  dredging,  and  we  are  mindful  of  the  spill  over  effect  of  Waidamu  River  on  the  nearby 
<br/>communities.  The worse scenario is, we are expecting our own dredger to come at the end of the 
<br/>year, donated by the Government of Japan, thanks to the Government of Japan, and then we can get 
<br/>the dredger there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have some emergency rivers in the Northern Division but we are not able to find 
<br/>any dredging company.  So we need to engage our dredgers in areas or rivers where we do not get 
<br/>interest from the private sector.  But we have good news that as we speak, we have got dredging in 
<br/>Ba River which is a bit slow, dredging is happening in the Nasivi River in Tavua, so we are making 
<br/>good progress with the private sector model, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his response.  All those 32 river dredging, do they have credible EIAs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  just  explained  that  EIA  needs  to  be 
<br/>undertaken when you are interfering with the natural course of the river waterway.  When you are 
<br/>restoring the river or creek to its original state, then we undertake an Environmental Management 
<br/></span><span>Plan (EMP) where we guide the contractor on how they need to undertake the extraction work, how 
<br/></span><span>many metres from the left riverbank, how many metres from the right riverbank, the exact amount 
<br/>of silt that needs to be removed, so they cannot remove anything more than that.  Those are captured 
<br/>when  our  engineers  go  and  do  the  actual  survey  of  the  river,  do  the  drawings,  and  then  an 
<br/>Environmental Officer develops the EMP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is done by the Ministry of Waterways.  The EMP is then submitted to 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Environment,  so  they  are  two  different  Ministries.    Once  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Environment clears, then that entire thing is taken to the Ministry of Lands and it is the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands  that  gives  the  licence  for  extraction,  not  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  or  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Environment.

<div><span>FNU-Monash University Joint Pacific Island Countries Climate Change Research Centre 
<br/>(Question No. 120/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the  Fiji 
<br/>National  University-Monash  University  Joint  Pacific  Island  Countries  Climate  Change 
<br/>Research Centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  by  way  of  background,  the  combination  of  environmental, 
<br/>technological and political threats that we face today is, indeed, unprecedented.  We know through 
<br/>excerpts of the reports by reputable organisations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
<br/>Change  (IPCC),  that  average  global  temperature  rise  of  a  staggering  3.1  Degree  Celsius  is  just 
<br/>around the corner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If global emissions are not reduced by 43 percent in the next eight years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the  1.5  Degree  Celsius  threshold  that  Pacific  Island  Countries  have  been  pushing  for,  which  is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>imperative for securing the possibility of a safe future for Pacific Islands will become an impossible 
<br/>aspiration because we know that countries like Tuvalu, their highest pitch above sea level is 12 feet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  rise  in  the  global  average  temperature  of  over  3.0  Degrees  Celsius  will  mean 
<br/>unprecedented sea level rise, and the rise in temperatures across the Pacific equatorial regions of 
<br/>the Earth of a magnitude that would make life untenable for many and most island nations.  Already 
<br/>in Fiji, we have identified 43 Villages that need to be moved to higher ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to mitigate both, the staggering risks and prepare for the impacts 
<br/>that will actually occur, irrespective of the scale of global emission reduction achieved over the next 
<br/>decade,  we  need  to  develop  solutions.   We  need  to  participate  actively  in  the  science,  research, 
<br/>innovation,  the legal issues and inquiry that will help  define solutions  that suit our context  and, 
<br/>indeed, our needs, Sir. The basis of policies we create plan and put in place must be shaped by the 
<br/>evidence and the depth of analysis that helps to ensure we create answers to the right questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as  highlighted by the honourable Member, we made significant  strides 
<br/>against the evidence-based approach of our National Climate Change Policy through the launch of 
<br/>the MOU between Monash University, one of the top universities not just in Australia but in the 
<br/></span><span>world, and the Fiji National University.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU which was signed last week sets out the basis for progressive and joint Monash 
<br/>and  FNU  Pacific  Island  Countries  (PICs)  Climate  Change  Research  Centre  (CCRC).    This  is  a 
<br/>partnership  which  will  further  complement  the  efforts  of  the  existing  research  pursuits  and 
<br/>institutions in the region while helping to advance the knowledge and information we need to better 
<br/>confront the evolving climate crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what this partnership does is that it will be led by a group of experts and 
<br/>experience from the Pacific Islands ensuring this work is grounded in the context and challenges 
<br/>we seek to address.  We are also very glad that Professor Paresh Narayan who originally is from 
<br/>Navua and who is a gold medallist from Monash University in one of the top 500 cited econometrics 
<br/>in Australia and indeed globally is the one who in fact brought this proposal to FNU.  We are very 
<br/>glad that someone of his ilk is actually leading this particular charge and the Monash University 
<br/>obviously has a lot of confidence in him and therefore we are able to set up this Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There will be a Director that will be funded by the Monash University who will be based at 
<br/>FNU.  Once the Director is appointed, he or she will be tasked with developing a five-year strategy.  
<br/>Membership  of  other  Pacific  Island  countries  will  be  pursued  and  a  business  plan  for  the 
<br/>implementation of the Centre will be developed which will strive to create a competitive research 
<br/>programme equipped with the network and resources needed to both retain local experts by also 
<br/>attracting international research partnerships. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Indeed, as we mentioned, I suppose one of the positive things out of being at the cold phase 
<br/>of climate change is that many people would like to be based in a country that is at the cold phase 
<br/>of climate change to be able to carry out that research.  The two universities have already undertaken 
<br/>a  mapping  of  the  internal  capabilities  on  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  April,  2022  this  year,  five  Monash  University 
<br/>Professors and the 10 FNU Academics attended a research boot camp at FNU Nasinu Campus.  At 
<br/>the boot camp, three collaborative seed projects aligned to climate change mitigation were put in 
<br/>place and mental health, forestry and energy were identified  - FNU and Monash University will 
<br/>fund these projects using internal research funding mechanisms.  They intend to use this pilot work 
<br/>in the pursuit of future donors sponsor funding in the field.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  highlighted,  the  world’s  leading  expertise  provided  by  Monash  University  and  its 
<br/>renowned role in progressing climate change research and education, the Pacific will have a greater 
<br/>access to tuition and knowledge needed to train and create the next generation of researchers and 
<br/>climate change risk management specialists needed to support regional adaptation efforts, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  but  not  the  least,  this  partnership  also  is  closely  aligned  with  the  objectives  and 
<br/>requirements set out by our own Fijian, recently approved by Parliament, Climate Change Act.  The 
<br/>Act  requires  national  education  programmes  and  curriculums  to  include  knowledge  transfer  on 
<br/>climate change to advance learning that helps us to create the skill-sets and workforce that will help 
<br/>define Fiji’s future.  As highlighted yesterday, even many of the Members, in particular on the other 
<br/>side, do not feature or factor climate change in their discourse or discussions or perhaps, hopefully, 
<br/>they will include in their manifestos that climate change is critically important to be able to have 
<br/>that taken into account, even when developing very simple policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Climate Change Act (which I hope they will look at) is also a framework and signal for 
<br/>new economic approach in which the protection and preservation of nature is actually valid.  The 
<br/>Act sets out the legal basis for ensuring that the stewardship of and protection of the environment 
<br/>can be translated into jobs and careers.  It calls for national energy sector built and maintained by 
<br/></span><span>solar engineers and a sustainable tourism sector that is inter-woven with  our environment’s best 
<br/></span><span>interests, things like, for example, the solar institute that has been setup in Vanua Levu where we 
<br/>are  bringing  in  women,  grandmothers  and  mothers  from  all  over  Fiji,  providing  hostel 
<br/>accommodation and they actually become trained engineers in maintaining solar systems that will 
<br/>be put up – the Barefoot College. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very excited about this MOU and we are very excited about the 
<br/>fact  that we have an internationally recognised  university that is  collaborating with  our national 
<br/>university.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members that brings an end to Question time.  The hour being 
<br/>late at this time, I just want to remind the Commonwealth Women’s Parliamentary Fiji Group of
