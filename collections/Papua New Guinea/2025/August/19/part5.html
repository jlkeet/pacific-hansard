<p>MINISTRY OF TREASURY —- ECONOMIC UPDATE ON IMPLEMENTING THE</p>
<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY (Kavieng -Minister for Treasury) — Mr Acting Speaker,</p>
<p>the Marape/Rosso Government is an open and transparent government. This means keeping</p>
<p>our Parliament and our people informed of key economic developments. I am pleased to</p>
<p>provide another economic update this afternoon. There are many economic issues facing our</p>
<p>country and time is short and I will focus on key international budget and inflation issues since</p>
<p>the 2023 Budget Statement.</p>
<p>On an international update, Mr Acting Speaker, the international outlook at the time of</p>
<p>the 2023 budget was gloomy and uncertain. As expected, the World Bank’s January economic</p>
<p>outlook documents slashed its global growth outlook from three to one -</p>
<p>11/01</p>
<p>The World Bank, January economic outlook document, slashed its global growth</p>
<p>outlook from 3 to 1.7 per cent for this year. This is the third worst growth performance in the</p>
<p>world economy in the last 30 years. And 2020 was also one of the three worst years. The world</p>
<p>bank estimates growth in PNG will be .8 of a per cent less in 2022 and 2023 this year and</p>
<p>forecast just six months ago.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had built much of this into our growth forecasts and as previously stated</p>
<p>our Papua New Guinea economy is doing so much better than most other countries. Indeed,</p>
<p>the new World Bank forecast for PNG of real growth of 3.5 per cent is still more than double</p>
<p>the world average. Despite this bad global news there is no need to panic. The Marape</p>
<p>Government was able to steer our country’s economy through the dangers of the COVID-19</p>
<p>pandemic. Papua New Guinea will weather the latest storm much better than most other</p>
<p>countries. And once again we will be responsive, responsible and caring.</p>
<p>On our 2023 Budget Implementation status PNG’s financial accounts for 2023 opened</p>
<p>on January 9"" 2023. Now it is time to implement our historic 2023 Budget. This year we will</p>
<p>see the highest level of government expenditure in our country’s history K24,567 million all</p>
<p>of this within a responsible program of budget repair and reconstruction which will see Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea return to a budget surplus target date of 2027 and the start of reducing our</p>
<p>country’s debt.</p>
<p>Let me highlight some key expenditure priorities as we implement the PANGU</p>
<p>platform from the 2022 Election. Infrastructure expenditure will increase from K4668 million</p>
<p>Page 18:</p>
<p>in 2018 to K9796 million this year more than double. This is also being delivered with more</p>
<p>local content and more local job opportunities. Within that capital budget of K9796 million,</p>
<p>PNG’s Public Investment Program or PIP component has increased from K2041 million in</p>
<p>2018 to K6615 million this year as I mentioned a little earlier during question time.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary increase of over 220 per cent. The Marape/Rosso Government</p>
<p>is the infrastructure government. Responsible investments in physical capital to support growth</p>
<p>in our economy. We are also supporting major increases in human capital spending. Our health</p>
<p>funding will reach K2311 million this year, a 34 per cent increase since 2021. Education will</p>
<p>receive K1650 million, a 51 per cent increase from 2021.</p>
<p>Law and justice will reach K1,787 million, a 41 per cent increase from 2021 and this is</p>
<p>supporting the police recruitment campaign, wasn’t it great...</p>
<p>12/01</p>
<p>This is supporting the police recruitment campaign. Wasn’t it great to see so many of</p>
<p>our young people applying in January this year, over 80 000 applicants.</p>
<p>We have committed increased salary funding for a steady five percent increase in the</p>
<p>numbers of teachers, doctors and nurses through to 2027 and then a 10 percent increase each</p>
<p>year after that. Just have a look at our 13-years plan, making sure that our new schools and</p>
<p>hospitals will have the necessary stuff.</p>
<p>The economic sector will receive K989 million a 46 percent increase from 2021 witha</p>
<p>much greater focus on supporting our farmers and agriculture and SMEs.</p>
<p>Funding for provinces will increase from K50138 a 30 percent increase from 2021,</p>
<p>giving our good governors more resources to implement their key activities at the decentralised</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>The major challenge for the 2023 Budget is now ensuring that this record level of</p>
<p>funding is spent well and benefits our people. There is much hard work ahead for all of us to</p>
<p>ensure that this occur.</p>
<p>The 2023 Budget is being delivered with a Budget repair of a K1 billion reduction in</p>
<p>the deficit.</p>
<p>A low-cost financing strategy which has lowered debt interest costs from 6.5 percent to</p>
<p>4.2 percent, thereby generating interest, cost savings of K1353 million in 2023 alone.      All</p>
<p>in the context of a tough global environment, with many countries expected to fall into</p>
<p>recession whilst, PNG grows at double the world rate.</p>
<p>Page 19:</p>
<p>Our country is doing better than most, because of the good economic policies of the</p>
<p>Marape/Rosso Government, guided by the Pangu Party vision of leaving no district or person</p>
<p>behind. Do not believe the lies of social media or some of those sitting on the other side.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the 2023 Household assistance package, despite the good economic</p>
<p>news looking forward, we must remember that PNG has frankly some of the worst social</p>
<p>indicators in the region. Too much poverty, and living standards for most of our people are</p>
<p>simply not high enough. This Government knows the cost-of-living pressures faced by families</p>
<p>around the nation and for the first time in PNG history, the Marape/Rosso Government</p>
<p>developed a package to help some of those pressures with a K587 million in 2022 and K590</p>
<p>million in 2023. A total of K1177million in assistance to our households and our people. No</p>
<p>other Government has ever delivered such a household assistance package.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I am pleased that he IRC has written to all employers with new tax</p>
<p>schedules applied from the 1* of January 2023. This is providing tax cuts of up to K63 per</p>
<p>fortnight for all those earning K20 000.00 or more for 2023.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the dailies our NASFUND estimates will benefit over 98 per cent of</p>
<p>their members.</p>
<p>13/01</p>
<p>Most of them in the younger age group. From the 1“ of January this year we are also</p>
<p>continuing for another six months the removal of all excised taxes on fuel. This will save 61</p>
<p>toea per litre of petrol costs and 23 toea per litre of diesel costs. From the 1* of January this</p>
<p>year we are also covering the cost of social project fees in 2023. For example, a family no</p>
<p>longer has to pay the project fee of K220 for each children attending secondary schools. This</p>
<p>program helps ensure that relief gets out to the furthest parts of our country. The cost of living</p>
<p>relief is greatest for those most in need. Those families with the most mouths to feed while</p>
<p>letting their children attend school rather than work in the gardens.</p>
<p>Responsible, caring, budgeting the Marape/Rosso Government supporting families in</p>
<p>ways never before experienced in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>On inflation, the National Statistics Office (NSO) has released its estimates of inflation</p>
<p>for the September quarter of 2022. The NSO estimates inflation of those three months was 1</p>
<p>per cent, this is half the inflation rate of 2 per cent for the three months of the June quarter of</p>
<p>2022.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the Government keeps a very close eye on inflation. It knows that</p>
<p>some key items have had very high price increases. This is why we introduced a 1177 million</p>
<p>Page 20:</p>
<p>household assistance to help deal with some of these costs of living pressures. The good news</p>
<p>is that the overall current level of inflation of 6.3 per cent is below PNG’s long term average</p>
<p>rate of 7 per cent. The Treasury and the Central Bank along with the international institutions</p>
<p>are predicting the inflation rate will be below 6 per cent this year and fall towards 5 per cent</p>
<p>next year.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, this means that we are not expecting high inflation this year. Once</p>
<p>again, beware the funded scab campaigned by social media and the so called PNG empty tank.</p>
<p>These inflation figures are gathered by the NSO across many areas of the country and go into</p>
<p>detail on over 120 items and services. As a responsible government we will continue to closely</p>
<p>monitor inflation levels. If things get worse, we will look at options to do more within the</p>
<p>context of sustainable budget repair.</p>
<p>Our international engagement, Mr Acting Speaker, one of the great strengths of the</p>
<p>Marape/Rosso Government is its willingness to engage constructively and honestly with the</p>
<p>international community. I have had the honor to have had three good discussions with</p>
<p>Australian Treasurer Jim Charmers already in 2022 and 2023. These discussions include shared</p>
<p>economic and trade opportunities such as labor mobility and good cheap financing options.</p>
<p>On the international monetary fund program, Mr Acting Speaker, I am pleased to</p>
<p>foreshadow to this Parliament that PNG stands ready to enter into a funded program with the</p>
<p>international monetary fund or the IMF. Our first program in nearly 20 years. We commenced</p>
<p>this partnership back in 2019. We knew the IMF were critical for restoring international</p>
<p>confidence in PNG’s economic management. We saw then as a source transparency and</p>
<p>14/01</p>
<p>We knew the IMF were critical, for restoring international confidence, in PNG’s</p>
<p>economic management. We saw them, as a source of transparency and expertise. This</p>
<p>engagement, was also important, for the K1.2 billion, in cheap funding they provided to us in</p>
<p>2020, to deal with the then 20 per cent fall in our revenues, due to the COVID-19 pandemics.</p>
<p>All countries were also assisted by the IFM, with an increase in quotas in 2021. We now</p>
<p>stand ready, To engage in a program, that will likely contribute K310 million or possibly K614</p>
<p>million this year, to support our Budget repair, and a total of up to K3,250 million over the next</p>
<p>three years.</p>
<p>Importantly, agreement to this program, is also vital for securing support from other</p>
<p>countries. Without a program, Australian legislation would require the K1,800 million we</p>
<p>received just in December last year, actually having to be repaid now and little prospects, of</p>
<p>Page 21:</p>
<p>success, for the request of K1,500 million this year reflected in our financing plan. We will</p>
<p>also approach Japan and other partners, including the World Bank, ADB, for support and they</p>
<p>are all linked, to the IMF program. The alternative to this of course, is going back to expensive</p>
<p>commercial loans and of course being able to borrow significant the less than what we are</p>
<p>currently doing today.</p>
<p>The guiding principle for engaging with the IMF, has been support for the Marape/Rosso</p>
<p>Government’s economic reform program. The IMF are extremely satisfied, with our program</p>
<p>of economic repair and reconstruction. They are also pleased, with the progress we have been</p>
<p>making on good governance reforms, especially those around the Independent Commission</p>
<p>Against Corruption.</p>
<p>They are keeping us honest, pushing our institutions, to release more transparent</p>
<p>procurement data. They also working closely with us, on reform of our monetary and foreign</p>
<p>exchange rate practices. We are sure, they will welcome and respect, our own local expertise,</p>
<p>provided through PNG’s own Independent Advisory Group, on BPNG reform. There have been</p>
<p>hiccups along the road, yes and I expect, there will be hiccups in the future. Overall, however,</p>
<p>it has been a productive partnership. And we must on occasions, take a hard-headed approach</p>
<p>to our national interests, including linked funding support. Like all negotiations, this will</p>
<p>require some give and take, on both sides.</p>
<p>At the end of this statement, members of Parliament, I have attached details on the</p>
<p>program for this Parliament. This covers the details of the loan terms and expected</p>
<p>disbursement schedule. It includes all of the quantitative and qualitative conditions, for the first</p>
<p>12 months, we have 18 of those and this is part of our rolling three-year program. I will continue</p>
<p>to provide regular updates to the IMF on this IMF program, including any updated conditions.</p>
<p>And I welcome Parliamentarians to a briefing at our Treasury to go through the program and</p>
<p>would hope we can organize a broader meeting with the IMF with those of you that have time</p>
<p>and might be interested during their next visit. So, I commend this program to the House.</p>
<p>For good health in 2023, Mr Acting Speaker, at this time, I must also note, the tremendous</p>
<p>loss to the country, of the sudden death of Sir Wilson Kamit.</p>
<p>I commend this program to the House.</p>
<p>15/01</p>
<p>Good health in 2023</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, at this time, I must also note, the tremendous loss to the country,</p>
<p>of the sudden death of Sir Wilson Kamit.</p>
<p>Page 22:</p>
<p>Sir Wilson was the first Bank of PNG Governor, following the reforms of Sir Mekere</p>
<p>Morauta. He held the position from 1999 to 2009.</p>
<p>These were good years economically for PNG.</p>
<p>I have been honoured, to have him as one of the three members of the Independent</p>
<p>Advisory Group, on modernizing the current Central Banking Act. He has made a great</p>
<p>contribution to PNG, and I was greatly saddened, by his sudden passing. My sincere</p>
<p>condolences to Lady Winifred, his family, and colleagues.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Mr Jim Hagen, our key contact within the Australian</p>
<p>Treasury, for all the support, he has provided to PNG and the wider Pacific, over many years,</p>
<p>and wish him well in his retirement.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, New Ireland is a matrilineal society. During the Xmas Break and</p>
<p>the first two months of 2023, I met with over 4,000 mothers and youths, to listen to their views</p>
<p>on priorities for 2023. My clear view is that the Marape-Rosso Government is doing the right</p>
<p>things for our mothers, our youths, and our people. There is still a long path to travel before we</p>
<p>reach the living standards that our people deserve but we are taking the right steps forward.</p>
<p>A record K24,567 million 2023 budget, with spending, focused on key priority areas.</p>
<p>K1,177 million assisting households with the cost of living pressures, budget repair of K1,000</p>
<p>million. Economic growth policies focused on rural areas, delivering double the world average</p>
<p>at 3.5 per cent. Inflation moderating to under 6 per cent moving to greater economic</p>
<p>independence. Working constructively and openly with international partners. Implementing</p>
<p>the PANGU Vision, all within our available resources.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Motion (by Mr Rainbo Paita) agreed to —</p>
<p>That the Parliament take note of the statement and debate be adjourned to a subsequent sitting.</p>
