<h3>Supplementary Question</h3>
<p>Supplementary Question</p>
<p>Shortage of Processing Officers</p>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFFA — My question is also to the Deputy Prime Minister and it is in</p>
<p>relation to the same subject.</p>
<p>Can the Minister advise us if there is an intention or plan to expand the services?</p>
<p>Page 9:</p>
<p>Because currently what is happening is they are facing a staffing capacity issue and in</p>
<p>many of the areas where we have migration officers operating, you will find that they are over-</p>
<p>burdened with work. The number of people coming into the country has increased significantly</p>
<p>but the number of officers responsible for managing or processing them has not increased so</p>
<p>can the minister elaborate on this case?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr JOHN ROSSO - Thank you, for that supplementary question. Just to elaborate on</p>
<p>that we have realized that there is a backlog on a lot of these and recently the Chief Migration</p>
<p>Officer has allowed for 28 extra staff to sort out the backlog that we are working on at the</p>
<p>moment. We are also looking at setting up a couple of offices, one will be in Lae to process</p>
<p>passports for people in the Momase and Highlands areas. But for the long line of visas for</p>
<p>coming into the country, yes we have noticed the problem and we have recruited 28 people to</p>
<p>sort out the issues.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Policing Measures To Curb Crime</p>
<p>Mr JACOB KOP MAKI - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and my question is</p>
<p>directed to the Minister for Internal Security.</p>
<p>There are Warlords in Hela Province holding resources in capacity and demanding</p>
<p>ransom, young girls have been taken hostage and repeatedly raped; their criminal acts have</p>
<p>gone viral on social media and circulated which has created fear amongst citizens of this</p>
<p>beautiful Nation.</p>
<p>Recently, an innocent taxi driver was hacked to death by unknown criminals near Edai</p>
<p>Town which also went viral on social media. This is so scary and many innocent lives are</p>
<p>being put at risk; our citizens and foreigners are living in fear.</p>
<p>Can the Minister tell this country through this Floor, what measures have the Police</p>
<p>Department taken so far to deal with the Warlords in Hela and the senseless killing along Papa</p>
<p>Lealea Road? If nothing has been done about them can you explain to the Floor, so that the</p>
<p>people of Papua New Guinea can be aware because this has gone viral?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr PETER TSIAMALILI — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and I would also like to</p>
<p>thank the Member for Mul-Baiyer for asking his question.</p>
<p>Page 10:</p>
<p>From the onset, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members in this</p>
<p>House from each province you —</p>
<p>06/01</p>
<p>Whilst I have this opportunity, I want to say thank you to all the leaders in this House.</p>
<p>When we first met in this Parliament, we said that law and order issue is for all of us. Now, I</p>
<p>want to appreciate you all for the work you as leaders are doing and also appreciate all of you</p>
<p>for work collaborations with your PPCs because we encourage all PPCs to work closely with</p>
<p>the district or you open members including the governors to ensure that they have full visibility</p>
<p>in collaboration and in alignment in curbing the law and order issues.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I must make it clear that there are no warlords in this country. We</p>
<p>must remove that phrase. These are just criminals. We must not label them otherwise.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question in relation to incidents in Hela province, as you and other</p>
<p>leaders would know, we're working closely with the leadership on the ground. Now more than</p>
<p>ever, we need leadership. We are stretched as a force and we all know that. We have only five</p>
<p>thousand men managing and enforcing our law and order issues. We're making every effort</p>
<p>and we have started with the recruitment. We've also identified areas within the force that needs</p>
<p>special attention. Our CID and forensic are addressing that. We are recruiting as I speak.</p>
<p>With the issue up in Hela province, we have special policing zone for western front and</p>
<p>again we are working closely with the leadership on the ground. We're making every effort for</p>
<p>us to manage this scenario that is happening in the Western Front up in Hela province and also</p>
<p>across the country.</p>
<p>So, I am just asking for support from you leaders. This is not going to happen overnight.</p>
<p>This issue did not just happen in 2023 or 2022 or 2021. This is a combination of the neglect</p>
<p>our force had over a period of 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>I'm probably having sleepless nights and I’m taking that responsibly to ensure that we</p>
<p>work together with our operational side of the police.</p>
<p>There will also be some amendments that will be coming to the Floor for us to make</p>
<p>some more strong laws or enforce strong laws to deter this type of actions by our citizens.</p>
<p>So, with that, Honourable Member for Mul-Baiyer, I hope that I have answered your</p>
<p>question. We're doing everything possible to ensure that we address the lawlessness that is at</p>
<p>the forefront of this country.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Sir Puka Temu — Point of Order!</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - What is your point of order?</p>
<p>Sir Puka Temu — Honourable Acting Speaker, the good Member clearly asked the</p>
<p>Honourable Minister what the force is doing with regards to some of those specific incidents.</p>
<p>Some photographs of these criminals went viral on Facebook so, tell the country what the force</p>
<p>is doing rather than making a general statement. Are there people going out there looking for</p>
<p>them here in Boiera and up in Hela? This is because their pictures were posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>Tell the country what you are doing and when you are going to apprehend them.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>07/01</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - The Honourable Members Point of Order is in regard to the</p>
<p>question the Honourable Member for Mul-Baiyer has asked regarding the incident that</p>
<p>happened and the Members want you to inform the House on what actions have been taken on</p>
<p>this particular incident that took place. Can you answer the questions raised by the Honourable</p>
<p>Member?</p>
<p>Mr PETER TSIAMALILI — Thank you Acting Speaker, firstly the social media and</p>
<p>the type of exposure that the platform has also impeaches on the Ministry of Communication</p>
<p>because we are talking about the cyber-crime space. And also, the general public using this</p>
<p>platform to expose all these sorts of behavior now are days.</p>
<p>In terms of the prosecution of these culprits which were already exposed the cyber-crime</p>
<p>officers have been assigned to look into such incidents. Before the police officers carry out the</p>
<p>prosecution they have to follow the processes in place by visiting the crime scene and take</p>
<p>reports.</p>
<p>With that I want to assure the House that the police have taken action but will go through</p>
<p>a process. On the question of the progress report of the incident in Lealeah, I assure the House</p>
<p>that I will get an update report and report back to Parliament.</p>
<p>In relation to the process, we have already initiated and I will report on its progress as to</p>
<p>the arrest of the culprits.</p>

<p>Status of Carbon Trade Secretariat</p>
<p>Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE -— In 2021, the Parliament passed the Climate Change</p>
<p>Management Act. One of the reasons for that particular Act is to have in place a Secretariat to</p>
<p>monitor the carbon trade activities in the country. Because of no Secretariat in place there was</p>
<p>a moratorium that was imposed by the previous minister, whilst it was in place there were some</p>
<p>organisation like NIHT and FORSET who went to some parts of my district and signed some</p>
<p>carbon trade activities with some of my people.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
