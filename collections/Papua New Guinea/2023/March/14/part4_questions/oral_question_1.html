<p>(2) If this is so, what will the Minister do to rectify this because this is not proper?</p>
<p>Mr RAINBO PAITA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Minister, for Hansard purposes please, address the Chair</p>
<p>as Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr RAINBO PAITA -— Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the good Governor for</p>
<p>his question relating to one district in Enga province which its district treasury operating</p>
<p>outside of the province.</p>
<p>Page 5:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I have not seen any documents regarding this issue but I have heard</p>
<p>rumours within my department that the Governor visited the Department Secretary in regards</p>
<p>to that issue and I have not yet received that letter from the Ministerial office but I will follow</p>
<p>up today and if there is such a practise. I understand when there are special circumstances for</p>
<p>example, when there were fights in Mendi, there were steps taken for normal government</p>
<p>process to take function like treasury and other relevant district services.</p>
<p>In respect to the question, I will see relevant offices and respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Youth Unemployment</p>
<p>Mr JAMES NOMANE - My question is directed to the Minister for Treasury. From</p>
<p>the last Parliament Sitting were we voted the Governor-General there were few things that</p>
<p>happened. We had droves of young men and women outside the Stanley Hotel in the thousands</p>
<p>applying for about twenty jobs, minimal labour jobs -</p>
<p>03/01</p>
<p>Waiters, waitresses. We had 700, degree holders apply to become teachers at the</p>
<p>University of Goroka. We’ve recently had the Lae Biscuit Company shut down for two weeks</p>
<p>because it can’t sell its products. We’ve got a youth bulge issue in the country that the House</p>
<p>must take note of, Mr Acting Speaker. There’s, too many young people without any prospects</p>
<p>or opportunity for employment in the country.</p>
<p>So my question to the honourable Treasurer is, what is the Government’s plan for</p>
<p>employment? How do we address this issue of youth unemployment? What do we do to</p>
<p>increase the number of people that are gainfully employed so this can directly address the rising</p>
<p>crime rate that we are seeing in the country now. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I want to the thank the</p>
<p>Vice Minister and the honorable member for his very timely question on what plans the</p>
<p>Marape/Rosso Government has to creating jobs in our country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, there are a number of initiatives at a very high level that this</p>
<p>Government has taken to create jobs and this is one of the very key initiatives that our</p>
<p>Government has been working on and must continue to work on.</p>
<p>Ata high level from a budget perspective, Mr Acting Speaker we continue to restructure</p>
<p>our budget to ensure that we pump more money into those economic activities that will create</p>
<p>jobs. I’m referring here to our capital budget which three years ago when we took office was</p>
<p>Page 6:</p>
<p>sitting around at about a K4.6 billion this year as the honourable member knows in his planning</p>
<p>documents, we’ve increased that to K9,7 billion. Of that particular budget our Public</p>
<p>Investment Promotion Public Investment Project component, we’ve increased it to a little bit</p>
<p>over K3 billion when we took over office to around about K6. 6 billion, a 220 per cent increase.</p>
<p>At a high level from a budget perspective, that’s what we have done. But of course Mr Acting</p>
<p>Speaker, there are other issues when we talk about creating jobs.</p>
<p>If you recall Mr Acting Speaker, I had answered this question back in about 2020 when</p>
<p>I was asked and I mentioned that then that the jobs growth for any Government will be</p>
<p>delivered by pro- job and pro - growth policies. With our Government as you know. Vice</p>
<p>Minister we have a target at ten thousand jobs in the formal economy and many more in the</p>
<p>informal economy which covers of course our SMEs and rural workers.</p>
<p>So one of our first targets is, we need to make sure to make PNG an internationally</p>
<p>competitive economy, including through ensuring our wage rates are brought into line with</p>
<p>regional averages. Of course higher wages can mean less jobs in an economy such as PNG. So</p>
<p>it’s always about getting the right balance.</p>
<p>The Marape/Rosso Government is very much focused on building the agriculture,</p>
<p>fisheries and tourism sectors and increasing of course downstream processing. And of course</p>
<p>last weekend we saw the results of some of the good work being completed and implemented</p>
<p>in the Gazelle Electorate. Of course we need to continue to look at greater funding in our</p>
<p>infrastructure and we have done that by setting PNG Connect as our signature policy and in</p>
<p>this year’s budget, I am very pleased to advise our country and the House that we have</p>
<p>implemented one of the legislative changes that we made which was to ensure that 5.6 per cent</p>
<p>I think it is, I stand to be corrected of our annual revenue forecast is put aside for that particular</p>
<p>04/01</p>
<p>I think six per cent, I stand to be corrected of our annual revenue focus is put a side for</p>
<p>that particular program. This year if I recall correctly we had budgeted K1.2 billion. So that’s</p>
<p>some of the things that we’ve been doing so far.</p>
<p>In agriculture for example, some of the exciting initiative that we have taken we’ve</p>
<p>properly invested in a state equity fund of K40 million last year. It was to support the expansion</p>
<p>of large-scale projects.</p>
<p>We have created new ministry of Coffee and Palm Oil to ensure a focus of these key areas</p>
<p>of investment. We have significant investment in roads like we’ve mentioned. I’m very happy</p>
<p>to provide a detail statement or perhaps my colleague minister for Works can do that to detail</p>
<p>Page 7:</p>
<p>the record number of contracts that have been issued and to explain in a way that our people</p>
<p>can understand. I won’t go into some of the examples of the roads projects which we’ve</p>
<p>covered already here.</p>
<p>So, I will just move on very quickly to fisheries investment. In this particular space we</p>
<p>need to properly invest in our Pacific Marine Industrial Zones. Last year off course, we Budget</p>
<p>K100 million and this year we have our new effective Minister for International Trade and</p>
<p>Investment working on that. Off course, we also need to expand our rural jetties. Last year we</p>
<p>have budgeted K4 million and this year I think we double that amount.</p>
<p>In tourism again an untouched and a huge potential for our country that we continue to</p>
<p>talk about. I will leave some more detail discussions to the Minister for Tourism, Arts and</p>
<p>Culture.</p>
<p>But lastly, other initiative that help us create more jobs is to deal with the greatest barrier</p>
<p>of doing business in our country. And we’ve heard in the last three and the half years and in</p>
<p>fact before that when we took government that foreign exchange reforms together with reforms</p>
<p>to the Central Banking Act must take place. And I’m very happy to advise that later this</p>
<p>afternoon I will touch a little more on that.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Granting of Tourist Visa on arrival</p>
<p>Mr SASINDRAN MUTHUVEL - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My question is</p>
<p>directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and acting Minister for Immigration. The Treasurer</p>
<p>recently spoke about the importance of tourism, as we all know it is a multibillion-kina</p>
<p>industry. I don’t know the reason why it is very difficult to get visa, complain raised by the</p>
<p>tourist.</p>
<p>It’s a multibillion-dollar industry but to get visa to enter the country is the most difficult</p>
<p>tasks.</p>
<p>Can the Acting Minister for Immigration and the Deputy Prime Minister assure this</p>
<p>House that the promised visa on arrival that was agreed to 2015 when the President of India</p>
<p>visited Papua New Guinea can be revisited because we are expecting another visit from the</p>
<p>Prime Minister of India this year?</p>
<p>So, can we grant on arrival tourist visa for India because they are ranked third in the world</p>
<p>economy and at the moment they are in fourth place.</p>
<p>So, the Minister can clarify as to why we delay in giving tourist visa to India and other</p>
<p>countries as well.</p>
<p>Ss)</p>
<p>Page 8:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr JOHN ROSSO - Thank you, very much Acting Speaker, and I appreciate the good</p>
<p>Governor of West New Britain for raising this very critical question.</p>
<p>05/01</p>
<p>The case regarding tourist visa is a very big issue and it is not an easy solution for us to</p>
<p>Just give visas. This means interacting with Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign</p>
<p>Affairs just recently updated us that he is working on rectifying a lot of the issues that we</p>
<p>have had with the backlog of Foreign Affairs problems associated with other countries so that</p>
<p>we can be able to allow visas to be done and issued.</p>
<p>One thing which we have uplifted is the Business Visas which now are 12 months</p>
<p>business visas which is short-term where businesses can apply only once and work quickly in</p>
<p>a month go back so they don’t apply every time they want to go. So it makes it a quicker and</p>
<p>easy turn-around time in light of the upcoming mines and also for our current businesses in</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Quite rightfully said so the good Governor has mentioned Tourism which is a very</p>
<p>important aspect that we need to look into and sort out. We are in constant talks with our good</p>
<p>Foreigner Affairs Minister and he has also just updated me also that Indonesian and Indian</p>
<p>diplomatic visas will be on arrival for the diplomatic staff that is coming in from them and we</p>
<p>will also be looking at the Philippines and Koreans Visas.</p>
<p>So, we are working at rectifying a lot of these things he also mentioned that some of</p>
<p>these have been backlogs for over eight years that have not been done and he is now sorting it</p>
<p>out with our immigration office to rectify a lot of these issues.</p>
<p>So, yes we are working on it and it is very important and we will be able to sort it out</p>
<p>and announce it to Parliament in the following months.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
