<p>(2) Is the moratorium on the carbon trade activity in place as yet or not?</p>
<p>(3) What action will the Government take on these two particular companies in Pomio</p>
<p>now especially the FORSET and NIHT, who are actually causing some chaos and confusion</p>
<p>amongst my people?</p>
<p>Mr SIMON KILEPA -— Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, firstly, I would like to thank the</p>
<p>Member for Pomio for his questions. Before answering the questions, I would like to thank the</p>
<p>people of Lufa for electing me as their mandated leader to represent them on this Floor of</p>
<p>Parliament.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to thank the Marape/Rosso Government and my party leader,</p>
<p>United Resource Party for entrusting me with this Ministry. Thirdly, I would like to thank the</p>
<p>Opposition Leader and our brothers in the Opposition. And I would also like to acknowledge</p>
<p>our two lady leaders in the House.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the NIHT and the FORSET are based on volunteering carbon scheme</p>
<p>and they have been in the country since 2019. The moratorium that was in place has lapsed in</p>
<p>2021. Actually they were here before the moratorium was placed by the former minister.</p>
<p>But right now, we are working on the carbon trade markets regulations which is now with</p>
<p>State Solicitor so once the certificate on necessity are done and approved by the State Solicitor,</p>
<p>we will then remove the moratorium.</p>
<p>08/01</p>
<p>Right now, there is a moratorium for voluntary market so there is no new company</p>
<p>coming in for voluntary markets. Currently, the regulation is being scheduled for the certificate</p>
<p>of necessity. As for NITH, they are operating in New Ireland since 2019 and they have been</p>
<p>Page 13:</p>
<p>operating under the Climate Change Development Authority to deal with the voluntary carbon</p>
<p>credits.</p>
<p>The report on ABC was done in the forestry area, but that is not covered in the area that</p>
<p>it is operating to conserve the forest. It is done away from the area, in the logging areas to give</p>
<p>disrepute to our credits, in saying that PNG does not have the capacity or the credits. We have</p>
<p>the credits and we are looking to modify the credits with the PNG Forest Authority and other</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders at this moment.</p>
<p>As for the question asked by the Member for Pomio, I will check with my staff and will</p>
<p>come back with an answer on his electorate. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE - Point of Order! Thank you, to the two ministers for</p>
<p>answering my questions. I have another question in regards to what he said about the two</p>
<p>companies being there before the moratorium.</p>
<p>(1) Can your ministry conduct an audit on the works of the companies in my district</p>
<p>because there has been some misunderstanding between the people there?</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Member, your point of order has already been</p>
<p>answered when the Minister said he will go back to his ministry and do a specific report on</p>
<p>your electorate and report back to you. Minister do you have anything to say on that or I will</p>
<p>rule out the point of order?</p>
<p>Mr SIMON KILEPA — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. As I have stated earlier, I will</p>
<p>go back to my Ministry and get the right information to come and present to the Member for</p>
<p>Pomio.</p>
<p>Expansion of National Development Bank in rural areas</p>
<p>Sir PUKA TEMU - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to the</p>
<p>minister responsible for the National Development Bank. I do not know if that will be the</p>
<p>Minister for State Owned Enterprises.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I would like to ask the question to the honourable Minister in regards</p>
<p>to access to credit for the rural masses. We can acknowledge today, that our banking systems</p>
<p>mostly operates at the provincial level, and with regards to some of them with very bad or</p>
<p>difficult policies and loans and many other conditions. Our rural masses miss out big time.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, once upon a time, the National Development Bank had a branch in</p>
<p>Kupiano in Abau District. That has over time, lost its extension. Recently, 10 years ago, there</p>
<p>Page 14:</p>
<p>was another attempt by the National Development Bank to continue to build facilities for access</p>
<p>to credit for our rural masses.</p>
<p>My question is;</p>
<p>(1) Would the Minister consider a program of picking up the establishment of National</p>
<p>Development Bank branches at the district level?</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to also thank the</p>
<p>Member for Abau, Sir Puka Temu, for this important question. This question also applies to</p>
<p>many of our leaders in Parliament today.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the bank until 2017, received direct funding from the government</p>
<p>through the National Budget to be able to continue to provide service and also to cater for</p>
<p>expansion of its services to many of our rural areas. That stopped when the government stop</p>
<p>providing funding to them.</p>
<p>The NDB is not a normal commercial bank as we are familiarised with. It is a</p>
<p>development bank and under the rules of operation, it is only allowed to charge interest on the</p>
<p>monies that it lends at the rate below four to three per cent, which is just enough to keep its</p>
<p>operational expenses going. It is not meant to make profit for its shareholders.</p>
<p>That is the situation with the bank that we all have to understand. If we do allow to charge</p>
<p>interest more than four per cent, it will be able to make some money. In the case of expansion</p>
<p>in rural areas, the bank has through some of its internal sources been able to establish some</p>
<p>branches in collaboration with some of our leaders.</p>
<p>For example, a couple of years ago, the former Member for Maprik allocated some of his</p>
<p>DSIP funds and we were able to have a branch constructed in Maprik, and that was opened by</p>
<p>our Prime Minister. Another example would be the case for Tari District. That bank was opened</p>
<p>by the Prime and myself.</p>
<p>It is open to our members to allocate some funding to be able to open up branches in your</p>
<p>electorates. The bank will try and come up with the balance and together we can work in</p>
<p>partnership to open those.</p>
<p>As I have said earlier, these are the circumstances that the bank is allowed to operate in</p>
<p>if the interest rates are below four per cent, which is not enough to actively enable the bank to</p>
<p>make a decision written on the investments.</p>
<p>Page 15:</p>
<p>It is open and up to all of us to work together. We will expect a contribution from our</p>
<p>local members and the bank will contribute its share and start allocating staff and the technical</p>
<p>equipment that will be installed in those premises to be able to run an operation for our people.</p>
<p>I do not wish to repeat but the bank is prepared to work with our members as long as</p>
<p>there is a contribution from the members. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>09/01</p>
<p>Tolukuma Mine Closure</p>
<p>Mr CASMIRO AIA - Thank you Acting Speaker. Thank you for recognizing the</p>
<p>people of Goilala to speak in this Honourable House.</p>
<p>By way of background, before I direct my question to the Minister for Mining.</p>
<p>Tolukuma is a mine that for some unknown reason changes ownership from time to time. The</p>
<p>ownership must have been changed four to five times.</p>
<p>Before petroleum came in and it was given to Asidoko and now the mine was</p>
<p>unofficially or deliberately or I don’t know by mistake or by design shut down. The future of</p>
<p>the mine is not in the clear visibility.</p>
<p>In recent times there was a K20 million promised to the land owners. All my people</p>
<p>flocked down to the city and have been here for almost some months now and they keep on</p>
<p>congregating at APEC Park at the back of the Post Office along Angau Drive to see whether</p>
<p>that money is going to be made available.</p>
<p>Can the good Minister, clearly state the status of this K20 million that was promised to</p>
<p>the people? Number two clearly demarcate or specify the purpose of that money. Is it for the</p>
<p>employees who are being laid off or is it for the landowners? There needs to be some</p>
<p>understanding, so they are not wasting their time walking down. We walk for five days to get</p>
<p>here until God will, we'll build our roads. My people they have walked all the way here and</p>
<p>they have been here for some months now.</p>
<p>Can the good minister for the sake of my people, provide some clarity regarding this</p>
<p>money so my people can go back to the village and hide in the bush? Thank you, Deputy</p>
<p>Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Mining.</p>
<p>Sir ANO PALA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker and thank you Member for Goilala</p>
<p>for that question. Mr Acting Speaker, I am not aware of this K20 million committed for the</p>
<p>Page 16:</p>
<p>landowners or for the mine but I will look into it. I will find out what was this K20 million for</p>
<p>and advise on the status of the funds. I understand that the Tolukuma mine is not closed. When</p>
<p>a mine is closed there is a mine closure procedure one has to go through and I don’t think that</p>
<p>the mine closure procedures has been activated. This is because of the status of the mine which</p>
<p>I think was not being closed. | think the mine is in transition at the moment. It has passed on</p>
<p>from one investor to another and it appears very clear that the mine at the moment is not</p>
<p>profitable. That is why investors are reluctant to put in more money.</p>
<p>10/01</p>
<p>The main reason why the mine is not profitable is because of the fly in and fly out</p>
<p>arrangements. That is, operation is conducted by way of helicopter flight and if you are going</p>
<p>in and out by helicopters, it’s a very, very expensive process. But there are also some investors</p>
<p>looking at the way forward but that most important infrastructure that we need to build in that</p>
<p>area is a road from Moresby all the way to Goilala. And that is the only way that mine can be</p>
<p>profitable.</p>
<p>So, it is something that the government will look at down the line because I feel that</p>
<p>there is a very big potential for that mine but we have to make it viable. And the only way we</p>
<p>can do it is to build that road to encourage businesses to go in. At the moment the only way to</p>
<p>go in is fly in and fly out and the businesses are not very encouraged to spend the money. So</p>
<p>that’s where we are on that mine and I’m just hoping that we will find a way.</p>
<p>I’ve just recently received an offer and I will be talking to you and governor; our good</p>
<p>governor to take up this offer from one of the big mining companies in the country to do scoping</p>
<p>work free of charge. So, I will be referring it to you and the governor if you are in agreement,</p>
<p>you can invite this company to go and do the scoping work so that you will be able to then put</p>
<p>the figures before the government for us to consider but the main question for the K20 million,</p>
<p>Member for Goilala, I will go back and look at where these funds are, if they are there and if</p>
<p>they have been committed, and I will advise you on the status. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER -— Honourable members, we have two more minutes for</p>
<p>question time but seems there is no questions to be asked, so I’ll ask the Minister for Treasury</p>
<p>to make his Ministerial Statement. Honourable Minister.</p>
