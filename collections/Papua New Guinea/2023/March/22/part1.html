<p>ANNOUNCEMENT —- MEETING TIMES —</p>
<p>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ~ Honourable Members, before I go on to the Order</p>
<p>of the day, I’d like to inform both sides of the House; the Government and the</p>
<p>Opposition, in accordance to the Standing Order, Section 36 (2) and (3), its states very</p>
<p>clearly that as the Parliament, we are to go strictly by the time of attending Parliament</p>
<p>session.</p>
<p>Page 2:</p>
<p>Therefore, I, on behalf of the Speaker, would like to make this statement to the</p>
<p>Honourable House and Honourable Members that as of tomorrow, we will go strictly</p>
<p>by the Standing Order so that we show punctuality in attendance during Parliament</p>
<p>session.</p>
<p>So, I am putting this on notice that the first bell will be rung and it will be</p>
<p>suspended to a certain time when there is no quorum. And if there is still no quorum</p>
<p>at the time announced during suspension, the Speaker will adjourn Parliament to the</p>
<p>next sitting day.</p>
<p>Therefore, I urge all the Members of Parliament to respect the Standing Order</p>
<p>and to attend Parliament session on time so that we conduct the business of our people</p>
<p>in this Honourable House.</p>
</body>
