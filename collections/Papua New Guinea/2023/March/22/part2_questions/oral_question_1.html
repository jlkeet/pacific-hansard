<p>(2) In this year’s 2023 Budget, how much money has been allocated for WASH?</p>
<p>(3) What is the progress on our national goal, as in how much progress have we made</p>
<p>towards that 70 per cent accessibility to clean safe water and sanitation?</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
<p>Page 7:</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Vice Minister and</p>
<p>Member for Rai Coast for asking these important questions in terms of how water can be</p>
<p>connected to all the families right across the country to be used to benefit from an improved</p>
<p>lifestyle.</p>
<p>I know that we are running through the mid-life of the current WASH Plan that targets</p>
<p>2030 for 70 per cent of our citizens and households to have access to clean and safe water, and</p>
<p>sanitation.</p>
<p>Just to answer one question quickly, there has been K7 million allocated for this year’s</p>
<p>budget and I want to show appreciation to European Union and the Australian DFAT, and all</p>
<p>our other development partners.</p>
<p>We have a program of up to K600 million worth of contracts that Australian DFAT,</p>
<p>ADB, European Union, and World Bank are all partners in, to help to maintain cost to possibly</p>
<p>reach 70 per cent of our citizens and households in our country. So, the target of reaching 70</p>
<p>per cent remains by 2030.</p>
<p>In 2023 from indications, anywhere between 20 to 40 per cent depending on which part</p>
<p>of the country we are at, but on average from 20 to 40 per cent delivery thus far.</p>
<p>05/06</p>
<p>I want to give an assurance to the honourable leader who has asked this question that our</p>
<p>government is conscious about the need and rights for the people to have access to clean water.</p>
<p>This is a commitment of our government that is why this year, we have K7 million parked as</p>
<p>an indication of our support to counter fund this program going forward.</p>
<p>In relation to when will the bill be coming, the bill that this government proposed to</p>
<p>embrace is in its final stage. It will be completed very soon and this Parliament will have the</p>
<p>opportunity to look at and pass the bill in relation to WASH.</p>
<p>Mr Deputy Speaker, on the issue of an extra organization, we are a little bit careful about</p>
<p>it. We already have the District Development Authority, provincial governments and our</p>
<p>National Water PNG on our programs. Every new organization created in our country has a</p>
<p>cost of recurrent maintenance apart from the development programs. We are conscious on</p>
<p>creation of new authorities, but in the absence of that authority, this might happen in the future.</p>
<p>The districts and provinces have funding allegations under the disbursement guidelines</p>
<p>and the procurement process. The districts and provinces can run on programs for localized</p>
<p>needs pertaining to the issue of water, health and sanitation of our people. Therefore, I would</p>
<p>like to encourage all districts and provinces to embrace the WASH policy that my government</p>
<p>Page 8:</p>
<p>embraces in totality. It is our people's right to have access to clean water wherever they are</p>
<p>living.</p>
<p>So, when you receive funding and run your districts and provinces, treat the need for</p>
<p>water in as far as your people is concerned, as a key need at the national level. We have not</p>
<p>deviated from the focus of delivering to our country's 70 per cent of clean reliable water by</p>
<p>2030. That focus remains and we are ramping up on our national policy and national focus. I</p>
<p>encourage the districts and provinces to be mindful about this important need and get going.</p>
<p>Our partnership with the development partners will remain into the future and I will let</p>
<p>the Minister for Planning to deliver a statement in relation to the water, health and sanitation</p>
<p>issue for people.</p>
<p>Today is World Water Day, please use water wisely and as Members, let's try to work in</p>
<p>this program to give our people reliable and clean water.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>UOG - Teacher Training Programs</p>
<p>Mr RAPHAEL TONPI — Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish to ask this question to</p>
<p>the Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and Sports.</p>
<p>Is the Minister aware that the University of Goroka is the third largest of the seven</p>
<p>universities in Papua New Guinea? So far, it is the largest teacher education institution in our</p>
<p>country. I am happy that it is an institution which was primarily established for the purpose of</p>
<p>teacher training which has over time developed into a university.</p>
<p>What saddens me and therefore prompts me to ask these questions is that, the end product</p>
<p>is missed from the quality of performance by students in our high schools and secondary</p>
<p>schools in the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, my questions are as follows;</p>
<p>(1) Is the University of Goroka producing the same quality of trained teachers for the</p>
<p>future of our children or in the name of continuous upgrade and review conducted over time,</p>
<p>it has gradually deviated from the main focus of training quality teachers?</p>
<p>(2) Can the Minister confirm or deny that the University of Goroka has deviated from the</p>
<p>main teacher training, and therefore compromised the quality of teacher output?</p>
<p>(3) If so, can the Minister put in place a review with the aim to assess whether proper</p>
<p>teacher training is conducted to benefit the students?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr DON POLYE - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. These questions are critical and</p>
<p>also very strategic in so far as the University of Goroka and all our universities, technical</p>
<p>institutions and the colleges are concerned, whether it be a teaching college or nursing or any</p>
<p>other institution.</p>
<p>The question relates to all those tertiary institutions in the country, but UOG in particular.</p>
<p>The questions probably refer to three areas: the quality and the relevance of students coming</p>
<p>out of the lower institutions up to the higher education institutions; what the government is</p>
<p>doing in particular with UOG; and if UOG has the diversified programs away from teaching.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, in terms of quality, I have not done a specific study to assess the</p>
<p>quality. But generally, I’ve assessed the output and the performance, looked at the programs of</p>
<p>universities and UOG has been no exception. I’ve looked at it and I’m looking at some of the</p>
<p>programs of the University of Goroka at the very present time as I answer these questions from</p>
<p>the Honourable Member for Mendi.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the quality in this country from a general observation, from the</p>
<p>report I get is that, we have probably allowed the quality of education, especially the higher</p>
<p>education, skilled development and academic knowledge to drop to a level that we now realise,</p>
<p>we must improve. Quality is very important and it starts in the following areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, Mr Assistant Speaker, is the governance and leadership on the campus of the</p>
<p>University of Goroka. For other institutions, I have to some extent realised that the composition</p>
<p>of governance and the vice chancellors or especially at the council level, and then right down</p>
<p>to the structure of the management system. I think there’s been a lot of compromise where I</p>
<p>find that the best people have not been appointed to leadership and governance roles at those</p>
<p>institutions. UOG is being addressed in that perspective.</p>
<p>I have confidence in the council, the vice chancellor and the team working there, but</p>
<p>we’ll work together with them to address the leadership and governance issues to address the</p>
<p>areas of quality.</p>
<p>I’ve decided that under the Higher Education’s General Provisions Act, where it places</p>
<p>the authority of appointment on the Minister, I’d like to inform the Parliament and the people</p>
<p>that I will change that in the Act not to put the authority of appointing the council and the</p>
<p>administration on the Minister. It will be done by a collective body and I am looking at the</p>
<p>Higher Education Technical Council to make the decision and recommend to the Cabinet.</p>
<p>So, we will free up politicizing of those positions at the council level or even through the</p>
<p>council on the administration level and the vice’s level. We will put a collective decision-</p>
<p>Page 10:</p>
<p>making body that will work with the National Executive Council to observe those and that’s</p>
<p>where quality will start. When you put leadership and governance to the right composition then</p>
<p>you will find that there will be right people available to drive quality down the whole institution</p>
<p>especially, programs. That’s number one.</p>
<p>Number two, how we are addressing the issue of quality. In terms of registering every</p>
<p>university in Papua New Guinea or other institutions that comes under the Higher Education</p>
<p>space, they must meet a national registration standard. That means they have to meet all the</p>
<p>requirements to be called a university or higher education institution. That is being looked at</p>
<p>and I’m doing it to make sure that UOG and other universities must qualify to be universities</p>
<p>because they meet that standard of registration. That means every lecturer must be qualified or</p>
<p>have an accreditation. That means those professors must earn that title professor because</p>
<p>they’re doing research and work. Those that are in the dean level in those particular areas or</p>
<p>the schools must also earn by the standards that we will implement.</p>
<p>07/06</p>
<p>So, registration is very important because when people are qualified to a certain level,</p>
<p>they will impart knowledge to teachers to go and teach students, then the quality of education</p>
<p>that the Member is referring to will be achieved because of quality registered institutions.</p>
<p>The third point is the accreditation of the programs being taught there. The University of</p>
<p>Goroka offers not only education and teacher training programs, but also other diversified</p>
<p>areas. The programs that are being taught there must be accredited to a standard, not just to the</p>
<p>university’s standard but also to the national qualification standard. The national qualification</p>
<p>standard is coordinated and driven by the Department of Higher Education, Research, Science</p>
<p>and Technology.</p>
<p>That standard is bench-marked against some of the best practices in the world. The</p>
<p>University of Goroka is correlating and working in partnership with a network of institutions</p>
<p>and affiliated accreditation standards in the world so that we have the best programs offered to</p>
<p>teachers. The accreditation of programs is very important because that is how we are addressing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Another area that I also want to talk about is the research in these institutions. UOG must</p>
<p>do research. There cannot be a university if it does offer research programs.</p>
<p>The final area in terms of quality is the digitalization of some programs; online or virtual</p>
<p>learning. We would like to increase the number of students that graduated from the University</p>
<p>of Goroka with quality teaching skills. There are some programs that can be offered online to</p>
<p>Page 11:</p>
<p>students who may not be able to attend the university due to lack of space, accommodation or</p>
<p>learning facilities. Those are the areas that we are addressing in terms of the quality programs</p>
<p>that must be taught.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, we have started a review. We also have external auditors on</p>
<p>standby at the direction of the higher education sector or the department to conduct independent</p>
<p>review of the programs at the University of Goroka.</p>
<p>The other question was on UOG deviating from teaching to other areas. From my point</p>
<p>of view, a university is a university, meaning they have a broader area of programs that they</p>
<p>can administer. I do not see that as a problem if they deviate from teaching. Under the current</p>
<p>circumstances, I am informed that every year, we need to graduate 800 teachers.</p>
<p>The University of Goroka can only graduate 400 to 600 students in a year. The Divine</p>
<p>Word Open Campus in East New Britain graduates 100 to 200 students per year to meet the</p>
<p>mark of 800 but we still fall short of teachers.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the point that was raised by the honourable Member is a valid</p>
<p>point. Why should we try to diversify when we are still not meeting the target of graduating</p>
<p>800 teachers from UOG per year?</p>
<p>That was one of the questions that I have raised with the vice chancellors’ committee. I</p>
<p>have established a vice chancellors’ committee whose chair is at University of Technology.</p>
<p>They will address these issues and assist UOG to rationalise the programs. Some programs that</p>
<p>are taught in some universities are not relevant; for instance, environment, humanities and</p>
<p>political science are taught in UOG, as well as UPNG.</p>
<p>UPNG should be offering these programs so that the University of Goroka can</p>
<p>concentrate on expanding more on the training of teachers. These programs are put in place so</p>
<p>that all universities are cohesive and are working together. The same can be done for technical</p>
<p>institutions and colleges so everyone can work together to complement or supplement each</p>
<p>other to achieve the quality programs that I am talking about.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, we are addressing those issues vehemently, and we are keen to see</p>
<p>improvement in the next three to five years. In this term of Parliament, I have a very strong</p>
<p>conviction to improve the quality of education and increase the number of teachers that are</p>
<p>graduating and going out to the schools. We will then find relevance in the programs that we</p>
<p>are administering through these institutions.</p>
<p>Page 12:</p>
<p>08/06</p>
<p>Finally, Mr Assistant Speaker, I was asked a similar question about the National</p>
<p>Polytechnic Institute by the Member for Gumine, after the question time, I would ask leave of</p>
<p>the Parliament to answer those question as well. Thank you.</p>
