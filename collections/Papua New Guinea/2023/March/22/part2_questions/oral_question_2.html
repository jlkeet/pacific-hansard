<p>Supplementary Question</p>
<p>UOG Must Specialise In Teacher Training</p>
<p>Mr BENJAMIN MUL - I heard that The University of Goroka (UOG) was set out for</p>
<p>teacher training only. When we talk about quality, we must have proper training for teachers</p>
<p>to train our students so that we can produce the best brains in our country.</p>
<p>I heard that Goroka is introducing general courses, like those that are taught at the</p>
<p>University of Technology and the University of Papua New Guinea. That is why I really want</p>
<p>the Minister to do away with all this general courses and specialise only on teaching at the</p>
<p>University of Goroka so that we have best teachers to teach our students in our country.</p>
<p>When we talk about quality, we must have quality teachers’ college too, not only the</p>
<p>University of Goroka but other teachers’ colleges too. Then we are going to produce quality</p>
<p>students in our country and they are going to come and look after us in the future.</p>
<p>Right now we are playing up with the country by playing up with the education and |</p>
<p>really want to ask the Minister for Higher Education, can you do away with the general courses</p>
<p>in the University of Goroka and specialise only on teacher training?</p>
<p>Mr DON POLYE — | think in the course of answering the question, I did say that there</p>
<p>is a team that I have formed called the University Vice Chancellors Committee and I have</p>
<p>charged them to look at the courses taught in UOG as well as other universities to see how we</p>
<p>can rationalize. That means that if we must tell UOG to cut down or abolish the other programs</p>
<p>and focus on teachers training only, we will do that. There are strong reasons to do that and I</p>
<p>have already given the assurance and by the next 3-5 years’, you will see that UOG is trimmed,</p>
<p>right-sized, corrected and a quality institution, giving quality teachers to Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree, but I will do it strategically and properly through the Committee that was</p>
<p>established. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr STEVEN PIM ~ Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for recognizing the people of</p>
<p>Dei. Since I was elected I have not said anything in the Parliament, my people might think that</p>
<p>Page 13:</p>
<p>I am mute, but I was trying to learn from the senior and experienced statesman in this</p>
<p>Parliament. I have observed and now I feel like I want to let out some air.</p>
<p>(Members laughter)</p>
<p>Mr STEVEN PIM - First of all, thank you, Prime Minister. You are a good man, all of</p>
<p>us have appointed you so you must recognize us too. I thank our party leaders and our governors</p>
<p>of the country. I am thankful that we have some powerful governors and we the members</p>
<p>appreciate the inputs that you have made to our country. I thank my party leader, Honourable</p>
<p>Peter O’Neill, you are a good man, and you have built a lot of infrastructure. There has been</p>
<p>both good and bad but he did his part during his term.</p>
<p>Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER — Honourable Member, I will allow you to ask your</p>
<p>question to which Minister you want to ask.</p>
<p>Appointment of NAC Managing Director</p>
<p>Mr STEVEN PIM -Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. My question is directed to the</p>
<p>Minister for Civil Aviation and the Prime Minister can take note.</p>
<p>This is in regards to the National Airport Corporation. It is a very important entity and in</p>
<p>the recent past there was a lot of politics in terms of fighting for the managing director’s</p>
<p>position.</p>
<p>I understand after Joseph Kintau, there was another Managing Director and after that</p>
<p>Managing Director, Rex Kiponge was the Managing Director and he performed exceptionally</p>
<p>well but he did not meet some of the criteria. He did not work with the Minister, so the Minister</p>
<p>brought in some legislations and the Minister then rightfully took control over the organization,</p>
<p>I assume.</p>
<p>09/06</p>
<p>My questions specifically relate to the critical issues of safety, security and compliance.</p>
<p>With that I make reference to a recent Post-Courier article dated Friday 10th March 2023, and</p>
<p>I quote, ‘National Airport Corporation Managing Director Acting position illegally extended’.</p>
<p>The article reported that the National Airport Corporation Board had met on 3rd March 2023</p>
<p>and illegally extended the Acting Managing Director’s term for another three months. And I</p>
<p>Page 14:</p>
<p>believe it was without the consultation of the NEC and contrary to the Civil Aviation Act, which</p>
<p>we passed in December.</p>
<p>My four questions to the Minister are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Does the board’s action make the acting managing director’s appointment illegal and</p>
<p>therefore create a legal vacuum in the managing director’s position and if so, does this violates</p>
<p>Aviation Security and the Security by the Airport Corporation not to mention violates our</p>
<p>International Aviation Treaty and Obligations?</p>
<p>(2) Can the Minister inform this House whether or not the Acting Managing Director’s</p>
<p>term has been lawfully extended by NEC for a further three months as required by law under</p>
<p>the Civil Aviation Act?</p>
<p>(3) If so, can the Minister inform this House if the Acting Managing Director has</p>
<p>qualified and met the mandatory prerequisites listed under Section 147 (a) (f) Subsection (4) of</p>
<p>the Civil Aviation Act, which the Acting Managing Director must certify before appointed for</p>
<p>a further three-month period, one of which is the fit and proper person certification by CASA</p>
<p>amongst others?</p>
<p>(4) Can the Minister inform this House when will the substantive position for Managing</p>
<p>Director of National Airport Corporation be formally advertised so that a suitable candidate</p>
<p>can be finally appointed to the position to help restore public confidence and stability at the</p>
<p>National Airport Corporation?</p>
<p>Because it oversees a lot of multimillion-kina projects in terms of airport developments</p>
<p>and related infrastructures.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to thank the</p>
<p>Honourable Member for his series of questions in relation to NAC. I will do my utmost best to</p>
<p>answer these questions. But if he wishes to have specific information, please forward a written</p>
<p>request through my office and I am happy to respond to it on the Floor of Parliament.</p>
<p>In relation to NAC Board, as you know the Marape-Rosso Government has made</p>
<p>amendments to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Act in December last year. In which it gives</p>
<p>the minister the initial authority to respond to adverse situations like the one we experienced in</p>
<p>NAC where you have an acting managing director not following the rules and requirements</p>
<p>provided by CASA and the constitution of NAC.</p>
<p>Page 15:</p>
<p>So, we had some issues in relation to that which gave rise to the amendment to the Civil</p>
<p>Aviation Safety Authority Act and allows the minister to intervene and correct whatever needs</p>
<p>to be corrected with the managing director.</p>
<p>In relation to that particular amendment and the processes; at the first instances, the</p>
<p>minister under the Act and the amendment is able to install an acting managing director for</p>
<p>NAC. And same principle applies to New Sky Limited as well which comes under the same</p>
<p>arrangement.</p>
<p>If there is an extension required, then it has to go to NEC which we are in the process</p>
<p>now to have that facilitated through NEC. So, I have not made a decision as yet and likewise</p>
<p>to NEC on the extension.</p>
<p>But in relation to the NAC Board, I am making a decision on the extension and I want to</p>
<p>clarify here that the board only has the power to recommend to the minister and its up to</p>
<p>minister and NEC to make that final determination. And really not different to any other</p>
<p>statutory body where the board makes the recommendation for the minister responsible to take</p>
<p>it up with NEC to make that final determination.</p>
<p>So, we are in that process now going through and I want to assure the Member that we</p>
<p>are acting on it and the recommendations from the NAC Board has been given to the Minister.</p>
<p>10/06</p>
<p>I have looked at the recommendations itself and I have done my own review on what</p>
<p>needs to be done in the best interest of NAC. I am moving in that space and in due course, you</p>
<p>will be made aware of the final decision.</p>
<p>So, at this stage and point in time, the current Acting Managing Director, Mr Joseph</p>
<p>Tupuri will continue until NAC makes that final determination. So, right now, there’s a process</p>
<p>I need to adhere to, I have to go through PSC to get the final endorsement and from there I go</p>
<p>to NEC for the final approval. So, we are in this stage at the moment.</p>
<p>So, in relation to the NAC board having the authority to make extension not entirely, it’s</p>
<p>only a recommendation to the Minster, to the shareholder and then I'l facilitate from there on</p>
<p>in the best interest of NAC going forward.</p>
<p>In relation to the current Acting Managing Director, Mr Joseph Tupuri meeting all the</p>
<p>requirements, yes, he has met all requirements, he’s a fit and proper person. There’s no</p>
<p>argument on that and that has been recognized by or endorsed by CASA independently from</p>
<p>my input or any intervention from my part. This side has no question mark to it.</p>
<p>Page 16:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s really sad that we have a lot of politics within NAC and therefore we</p>
<p>are seeing all this negativity and the challenges with the senior management, with the Minister,</p>
<p>and it’s happening before the public space which is not good.</p>
<p>So, hopefully going forward, the Minister can impose his authority in terms of what needs</p>
<p>to be done in the best interest of NAC and the travelling public, making sure safety and security</p>
<p>is not compromised in anyway.</p>
<p>In relation to a permanent appointment to the position of managing director, we going</p>
<p>through the process again, at this stage, we have to continue with an extension of acting with</p>
<p>specific instructions for the Acting Managing Director to carry out before a final determination</p>
<p>is made. The part of the process for the acting extension will have to take place because we</p>
<p>need to advertise.</p>
<p>And as part of the process for advertising, there firstly needs to be first a vacancy on the</p>
<p>position of the managing director. So, we need to terminate the former Managing Director, Mr</p>
<p>Rex Kiponge to create this vacancy. Once the vacancy is created, we can advertise and then</p>
<p>ask for expression of interest to recruit the best person for this job.</p>
<p>The Marape-Rosso Government, wants the best person for the job. We have no time for</p>
<p>politics, we have no time for continuing interjection and interference with the government’s</p>
<p>policy of the day.</p>
<p>We have a clear mandate and focus to make sure that we deliver safety and security at</p>
<p>the highest level for our travelling public. And that is not going to be compromised by any</p>
<p>managing director going in there trying to take control and make sure their interest continues</p>
<p>while the Government can’t do much.</p>
<p>So, we have fixed everything and are moving forward in that space. Unfortunately, we</p>
<p>are not tracking as fast as expected. But that is the process that we need to follow so that’s no</p>
<p>shortcuts or fraud and we follow due process. When we reach decision making. we will get the</p>
<p>final approval.</p>
<p>Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER -— Honourable Minister, your time has lapsed.</p>
<p>Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT — Mr Assistant Speaker, my apology, if the Member</p>
<p>would like to ask me to answer any series of questions in writing, I’ll be happy to respond to</p>
<p>them specifically. But I hope that my response today has helped us all gain understanding on</p>
<p>the situation with NAC.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>
