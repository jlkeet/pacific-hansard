<p>TREATY DOCUMENT — PAPUA NEW GUINEA — REPUBLIC OF PALAU -</p>
<p>Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT (Namatanai — Minister for Transport and Civil</p>
<p>Aviation) — Mr Assistant Speaker, pursuant to statute, I present the following treaty document:</p>
<p>Treaty Document — Independent State of Papua New Guinea — Republic of</p>
<p>Palau —Agreement relating to Air Services</p>
<p>I ask leave of the Parliament to make a statement in connection with the paper.</p>
<p>Page 21:</p>
<p>Leave granted.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the document relates to the agreement between the Independent</p>
<p>State of Papua New Guinea and Government of the Republic of Palau relating to air services.</p>
<p>I would like to make this ministerial statement on behalf of the PNG Transport Sector to</p>
<p>demonstrate the Marape-Rosso Government’s Connect PNG Policy Agenda for the three</p>
<p>modes of transportations; land, sea and air, in providing that link between our domestic</p>
<p>transport connectivity with the North Pacific Aviation Regional Connectivity.</p>
<p>Palau is a tiny Micronesian Atoll State located approximately 2,338 kilometres to the</p>
<p>north-west of Port Moresby in the Northern Pacific Ocean and traveling there by air would take</p>
<p>about three hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has yet to develop bilateral relations with Palau, although some initial</p>
<p>discussions were held in 2018, when officials of our two countries met to commence</p>
<p>discussions that progressed in 2019 and in 2020, only to be caught in the inevitable effects of</p>
<p>Covid-19 and its devastating impacts which severed further plans of bringing the proposal to</p>
<p>full realization.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, although the experiences of Covid-19 were devastating, its</p>
<p>aftermath brought with it renewed hope for countries around the world including Palau, and in</p>
<p>this case, the commencement of Air Niugini’s scheduled services connecting Palau with</p>
<p>Brisbane through Port Moresby is a move in the right direction not only for Palau but also for</p>
<p>PNG in terms of promoting trade, commerce and tourism.</p>
<p>In mid last year 2022, the Australian Government through its Aid Program encompassing</p>
<p>the Pacific Island region embarked on programs targeted at addressing development gaps</p>
<p>within this geographical sites and flagged reliable air connectivity as a plight of the people of</p>
<p>Palau, which ultimately required priority towards address.</p>
<p>Thus, through the Australian Aid Program, a procurement process through public tender</p>
<p>was facilitated calling for bids from airlines domiciled within the Pacific region.</p>
<p>15/06</p>
<p>The tender was seeking airlines with capacity and good safety record to provide the</p>
<p>required air connectivity for the people of Palau. Air Niugini as PNG’s designated international</p>
<p>airline placed its bid and emerged as a successful winner of this tender process.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, specifically, the flight routes that Air Niugini was awarded the</p>
<p>contract to service are from Port Moresby to Kororo, Palau; Port Moresby to Brisbane, and</p>
<p>Page 22:</p>
<p>vice versa. And these routes shall be subsidized by the Australian Government’s Aid Program.</p>
<p>These routes shall provide more air connectivity for the people of Palau to Brisbane via Port</p>
<p>Moresby and with connections to further destinations within the region and beyond.</p>
<p>In October 2022, the Department of Transport was informed by Air Niugini about its</p>
<p>success under the connectivity tender facilitated by the Australian Government’s Department</p>
<p>of Foreign Affairs and Trade and for scheduled flights to be performed connecting this specific</p>
<p>route.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, therefore, to ensure compliance with mandatory bilateral air</p>
<p>services requirements, officials of PNG and Palau convened in Manila on the 2nd of February</p>
<p>2023, and negotiated the PNG-Palau proposed bilateral air service agreement text, ultimately</p>
<p>reaching mutual agreement. The agreement text was then initiated by respective heads of our</p>
<p>two countries after the conclusion of the negotiations.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the initial text signifies its acceptance as the agreed framework</p>
<p>connecting the two countries towards the provision of scheduled air services and is fit to</p>
<p>proceed through respective national constitutional requirements for enactment as a bilateral</p>
<p>treaty instrument.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, to comply with PNG’s constitutional requirements, an NEC</p>
<p>submission was finalized and presented by me as a sponsor seeking;</p>
<p>(a) acceptance of the initial text of the PNG-Palau Bilateral Air Service Agreement,</p>
<p>(b) approval for me to sign the instrument as the duly mandated minister,</p>
<p>(c) approval for me to present the signed instrument in Parliament for ratification in</p>
<p>accordance with Section 117(3) of the Constitution and</p>
<p>(d) for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to exchange PNG’s instruments of ratification</p>
<p>after all constitutional requirements have been met.</p>
<p>Once Cabinet approval is sought, I will have the honour to counter sign the PNG-Palau</p>
<p>Bilateral Air Service Agreement alongside my counterpart minister in Palau.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, pending the completion of the national and statutory requirements</p>
<p>necessary to formalize this agreement, it was agreed that the initial bilateral air service</p>
<p>agreement shall have provisional effect from the date of its initialling, that’s 2nd February 2023</p>
<p>until it comes into force subject to Article 21 of the agreement.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, Article 21 of the Agreement specifies that the agreement shall</p>
<p>enter into force when the parties have notified each other in writing that their respective</p>
<p>requirements for the entry into force of this agreement have been satisfied. Therefore, once</p>
<p>Page 23:</p>
<p>PNG and Palau notify each other in writing that the respective requirements for entry into force</p>
<p>of this agreement have been met, the agreement shall enter into force.</p>
<p>16/06</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, thank you for giving me the Floor to deliver this ministerial</p>
<p>statement as the Minister responsible for Transport and Civil Aviation. I now commend this</p>
<p>ministerial statement relating to the establishment of the PNG-Palau Bilateral Air Service</p>
<p>Agreement to this honourable House.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE (Tari-Pori — Prime Minister) — I move that Parliament take note</p>
<p>of this statement by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, and I would also like to</p>
<p>make few comments in support of it.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I would like to appreciate the leadership of the Minister when he</p>
<p>assumed the role as the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation. The sector was in disarray</p>
<p>but he managed to bring to the table a strong view to reorganize it.</p>
<p>We are not here to please people or to do favours for them. The work we do must be for</p>
<p>the greater good of all. The Minister was trying to raise the civil aviation sector that was in</p>
<p>disarray. He brought into picture a strong arm, mind and will to resolve and make this sector</p>
<p>work. He is slowly and surely cleaning up the place and I rise to commend his leadership in</p>
<p>this sector.</p>
<p>And speaking on the PNG-Palau Bilateral Air Service Agreement that was signed and</p>
<p>presented by the Minister in Parliament for the benefit of our understanding and appreciation,</p>
<p>Palau may seem like a small country, but let me impress on all of us that it is an important</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>Palau is located between the Philippines, Japan, PNG, Australia, Micronesia and other</p>
<p>Pacific island countries. There is a connectivity that needs to be made with Palau. Air Niugini</p>
<p>on its own, wouldn’t be able to make that connectivity. I just want to place on record the</p>
<p>appreciation for the Australian Government support. They need that connectivity to be made.</p>
<p>airlines in the region bided for this service but our national airline, Air Niugini was successful.</p>
<p>It may seem like a small connection into a small nation in the Pacific, but there is huge</p>
<p>potential for PNG in this route to benefit from tourism and travellers’ spin-offs. For instance,</p>
<p>as the route of uplifting travellers into Palau.</p>
<p>Page 24:</p>
<p>Palau and the Micronesia is an alternate tourism spot in our part of the world. The</p>
<p>connections from Australia and PNG into Palau, and hopefully down the line, will look at</p>
<p>connecting a little bit north-west from Palau into Philippines, as a request I received from the</p>
<p>President of Palau, who happens to be a good friend of mine. There is a possibility and</p>
<p>connectivity into Philippines because there is a lot of travel from Palau and the north-west</p>
<p>Pacific into Philippines, onward to China and Japan.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I just want to give comfort to this House, that this is not a wasted</p>
<p>endeavour. To maintain connectivity to Micronesia and Pacific family of nations is important.</p>
<p>They all look upon PNG as a big brother nation. Micronesia is an important part of our region.</p>
<p>We are connected by land, air and as well by the resources in the sea. The combined</p>
<p>Micronesian nations territory and the western Pacific Melanesian territory has close to 60 per</p>
<p>cent of the world’s tuna supply.</p>
<p>Making connectivity and maintaining support with the Micronesians enables our nation</p>
<p>and this small nation partnership at all levels. This may seem like a small gesture but it is very</p>
<p>important serving these Micronesia nations by linking and bringing them closer</p>
<p>17/06</p>
<p>I just want to also inform under the Minister’s watch that New-sky Pacific is an important</p>
<p>subsidiary company under the watch of the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation that is</p>
<p>now earning revenue as a result of us controlling Air traffic. The flight that passes over us,</p>
<p>Western Pacific and the Northwest Pacific especially the Micronesian countries. Through New-</p>
<p>sky, we are able to manage the skies of Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and of the Micronesian</p>
<p>nations. We want to extend our foot prints so that we can assist these small island nations in</p>
<p>their air space.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I was privileged to be part of the people at the flight control at</p>
<p>Jackson’s when we were dispatching travelers who were inbound or going out after APEC in</p>
<p>2018. And how well our young Papua New Guineans serves. It was about 20 of them,</p>
<p>professional young Papua New Guineans all under 30. They were able to shepherd in the flights</p>
<p>of the World leaders. You know all world leaders attended but they were able to dispatch them</p>
<p>professionally and there were moments up in the sky when they were finally exiting PNG</p>
<p>boundaries’ airspace and the flights were able to connect back to our flight control and bid</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea farewell, that we had handled them very well. I got goose bumps to see that</p>
<p>our own flight controllers were competent in shepherding in not ordinary flights but leaders of</p>
<p>world’s powerful economies.</p>
<p>Page 25:</p>
<p>How they were able to dispatch Russia, USA, and China flights, and we are not that bad</p>
<p>in our country. Yes, we have our challenges but as a bigger nation in the Pacific, placed</p>
<p>strategically in the middle of Pacific and Asia, you go east, west, north and south but you can’t</p>
<p>ignore the big face of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>This sort of work done by the Minister and his team to bid for us to be the flight carrier</p>
<p>into Palau but more importantly interface with Palau people, in my view has many potentials</p>
<p>that connectivity to smaller Pacific Island nations means well for us.</p>
<p>PNG will also stand to benefit from the flight flow that we are connecting from Australia,</p>
<p>PNG and Palau.</p>
<p>Let me also inform this House that we are looking at direct flights, from PNG to China</p>
<p>and also taking in the massive inbound tourists of China who want to fly into PNG to make</p>
<p>transition into deep Pacific. Pacific in Melanesia, Pacific in Polynesia and Micronesia. These</p>
<p>are part of the connectivity that we are putting in place and the Minister unbeknownst to all of</p>
<p>us is really hard at work taking charge of this important sector to ensure that our transport and</p>
<p>especially our airline sector in this instance is being served well.</p>
<p>I want to commend the Minister, small as it may be in Palau but a big step in ensuring</p>
<p>that PNG service providers or whether its airline service or associate airline support services</p>
<p>are being able to serve the regions closest to us as we mobilize support in the family of nations</p>
<p>in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER- Honourable Deputy Opposition leader.</p>
<p>Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA (Kiriwina-Goodenough) — Thank you, Mr Assistant</p>
<p>Speaker. I would like to also support this paper and the Minister, and the Prime Minister for</p>
<p>their contribution to the paper that has now been presented on behalf of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, first of all 1 want to commend the Minister. Yesterday, he</p>
<p>presented a very important paper and a very encouraging paper to this House and that is the</p>
<p>CASA paper. It shows that Papua New Guinea has developed itself in the airline industry and</p>
<p>the safety standards of Air Niugini. The bureaucrats who are in there are being very watchful</p>
<p>and it shows the great contribution this management of CASA has done in the service of our</p>
<p>industry. Therefore, the CASA must be given thumbs up.</p>
<p>The report that you have presented yesterday has brought joy and comfort to us, the</p>
<p>leaders and the travelling public.</p>
<p>Page 26:</p>
<p>18/06</p>
<p>This document today is a testament of what you have presented yesteray. Without CASA</p>
<p>doing the right thing in your report yesterday, I don’t think the Australian Government would</p>
<p>have given us the contract. Now because CASA has done the right thing today which you have</p>
<p>presented another positive report of Australia recognising Papua New Guinea, we are their</p>
<p>children because at one stage, Australia cared for us.</p>
<p>But the bigger picture here is that Australia must consider recognising the whole of the</p>
<p>Pacific. And now we have seen their true wisdom through AusAID in awarding the contract to</p>
<p>service Palau. I was fortunate enough to be on the flight from Brisbane to Port Moresby on</p>
<p>Tuesday and they announced that flight to Jacksons Airport, Port Moresby and onto Palau. And</p>
<p>I was amazed with the announcement that it was a connection flight from Port Moresby to</p>
<p>Palau. And today you have confirmed by presenting this report and its very encouraging news.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister mentioned also that it opens up new ventures into Palau and we know</p>
<p>that Palau is a small Atoll Island with some thousand people living on that Island.</p>
<p>The President of Palau is also a very strong vocal citizen of the Pacific when it comes to</p>
<p>climate change issues. I have attended certain meetings with him when I was in my capacity as</p>
<p>the minister in the past. I heard him debate strongly about the Pacific and we as the bigger</p>
<p>brother of the Pacific must also recognise our small brothers in the Pacific Regions.</p>
<p>Our planes fly to Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji and in Palau it’s a population of 18</p>
<p>000 people, therefore we must take care of them as well. Why I say this is because PNG has</p>
<p>surplus food especially vegetables in the highlands and now we open up a route that can take</p>
<p>our products there.</p>
<p>In Palau, tourism industry is really big compared to PNG and the flights into Palau is</p>
<p>mainly tourists flying in and out. Therefore, its an opportunity for us to venture into the food</p>
<p>markets. Some of the things that we can also learn as Papua New Guineans is, what are some</p>
<p>of the things small nations are performing correctly in terms of tourism that we can also adapt</p>
<p>into our country.</p>
<p>With that I want to thank the Government of Australia for this successful bid that we</p>
<p>have won where the planes are now servicing the route. I also want to thank the presence of</p>
<p>Australia not only in PNG, Solomon Islands and Fiji but have reached out further to Palau.</p>
<p>I also want to thank our government for opening this route from Australia to Palau. Which</p>
<p>gives us the courage and comfort that the next bid that comes on, PNG can put its hands up for</p>
<p>Page 27:</p>
<p>it because CASA has done a good job with the report yesterday and we have won this bid today,</p>
<p>therefore any future bid we can be successful.</p>
<p>Thank you and congratulations Minister.</p>
<p>Mr LUTHER WENGE (Morobe) — Mr Assistant Speaker, I rise to thank the Minister</p>
<p>for Transport and Civil Aviation and to respect him and give him honor as to his leadership.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I congratulated him and commended him for a job well done as a leader in making</p>
<p>sure that people working in the administration of CASA comply with the rules nationally and</p>
<p>internationally.</p>
<p>And the benefits that we gained as long as we comply with the rules and one of the</p>
<p>benefits is to create confidence not only in PNG but in the international community. That in</p>
<p>the operation of the aircraft in and outside of the country we are more capable of doing it</p>
<p>because we have a record of safety.</p>
<p>19/06</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I said yesterday that the international community will trust us</p>
<p>when we are strictly complying with the rules, trust us in the operations of the aircraft, trust us</p>
<p>in the operation of airdrome and people who work in the airdrome, trust us in relation to the</p>
<p>pilots who fly people to their respective destination in this world. That by virtues of that trust</p>
<p>many more places of destination in the world will be opened up.</p>
<p>And today, I didn’t know that you are going to present a Bilateral Treaty Agreement with</p>
<p>the country of Palau and Papua New Guinea. In relation to the transportation between Palau by</p>
<p>air to Brisbane and from Brisbane back to Papua New Guinea. That Treaty is signed between</p>
<p>the nations of Papua New Guinea and Palau. And that is one of the confidences that we have</p>
<p>gained from the people and the leadership of Palau.</p>
<p>And not just the two countries but the third country comes in, which is Australia. Which</p>
<p>sets the confidence of our management of the rules as per mentioned and complying with the</p>
<p>the CASA safety rules internally and externally. I commend you Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, we are constituted of people from Polynesia, Micronesia,</p>
<p>Melanesia and we are the indigenous people of Pacific. We lived here since time immemorial</p>
<p>before the others have come to our region like Australia and New Zealand or even to some</p>
<p>other parts in these three regional countries.</p>
<p>We are the indigenous people, we have lived here for too long. Our relationship extends</p>
<p>far and we need to encourage the promotion of our relationship; promotion that we are</p>
<p>Page 28:</p>
<p>Melanesian, Polynesian, Micronesian. We belong to one region and one people. It should be</p>
<p>promoted and what are the other better ways to do it, I think this is the way forward.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I commend the Honourable Prime Minister, James Marape and</p>
<p>few of his predecessors, Honourable Mr Peter O’ Neill, Sir Michael Thomas Somare and all</p>
<p>other Prime Ministers, they have made sure that we the Pacific are united in our common cause.</p>
<p>The common cause that we know better, our relationship and the things that hold us together</p>
<p>as a region; Micronesia, Polynesia or Melanesia.</p>
<p>Those who have come to join us the Caucasoid Australians and New Zealanders, other</p>
<p>genetical race that have come to join us, the Mongoloids, but we are the original ones in the</p>
<p>Pacific and we must tell them that we belong here and they must become part of us. One way</p>
<p>to do is to bring ourselves to each other by boat and by plane.</p>
<p>I want to commend the Government, the Honourable Prime Minister, Minister and the</p>
<p>others. This a very good bilateral treaty that has been entered into. I agree with the Opposition</p>
<p>spokesman. That we are Pacific. I went to get an admission in a New Zealand Bar, I saw the</p>
<p>market full of taro, the breadfruit leaves and fruits, aibika and tapioca, all brought in from the</p>
<p>Pacific to New Zealand. I saw it and I said, oh that’s lovely.</p>
<p>20/06</p>
<p>As the Opposition representative said, by virtue of the operation of the plane we can</p>
<p>transport our goods and feed all of the Pacific and those who have come from faraway to live</p>
<p>in the Pacific. We have taught them to eat our food and be accustomed to it. They will help us</p>
<p>to eat the food. We must promote our food that is produced in Micronesia, Polynesia and</p>
<p>Melanesia.</p>
<p>I agree with the spokesperson from the Opposition that plenty of food have been</p>
<p>produced in the Highlands; different types of vegetables that have been produced and we need</p>
<p>to transport them by air because it’s going to take a long time via sea transport. Because of the</p>
<p>continued flights during the week, we can be able to transport our food over there. Not just the</p>
<p>food, Mr Assistant Speaker, we can transport many other things.</p>
<p>The Palauans don’t know much about Papua New Guinea and what we produce here and</p>
<p>by virtue of the operations of that flight, they can come here and see what we produce here.</p>
<p>For instance, the Indonesians didn’t know about our cheesepop or that we produce the SNAX</p>
<p>biscuits. Of course when they were introduced to our SNAX biscuits it has become a very</p>
<p>delicious and favorites biscuit for them in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Page 29:</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, things like this can happen if we produce something that is good</p>
<p>for their consumption, they will come here. And also we are Pacific, we are Polynesians, we</p>
<p>are Melanesians, we are Micronesian. Papua New Guinea has a lot of land here, plenty of land</p>
<p>in Morobe Province and Nadzab is going to become an international airport. I said yesterday</p>
<p>and I would like to thank the Government for making sure that it eventuates in the future very</p>
<p>shortly.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, we must give them land and make this Papua New Guinea colorful,</p>
<p>not just full of Melanesian people, but Micronesian and Polynesian mix them all up so that they</p>
<p>look different and nice. So we should give them land here so they can come and make business</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Secondly, it makes it easier for the tourists, when we have tourists coming from the</p>
<p>international community into Papua New Guinea. When they come to realize that there is such</p>
<p>as route between these two countries they will want to travel. They can come transit here and</p>
<p>spend some of their money here and then fly direct to Palau from here or to Australia.</p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, with the greatest respect, we don’t stop there, we can fly direct to</p>
<p>Vanuatu, Kiribati and then to Tahiti. They have been influenced by the French people, but the</p>
<p>Polynesians, Melanesians we are part of the Pacific Islands so flights must not only stop in</p>
<p>Palau but must be extended to other Pacific nations so the world will know that we are Pacific</p>
<p>and we are united and solid. And when you come to Papua New Guinea, you can explore other</p>
<p>countries where Papua New Guinean planes can take you. This is a very important bilateral</p>
<p>treaty that we’re going to sign and now I feel excited for myself because I know that I can take</p>
<p>a Morobean delegation to Palau and maybe leave them there and come back or maybe take</p>
<p>some from Palau and come and leave them here.</p>
<p>But this flight will make us united, as the Prime Minister said and I quite agree we have</p>
<p>to help our brothers. This flight will enable us to visit Palau and other parts of the Pacific and</p>
<p>also come to know them very well. Mr Prime Minister I will support this treaty without a doubt.</p>
<p>Mr Minister, I will support this treaty to be ratified by the Parliament Thank you.</p>
