<p>ANSWERS TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS</p>
<p>Chimbu Polytech</p>
<p>Mr DON POLYE ~- Mr Assistant Speaker, I ask leave of the Chair to respond to previous</p>
<p>questions asked by the Member for Gumine on the Gumine or Chimbu Polytech.</p>
<p>Leave granted.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I will be brief but I have a written response in detail addressing</p>
<p>the issues on the Chimbu Polytech that is established in the Gumine District. I delivered the</p>
<p>letter with the response in detail and I would like to address those questions in brief because</p>
<p>the questions were asked publicly on the Floor of Parliament.</p>
<p>The procedure is good, it is operated between the departments of Education and Higher</p>
<p>Education. Some funds were allocated to the Education Department whilst some funds were</p>
<p>parked in the Higher Education Department.</p>
<p>There was around K23 million allocated to Education Department and my colleague</p>
<p>Minister will address that with the Member. There is K20 million in the Higher Education</p>
<p>Department that is still there and about K600 000 of that was spent on technical expenditure</p>
<p>and K19 million is still there.</p>

<p>One major contract has been awarded by the Cabinet and six to seven others were</p>
<p>awarded by the District Procurement Commission, through the authority of the National</p>
<p>Procurement Commission. I have given details to the Honourable Member but the work was</p>
<p>put on hold because of the elections. Now I have instructed my department to work with the</p>
<p>Education Department to administer and implement the program. I would like to ask the</p>
<p>Member to work with us in implementing it.</p>
<p>The total money allocated by Marape-Rosso Government was K43 million, and of that,</p>
<p>only K600 000 was spent from the money allocated to the Department of Higher Education. In</p>
<p>regards to the K23 million in the National Education Department, the information I have is,</p>
<p>that money is in the trust account and it will be expended. I urge the Honourable Member, on</p>
<p>behalf of the people of Chimbu, to communicate with the Minister for Education.</p>
<p>So, the project is on foot; I have instructed them to implement the program. We will work</p>
<p>with this district and the District Procurement Commission to administer. I have given the</p>
<p>details to him to follow through, and I urge him to work with me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER -â€” Honourable Members, J suspend Parliament for lunch.</p>
<p>Sitting suspended from 12 noon to 2 p.m.</p>
