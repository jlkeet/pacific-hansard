<p>ANSWERS TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS</p>
<p>Media Development Policy</p>
<p>Mr TIMOTHY MASIU — Mr Assistant Speaker, thank you for giving me this</p>
<p>opportunity again. I also want to thank the Member for Kokopo for those series of very</p>
<p>important and good questions that need good answers, because this is what our people want to</p>
<p>know and hear.</p>
<p>(1) Clarify the intent and purposes of the Media Development Policy.</p>
<p>The intent of the draft National Media Development Policy is to establish an enabling</p>
<p>framework to recognise and develop the media sector in Papua New Guinea to support our</p>
<p>development agenda.</p>
<p>Current research and recent consultations have led us to the consolidation of four main</p>
<p>issues within the Media sector:</p>
<p>e Concerns on quality of journalism.</p>
<p>By concerns, we observed the decline of quality investigative journalism, the impact of</p>
<p>substandard reporting on the development agenda, and the concerns on conduct, ethics, and</p>
<p>accountability of journalists.</p>
<p>e Protection of journalists.</p>
<p>My Ministry through the Department of ICT is currently collating both quantitative and</p>
<p>qualitative data to verify the concerns on safety of journalists. We recognise, at the moment,</p>
<p>that there is a lack of protection mechanisms for journalists.</p>
<p>e Coordination of government information.</p>
<p>My Ministry has for the last three years been looking at options on how to reorganise</p>
<p>state-owned media outlets so that we coordinate dissemination of government information</p>
<p>better. We recognise that as a government we are lacking coordination in government</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>,        e Exclusion of SMEs.</p>
<p>The Ministry has identified that SMEs, particularly in the modern media space are not</p>
<p>recognised as professional and not given appropriate support.</p>
<p>Based on these issues, the draft National Media Development Policy identifies four</p>
<p>main objectives:</p>
<p>Page 18:</p>
<p>e Facilitate and coordinate access to information for citizens and ensuring the media</p>
<p>provides accurate, impartial, and balanced reporting on issues of public interest, including</p>
<p>those affecting marginalised or under-represented groups.</p>
<p>e Encourage media diversity and support the representation of local and regional voices</p>
<p>in media content and ownership.</p>
<p>e Ensure media organisations adhere to ethical and professional standards and promote</p>
<p>responsible journalism that respect local customs and cultures.</p>
<p>e Promote civic engagement and participation in media issues, including through</p>
<p>partnerships between media organisations, civil society groups and government agencies.</p>
<p>By promoting access to information, media diversity, and responsible journalism, the</p>
<p>policy aims to support the development of a more informed, engaged, and empowered</p>
<p>citizenry in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>(2) How will the new policy help protect and promote media freedom and enhance freedom of</p>
<p>speech?</p>
<p>Early this year, we released draft version 1 followed by a version 2 of the National</p>
<p>Media Development Policy. In both versions of the draft policy, we proposed for the re-</p>
<p>establishment of the PNG Media Council as an independent arm to represent and maintain</p>
<p>standards within the media professions.</p>
<p>The ministry maintains the view that the PNG Media Council through its self-governing</p>
<p>model is not doing enough to grow the profession and hold journalists accountable.</p>
<p>12/06</p>
<p>Through the Ministry’s proposal, the PNG Media Council would be empowered, hold</p>
<p>mainstream media outlets accountable and establish protection mechanism for journalists.</p>
<p>I want to inform Members of Parliament that we have had a consultation workshop and</p>
<p>as a result, my department is working on identifying a model where we can find common</p>
<p>grounds with all stakeholders.</p>
<p>(3) Does the new policy seek to regulate social media space; Meta, WhatsApp, et cetera?</p>
<p>I want to remind all that this policy is not about regulating but more on building capacity</p>
<p>and recognition within the media profession.</p>
<p>The department is reviewing whether to include provisions for oversight on social media</p>
<p>platforms and we will inform in version 3 of the draft policy.</p>
<p>(4) Current Status of Policy.</p>
<p>Page 19:</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, my department will be publishing a consultation report this week.</p>
<p>Following this, the consultation itself is leading us to undertake a series of nationwide survey</p>
<p>to better define our media landscape and ascertain data necessary to consolidate issues</p>
<p>highlighted in the recent consultation workshop.</p>
<p>My department is expected to be releasing version four (4) of the draft policy towards</p>
<p>the end of April. This version four will be subject to further feedback. I expect to take it to</p>
<p>Cabinet as early as May and should legislation be proposed; we should also start drafting</p>
<p>process in May.</p>
<p>This review is just like all the other reviews undertaken by this Government under the</p>
<p>leadership of our Prime Minister, Honourable James Marape, and the Deputy Prime Minister,</p>
<p>Honourable John Rosso.</p>
<p>This country will be reaching 50 years and no one has touched the media space but this</p>
<p>Government is doing it now, and I want to thank all Members of Parliament in doing this.</p>
