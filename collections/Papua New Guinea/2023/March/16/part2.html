<p>THIRD DAY</p>
<p>Thursday 16 March 2023</p>
<p>The Acting Speaker (Mr Koni Iguan) took the Chair at 10 a.m, and invited Reverend</p>
<p>Bernard Siai, Moderator of the United Church representing Papua New Guinea Council of</p>
<p>Churches, to say Prayers:</p>
<p>‘God is the King of all the earth, sing to him a psalm of praise. God reigns over the</p>
<p>nations and is seated on his holy throne. The nobles of the nations assemble, as the</p>
<p>people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belongs to God, and he is</p>
<p>greatly exalted.</p>
<p>Almighty God, we thank you that you are the King of this universe. Every leader</p>
<p>that is exalted by nations, they worship you and declare that, God, you are above</p>
<p>every god. This morning, Father we come in your presence knowing that as a nation</p>
<p>and our leaders, we have fallen short of your glory in many ways.</p>
<p>This morning, in this special occasion, we pray Father in the name of Jesus, that you</p>
<p>forgive us as your people. With the Blood of Jesus, cleanse us so that in this special</p>
<p>occasion of the dedication of our Governor-General, we do it with a righteous heart</p>
<p>so that your blessings will be upon our Governor-General.</p>
<p>Bless this hour of prayer and our dedication. We pray that the Holy Spirit will be in</p>
<p>the midst of us and our leaders, as we together as a nation with our leaders, dedicate</p>
<p>our Governor-General.</p>
<p>Holy Spirit, we ask you to fill our Governor-General, Sir Bob Dadae with wisdom,</p>
<p>understanding, discernment and knowledge. Father, we pray that you grant him your</p>
<p>favor, increase his faith and prepare him to pursue your excellence. Draw him to you</p>
<p>and cause him to know and fulfill your purposes. God, we pray that you also fill him</p>
<p>with sound and godly counsel, for without your counsel, he will not be able to</p>
<p>perform his duties as expected by our leaders and our nation as a whole.</p>
<p>We pray Father, that you will impart your wisdom and revelation to him, as he</p>
<p>performs his role as the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea. Keep his heart and</p>
<p>motives pure, willing and obedient to your will and in what he does, may he glorify</p>
<p>your name.</p>
<p>02/03</p>
<p>God, we thank you for Sir Bob Dadae. We thank you that he is one more time</p>
<p>appointed for second term knowing that he has that leadership skill and he is able to</p>
<p>perform in that particular office.</p>
<p>Page 4:</p>
<p>And this morning, God, in your presence together as a nation with our leaders we</p>
<p>bring our Governor-General to you and we dedicate him to you God. We pray for</p>
<p>your special blessing up on him.</p>
<p>We thank you that he is a man who speaks publicly about his relationship with you</p>
<p>and his faith. This morning, God, we thank you, together we stand with him and we</p>
<p>dedicate him and every one of us into your mighty hands for your use today,</p>
<p>tomorrow and for evermore, in Jesus your mighty and powerful name we offer our</p>
<p>prayers. We all say together, Amen.’</p>
