<p>APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS -</p>
<p>Motion (by Mr Rainbo Paita) agreed to -</p>
<p>That Mr Theo Pelgen be appointed member of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee</p>
<p>On Culture and Tourism.</p>
<p>Mr RAINBO P AITA - Mr Acting Speaker, thank you. I would like to thank</p>
<p>Members on both sides of the House for sitting through this session. As I stated earlier I</p>
<p>noticed some Members wanted to debate on the issue of our economy but the swearing in</p>
<p>of the Governor General is a pressing issue that is upon us tomorrow so I would like to</p>
<p>move that we adjourn Parliament to tomorrow at 1O .a.m</p>
