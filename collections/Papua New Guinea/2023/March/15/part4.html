<p>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</p>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFFA (Northern) - I seek leave of Parliament to make a personal</p>
<p>explanation.</p>
<p>Leave granted.</p>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFF A - The issues that I wish to make an explanation about are in</p>
<p>relation to news items that were run in The National newspaper on Friday 10th March 2023.</p>
<p>These are misleading news items; false reports and I wish to make some clarifications in</p>
<p>relation to these. Whilst we all appreciate the media and the very important work that they</p>
<p>do. The hard work that many of our good journalists perform, they have a responsibility to</p>
<p>report the truth because they are in a very serious position of power whereby they manage</p>
<p>information and thus influence perception.</p>
<p>Page 24:</p>
<p>This is not only in Papua New Guinea but in the region and worldwide because we</p>
<p>are now part of the global community and all the information and news items are reported</p>
<p>are carried far and wide throughout this world. On March 10, 2023, The National</p>
<p>newspaper ran a front-page news item that read 'School Girls abducted' in a very highly</p>
<p>sensational manner and it reported that four girls attending the Popondetta Secondary</p>
<p>School were abducted at the St Franciscan Anglican Brothers' retreat at the CTC ward in</p>
<p>Northern, Police say. That what it stated. The fact of the matter is and after investigations</p>
<p>by my office, the administration and the police, we found that no such incident had</p>
<p>occurred. No girls were abducted, there however was a very minor incident where students</p>
<p>who were at the retreat were accosted by one man and he was chased away by the staff at</p>
<p>the church.</p>
<p>Yet, The National, a foreign-owned newspaper just like the other daily decided to</p>
<p>run this report without carrying out its work with due diligence. For us in the province it is</p>
<p>quite disturbing and something that we would like the newspaper to correct appropriately.</p>
<p>The other item also a false report which they reported is the item in relation to my election</p>
<p>petition.</p>
<p>In that particular item the headline read; 'Governor to stand trial' and then it</p>
<p>reported that the Northern Governor Garry Juffa will stand trial on three counts of bribery</p>
<p>allegations against him and the election petition filed by his contender Jean Parkop.</p>
<p>15/02</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is; this is a petition that is going to trial. I am not going on</p>
<p>trial. I am not accused of bribery and in fact three persons have been named in this petition</p>
<p>or alleged to have committed bribery, I'm not one of those three persons. This newspaper</p>
<p>decided to report this fake news. It is now reported not only in Papua New Guinea but in</p>
<p>the region and in the world. And all of this is also reported online using the internet in</p>
<p>breach of our cybercrime laws.</p>
<p>The third fake report or false report is a letter to the editor. This is something that I</p>
<p>would like us to seriously consider, letters to the editor contain opinions of people,</p>
<p>sometimes making serious allegations that are not facts but are printed by the newspapers</p>
<p>as if they are factual. And I thought it's important that I make this clarification here,</p>
<p>especially for the print media because they have done this on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>In fact, just yesterday, they ran a front page story in relation to a statement that the</p>
<p>Treasurer made and he answered the question at a high level and from his perspective as</p>
<p>Page 25:</p>
<p>the Treasurer. He's not mandated to table specific programs on behalf of other ministerial</p>
<p>port folios that since taking office three and half years ago. This government has increased</p>
<p>the capital budget from K4.6 billion to K9.7 billion doubling funds for critical and national</p>
<p>projects that directly create jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I ask our media to make a conscious and concerted effort to be</p>
<p>factual in your reporting. Report the facts. Don't mislead our people. Don't create negative</p>
<p>perceptions based on lies, innuendos, rhetoric, without facts, without evidence. Thank you,</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
