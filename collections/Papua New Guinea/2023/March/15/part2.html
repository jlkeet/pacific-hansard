<p>SECOND DAY</p>
<p>Wednesday 15 March 2023</p>
<p>The Acting Speaker (Mr Koni Iguan) took the Chair at 1O .a.m.</p>
<p>There being no quorum present, he stated that he would resume the Chair after the</p>
<p>ringing of the Bells.</p>
<p>Sitting suspended.</p>
<p>The Acting Speaker again took the Chair at 10.55 a.m., and invited the Member</p>
<p>for Nawae, Honourable Theo Pelgen to say Prayers.</p>
<p>'We entered this world as equals, we are small, we are naked, we are pure of sin and hate.</p>
<p>We cannot be judged as our souls have not been spoiled. As we grow, we are spoiled with the</p>
<p>goodness and with the temptation of biting that forbidden fruit. Who knows for what reasons are</p>
<p>these temptations, good or evil, right or wrong, but only ourselves. We are in this House to worship,</p>
<p>praise, teach and learn.</p>
<p>We have been appointed by our people to become the servants to deliver to them what is</p>
<p>required. There is only one true spiritual judge that is always looking down upon us and the same</p>
<p>judge to greet us at the mighty gates as we walk hand in hand as equals.</p>
<p>Once again, we enter this new world and we can only wish that these gates are open for us</p>
<p>to travel into the next phase of our journey in spirit, accepted or forgiven of any wrong doing so</p>
<p>help us God. Amen.'</p>
