<h3>Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts</h3>
<p>Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts</p>
<p>(2) If PPL currently owes K800 million or so to its suppliers, how long will it take</p>
<p>for it to trade out of that difficulty and how long will it take for it to build up the value, and</p>
<p>therefore we should be able to sell it a profit.</p>
<p>I would like a commitment on this Floor this morning from the good Minister to</p>
<p>tell the people of Papua New Guinea how long it will take. Give us a time frame; is it going</p>
<p>to be six months, one year or five years? How long will it take before the people of Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea can expect the reliable power supplies that they pay for? I also understand</p>
<p>that 30 per cent of power produced by PPL is stolen by certain individuals.</p>
<p>(3) What is PPL doing to recover this power that is being stolen? What kind of</p>
<p>contracts is PPL doing with whoever it is that is currently draining the life out of this</p>
<p>country?</p>
<p>(4 ) Could the Minister provide to this House a list of all the contracts in the interests</p>
<p>of transparency and accountability so that we and the people of Papua New Guinea can</p>
<p>Page 12:</p>
<p>know? We all want to understand what is affecting PNG Power, what can be done to fix it</p>
<p>and how soon can they be fixed.</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker I would like to thank the</p>
<p>good Governor of East Sepik Province for raising these very important questions. Of</p>
<p>course, everyone has been complaining about PNG Power. I can say that we have no quick</p>
<p>answers and no quick solutions to this important national asset of ours. I'll try to answer</p>
<p>some of those questions, starting with the last question.</p>
<p>07/02</p>
<p>In relation to the kind of contracts that PNG Power has, usually under the law every</p>
<p>year it submits through Cabinet what is known as annual operating plan and that usually</p>
<p>contains schedule of contracts that entered into by PNG Power and of course the financial</p>
<p>situation. And of course, I will now seek Cabinet's approval following process then in due</p>
<p>course to present a statement to this Parliament about this very important national-owned</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is definitely not on sale now, we are not going to</p>
<p>sell this important company through a fire-sale which will result in us in getting no value</p>
<p>for an important national asset. We have the power, mechanism, and controls to work</p>
<p>together to tum this company around, which have been allowed over many years not the</p>
<p>last five years or this government took office since 2019 for this country to be in the stage</p>
<p>where it is now. Over the many years, we've allowed this company to go down this</p>
<p>pathway, we are not really proud of a company like that.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power owes various creditors substantial amounts of</p>
<p>money; two of them have actually taken PNG power to court. And I can announce to this</p>
<p>Parliament that we've reached agreement with those companies who are actually own by</p>
<p>our people. They recognized that their own national-owned company is in trouble and they</p>
<p>have agreed to allow PNG Power time to trade its way out these difficulties.</p>
<p>It is not a company that can be easily sold at fire-sales just to get out of a mess like</p>
<p>the one it is in now. So, they have allowed PNG Power to trade its way and has been making</p>
<p>payments.</p>
<p>Page 13:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, so my short answer is, in the immediate term and even in the</p>
<p>near future PNG Power will not be sold at that fire-sales prices where our people will not</p>
<p>get a decent return on this company and its assets.</p>
<p>Going back to the case of East Sepik and particularly Wewak town, it is known as</p>
<p>a sea center where PNG Power does not make any profit. That is not the only town there</p>
<p>are many others who are regarded as sea center, which PNG Power continues to try its best</p>
<p>to ensure that at least some power eventhough there's no return on PNG Power</p>
<p>investments.</p>
<p>And for those of us who maybe thinking that the way out for PNG Power is to</p>
<p>transfer ownership of those centers to them, I can tell this Parliament that the provincial</p>
<p>governments will come running back to this government for funding because most of them</p>
<p>are not making money. And PNG Power has been providing services because of</p>
<p>community service obligations.</p>
<p>And we have had difficult with reliability of power mainly from Puma who</p>
<p>continues to bully us using its dominant position in this country. It is something that we all</p>
<p>working together to make sure that we have secure and reliable power supplies. It's an</p>
<p>ongoing work in progress. I admitted there are problems, I will never deny it but this sort</p>
<p>of things take time actually to resolve and manage.</p>
<p>In relation to the issue of about 30 per cent of the power being stolen, yes, there</p>
<p>have been some instances where our own employees of PNG Power have colluded with</p>
<p>the outsiders to steal power. And on many occasions when they are having been discovered</p>
<p>and found they have been terminated on the spot.</p>
<p>It is a heavily unionist company compared to the others. The presence of union</p>
<p>comprised of about 700 members employees of PNG Power, you wouldn't believe it. So,</p>
<p>you may have read recently that PNG Power had to go to court to obtain that restraining</p>
<p>order to prevent the union from calling a strike and the National Court has granted that</p>
<p>Order. We are using that as an opportunity to stabilize the operation of the company.</p>
<p>As I said earlier in this Parliament by December this year, we should have some</p>
<p>results which we all can be proud of. It is not a company where we've ignored, we've</p>
<p>invested a lot of time, we have worked on the many issues, there's a lot of literature on this</p>
<p>company telling us what to do.</p>
<p>Very soon with the approval of the Prime Minister, there is a rescue package that</p>
<p>has been proposed to Cabinet. Cabinet should be able to approve it. Thank the good</p>
<p>Governor for asking those questions.</p>
<p>Page 14:</p>
<p>08/02</p>
<p>I am not sure if I am answering all the questions but in general, my answer to his</p>
<p>question is yes, it is a problem Company but we are not sitting back and allowing it to go</p>
<p>down further, instead we are doing everything we can to rescue it and turn it around. In</p>
<p>areas where there are key centers that are having issues, we have asked Australians to help</p>
<p>us by paying for the cost of solar power. Recently, in Dam, PNGSDP and PNG Power</p>
<p>came to an arrangement where our people in Dam can be able to enjoy reliable power</p>
<p>through solar power. We are also looking at supplying power to Wewak through the</p>
<p>installation of a solar power system but the challenge for us now is to identify suitable</p>
<p>State-owned land which we can then use to restore the much-needed solar power. The solar</p>
<p>power system will then be able to complement the energy that is provided by the diesel</p>
<p>generators.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power had an arrangement with a company,</p>
<p>I should not mention its name because it's a company which had a dominant position in</p>
<p>providing diesel-powered gensets to PNG Power. We have recognized that they were</p>
<p>overcharging, there was collusion between employees and that company and we have</p>
<p>slowly phased them away, so as soon as we have our own money we will then be able to</p>
<p>buy our own generators.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I have assured the good Governor and the people of Papua New</p>
<p>Guinea that this government is doing everything to make sure this company comes back to</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
