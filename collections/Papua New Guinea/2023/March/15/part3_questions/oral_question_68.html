<h3>Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts</h3>
<p>Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts</p>
<p>(2) If PPL currently owes K800 million or so to its suppliers, how long will it take</p>
<p>for it to trade out of that difficulty and how long will it take for it to build up the value, and</p>
<p>therefore we should be able to sell it a profit.</p>
<p>I would like a commitment on this Floor this morning from the good Minister to</p>
<p>tell the people of Papua New Guinea how long it will take. Give us a time frame; is it going</p>
<p>to be six months, one year or five years? How long will it take before the people of Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea can expect the reliable power supplies that they pay for? I also understand</p>
<p>that 30 per cent of power produced by PPL is stolen by certain individuals.</p>
<p>(3) What is PPL doing to recover this power that is being stolen? What kind of</p>
<p>contracts is PPL doing with whoever it is that is currently draining the life out of this</p>
