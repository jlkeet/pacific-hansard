<h3>National Development Bank</h3>
<p>National Development Bank</p>
<p>Mr SAM BASIL JNR- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed</p>
<p>to the Minister for State-owned Enterprises. We have the SME credit scheme of K200</p>
<p>million that stated in 2019 till today. My people of Bulolo district are more dependent on</p>
<p>alluvial gold operations, agriculture and PMV s.</p>
<p>(1) Can the good Minister advise us whether the National Development Bank</p>
<p>(NDB) has allocated funds for lending to each district or province?</p>
<p>(2) My district has no NDB office, therefore, can they open a branch that can serve</p>
<p>Menyamya, Wauwaria and Kaintiba also Marawaka and part of the Huon Gulf?</p>
<p>(3) Are the people ofBulolo and others throughout the country eligible for the NDB</p>
<p>SME loans as we are not seeing it on the ground?</p>
<p>(4) Could NDB have specific loan tailored to alluvial mine under the SME Credit</p>
<p>Scheme?</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I would like to thank</p>
<p>the very good Member for Bulolo for this very important questions.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the Marape Government had recognized the importance of</p>
<p>SMEs in the economic development of our country and it quite rightly and correctly</p>
<p>allocated K200 million in its budget two years ago.</p>
<p>10/02</p>
<p>Of that K200 million, Kl 00 million was allocated to Bank of South Pacific to</p>
<p>provide as a guarantee to encourage that bank to go down the path of helping us and to</p>
<p>provide loans to SMEs as well as other Papua New Guinea-owned businesses. And from</p>
<p>that balance of K 100 million, K20 million was allocated to the Department of Commerce</p>
<p>Page 17:</p>
<p>where on a number of occasions during those times at least Kl million was given to most</p>
<p>of the electorates, who requested for to help them with their SME programs.</p>
<p>The balance ofK80 million was allocated to the NDB and then NDB came out and</p>
<p>quite clearly in the media shared out the guidelines for our people to follow when applying</p>
<p>for loans.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we must all understand that when the bank says it will lend</p>
<p>money to the people, the people on their part also have to meet the requirements, nothing</p>
<p>is free in life. And the Government had honourable intentions and allocated K80 million</p>
<p>strategically for SMEs including our people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.</p>
<p>There was a special allocation for those operating SMEs in that part of our country and as</p>
<p>long as our people are able to follow the guidelines, they can be able to access those funds.</p>
<p>I'm advised by the CEO ofNDB that the K80million was allocated right throughout</p>
<p>the country and that they've run out of those funds and now it is up to us in this government</p>
<p>and this parliament to ensure that we then in the next budget allocate more money for our</p>
<p>people. It is not only the function of myself as minister, or the prime minister to allocate</p>
<p>money. This is something we all have to work together and ensure that we allocate enough</p>
<p>money for our people.</p>
<p>In response to the question of whether money can be allocated for alluvial mining,</p>
<p>the idea of existing SMEs is to ensure that money is allocated to all our Papua New</p>
<p>Guineans who involve in all sectors of business including alluvial mining and there is</p>
<p>nothing stopping our landowners from trying to have access to be used for alluvial mining.</p>
<p>So, when there are funds that are available, we can all encourage them to apply for and</p>
<p>ensure that our people get help in terms of loans. So, there is no specific provision for</p>
<p>alluvial mining business people to be allocated money but the money is meant for our</p>
<p>people who are involved in the general SMEs.</p>
<p>So, I understand also Mr Acting Speaker, that the NDB has some internal funds</p>
<p>from its savings which is now allocated to continue to help fund our people so I am sure</p>
<p>there is money there. It is a matter of our people making sure that they approach the bank</p>
<p>representatives. Unfortunately, NDB will not be present in every centre of this country. It</p>
<p>is present in more specific areas. Our people must make the effort to travel there themselves</p>
<p>and apply for the loan and of they qualify for the loan, there should be nothing stopping</p>
<p>them from benefitting from those funds. Mr Acting Speaker, thank you.</p>
