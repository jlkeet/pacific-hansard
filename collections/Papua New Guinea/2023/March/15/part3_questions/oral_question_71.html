<p>some of those questions, starting with the last question.</p>
<p>07/02</p>
<p>In relation to the kind of contracts that PNG Power has, usually under the law every</p>
<p>year it submits through Cabinet what is known as annual operating plan and that usually</p>
<p>contains schedule of contracts that entered into by PNG Power and of course the financial</p>
<p>situation. And of course, I will now seek Cabinet's approval following process then in due</p>
<p>course to present a statement to this Parliament about this very important national-owned</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is definitely not on sale now, we are not going to</p>
<p>sell this important company through a fire-sale which will result in us in getting no value</p>
<p>for an important national asset. We have the power, mechanism, and controls to work</p>
<p>together to tum this company around, which have been allowed over many years not the</p>
<p>last five years or this government took office since 2019 for this country to be in the stage</p>
<p>where it is now. Over the many years, we've allowed this company to go down this</p>
<p>pathway, we are not really proud of a company like that.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power owes various creditors substantial amounts of</p>
<p>money; two of them have actually taken PNG power to court. And I can announce to this</p>
