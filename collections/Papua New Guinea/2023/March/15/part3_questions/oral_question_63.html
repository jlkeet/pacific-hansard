<p>have been complaining quite loudly and it's only fair that these questions be put to the</p>
<p>Minister on the Floor so that he can explain to the people of Papua New Guinea, what the</p>
<p>issues are and how quickly they can be fixed.</p>

<p>Now my understanding from East Sepik is that our current generators have been</p>
<p>hired from someone, perhaps 15 years ago. So PPL is paying for the hire of these machines</p>
<p>to supply power to East Sepik. I understand also that in other parts of the country there are</p>
<p>private power suppliers and these private power suppliers sell power to PNG Power at a</p>
<p>Page 11:</p>
<p>rate of about 33 toea per kilowatt. PNG Power then on sells the power for domestic uses at</p>
<p>around 60 to 70 toea per kilowatt and to commercial users at 90 toea per kilowatt. So it</p>
<p>enjoys a healthy growth margin, from what's it's supposed to pay and from what it on sells.</p>
<p>From my own recent investigations, I could be wrong and stand corrected in the</p>
<p>House, is that PNG Power currently owes all its suppliers approximately K600 - K800</p>
<p>million in debts which it is unable to pay? One of those suppliers is currently in Court</p>
<p>seeking restitution from PNG Power.</p>
<p>I want to also go on the record and appreciate the work of the Minister for State</p>
<p>Enterprises in the last few weeks where he directed Kumul Holdings which is the owner of</p>
