<h3>Closure of companies in PNG</h3>
<p>Closure of companies in PNG</p>
<p>Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA - Mr Acting Speaker, recently, we have seen in</p>
<p>the media the closure of many companies operating in PNG. Today, we have heard some</p>
<p>good news from the Minister of Education. My concern is in regards to what he mentioned.</p>
<p>He said, every three years they will look at those companies. My questions are as follows;</p>
<p>(1) Why can't they do the books every year, so that we make certain that we deal</p>
<p>with the pertaining issues already with the current suppliers?</p>
<p>We have not addressed the issues that have been affecting us and we have gone</p>
<p>ahead to deal with the new 32 SME groups.</p>
<p>(2) What assurance do we have, that these 32 will perform better than the previous</p>
<p>group?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have existing companies who are capable of doing the job</p>
<p>better. They have the capacity and yet we want to get the new 32 groups. We have reputable</p>
<p>companies like Theodist, Moore Printing and Stationary, and Seeto Kui Stationary. They</p>
<p>have been operating in Papua New Guinea for a very long time. They have been here since</p>
<p>Adam was a boy.</p>
<p>Now we want to give it away to people who have got no experience at all.</p>
<p>Page 7:</p>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFF A - Point of Order! That is misleading. They were not here</p>
<p>since Adam was a boy. I just want to clarify that.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Governor, your point of order is out of</p>
<p>order. Honourable Deputy Opposition Leader, do not make a statement to debate on what</p>
<p>you are trying to ask. Get straight to your point.</p>
<p>Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA - My question is; are these companies fit and</p>
<p>proper to operate? Papua New Guinea needs to have consistent suppliers with reputation</p>
<p>to operate. The millions that we are spending belongs to our people. Thank you, Mr Acting</p>
<p>Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr JIMMY UGURO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. In the past, there were</p>
<p>only four contractors contracted to our four regions. Our government has now increased</p>
<p>the contractors to 32 to operate in the country.</p>
<p>We are monitoring and assessing them for their performance. As I have said, this</p>
<p>is the last contract. From this year onwards, we are going to give opportunities to provinces.</p>
<p>We encouraged those suppliers and the reputable contractors that you have mentioned, to</p>
<p>also apply when the positions are advertised.</p>
<p>The Minister does not give out contracts. There is a process that we follow, and</p>
<p>NEC always has the last say on a contract being given. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
