<h3>In response to the question of whether money can be allocated for alluvial mining,</h3>
<p>In response to the question of whether money can be allocated for alluvial mining,</p>
<p>the idea of existing SMEs is to ensure that money is allocated to all our Papua New</p>
<p>Guineans who involve in all sectors of business including alluvial mining and there is</p>
<p>nothing stopping our landowners from trying to have access to be used for alluvial mining.</p>
<p>So, when there are funds that are available, we can all encourage them to apply for and</p>
<p>ensure that our people get help in terms of loans. So, there is no specific provision for</p>
<p>alluvial mining business people to be allocated money but the money is meant for our</p>
<p>people who are involved in the general SMEs.</p>
<p>So, I understand also Mr Acting Speaker, that the NDB has some internal funds</p>
<p>from its savings which is now allocated to continue to help fund our people so I am sure</p>
