<h3>Parliament that we've reached agreement with those companies who are actually own by</h3>
<p>Parliament that we've reached agreement with those companies who are actually own by</p>
<p>our people. They recognized that their own national-owned company is in trouble and they</p>
<p>have agreed to allow PNG Power time to trade its way out these difficulties.</p>
<p>It is not a company that can be easily sold at fire-sales just to get out of a mess like</p>
<p>the one it is in now. So, they have allowed PNG Power to trade its way and has been making</p>
<p>payments.</p>
<p>Page 13:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, so my short answer is, in the immediate term and even in the</p>
<p>near future PNG Power will not be sold at that fire-sales prices where our people will not</p>
<p>get a decent return on this company and its assets.</p>
<p>Going back to the case of East Sepik and particularly Wewak town, it is known as</p>
<p>a sea center where PNG Power does not make any profit. That is not the only town there</p>
<p>are many others who are regarded as sea center, which PNG Power continues to try its best</p>
<p>to ensure that at least some power eventhough there's no return on PNG Power</p>
<p>investments.</p>
<p>And for those of us who maybe thinking that the way out for PNG Power is to</p>
<p>transfer ownership of those centers to them, I can tell this Parliament that the provincial</p>
<p>governments will come running back to this government for funding because most of them</p>
<p>are not making money. And PNG Power has been providing services because of</p>
<p>community service obligations.</p>
<p>And we have had difficult with reliability of power mainly from Puma who</p>
<p>continues to bully us using its dominant position in this country. It is something that we all</p>
<p>working together to make sure that we have secure and reliable power supplies. It's an</p>
<p>ongoing work in progress. I admitted there are problems, I will never deny it but this sort</p>
<p>of things take time actually to resolve and manage.</p>
<p>In relation to the issue of about 30 per cent of the power being stolen, yes, there</p>
<p>have been some instances where our own employees of PNG Power have colluded with</p>
<p>the outsiders to steal power. And on many occasions when they are having been discovered</p>
<p>and found they have been terminated on the spot.</p>
<p>It is a heavily unionist company compared to the others. The presence of union</p>
<p>comprised of about 700 members employees of PNG Power, you wouldn't believe it. So,</p>
<p>you may have read recently that PNG Power had to go to court to obtain that restraining</p>
<p>order to prevent the union from calling a strike and the National Court has granted that</p>
<p>Order. We are using that as an opportunity to stabilize the operation of the company.</p>
<p>As I said earlier in this Parliament by December this year, we should have some</p>
<p>results which we all can be proud of. It is not a company where we've ignored, we've</p>
<p>invested a lot of time, we have worked on the many issues, there's a lot of literature on this</p>
<p>company telling us what to do.</p>
<p>Very soon with the approval of the Prime Minister, there is a rescue package that</p>
<p>has been proposed to Cabinet. Cabinet should be able to approve it. Thank the good</p>
