<p>is the last contract. From this year onwards, we are going to give opportunities to provinces.</p>
<p>We encouraged those suppliers and the reputable contractors that you have mentioned, to</p>
<p>also apply when the positions are advertised.</p>
<p>The Minister does not give out contracts. There is a process that we follow, and</p>
<p>NEC always has the last say on a contract being given. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
