<p>Provide Financial Report of PPL</p>
<p>(1) Being that as it is, can the Minister furnish a financial report to this House so</p>
<p>that all members and the people of Papua New Guinea can appreciate the financial position</p>
<p>ofPPL?</p>
<p>I understand that Kumul Holdings is trying to build up the balance sheet of PPL so</p>
<p>that it can sell it some point at a profit. Now I want to know how long that process is going</p>
<p>to take.</p>
