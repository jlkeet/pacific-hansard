<p>Record spending in this year is projected to be about K24.5 billion, of course you are saying</p>
<p>that the record spending will deliver the growth but, Mr Acting Speaker, those records</p>
<p>spending is not helping struggling families. The household assistance package of Kl .1</p>
<p>billion that the Treasurer had announced is not helping families to put food on the table. It</p>
<p>Page 19:</p>
<p>is only assisting fuel prices to be subsidized for people who own cars and those who are</p>
<p>able to afford to have those luxury items. It is certainly not putting food on the table for</p>
<p>young Papua New Guinean families and many of them who are struggling to even have a</p>
<p>job. So, Mr Acting Speaker, can the Treasurer tell us how this assistance program will</p>
<p>assist our families throughout the country.</p>
