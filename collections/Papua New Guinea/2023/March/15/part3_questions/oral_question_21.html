<h3>Mr Acting Speaker, we have existing companies who are capable of doing the job</h3>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have existing companies who are capable of doing the job</p>
<p>better. They have the capacity and yet we want to get the new 32 groups. We have reputable</p>
<p>companies like Theodist, Moore Printing and Stationary, and Seeto Kui Stationary. They</p>
<p>have been operating in Papua New Guinea for a very long time. They have been here since</p>
<p>Adam was a boy.</p>
<p>Now we want to give it away to people who have got no experience at all.</p>
<p>Page 7:</p>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFF A - Point of Order! That is misleading. They were not here</p>
<p>since Adam was a boy. I just want to clarify that.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Governor, your point of order is out of</p>
<p>order. Honourable Deputy Opposition Leader, do not make a statement to debate on what</p>
<p>you are trying to ask. Get straight to your point.</p>
