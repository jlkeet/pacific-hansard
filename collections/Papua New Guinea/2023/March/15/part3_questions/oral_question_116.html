<p>With all these borrowing, Mr Acting Speaker, what will be our debt to GDP ratio?</p>
<p>I think your estimates of 53 per cent for the year end will be surpassed thinking that it will</p>
<p>Page 20:</p>
<p>go up close to 60 per cent. Mr Treasurer, if you can inform this honourable House the debt</p>
<p>to GDP ratio that you are going to achieve as per your budget estimates of 2023.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, with the Treasurer borrowing from IMF; can he confirm that</p>
<p>we are probably the third or fourth country in the world to ask IMF for help after Sri Lanka</p>
<p>and Pakistan. Now K3.2 billion over the next three years comes with conditions and this is</p>
<p>not an assistance to support a budget Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
