<h3>Status of the Economy</h3>
<p>Status of the Economy</p>
<p>Mr PETER O'NEILL-Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, and thank you for giving</p>
<p>me this opportunity to ask a few questions to our good treasurer, the Honourable Ian Ling</p>
<p>Stuckey, on a few things about the economy.</p>
<p>In recent times, Mr Acting Speaker, the treasurer has announced that our economy</p>
<p>is doing very well. He has projected that the economy will grow by 3.5 per cent this year</p>
<p>when rest of the world is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I just want to ask the treasurer these questions:</p>
<p>(1) Where is this growth coming from? Because the rest of the country and the</p>
<p>economy is struggling to perform, businesses are shutting down, and most of our exports</p>
<p>- coffee, cocoa, fisheries, forestry are all on the decline. So, what is driving the growth that</p>
<p>you are saying that we are experiencing in this country?</p>
<p>11/02</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I feel that, this is in my view, the growth is driven by LNG</p>
<p>exports. When LNG exports are enjoying a very high global prices as a result it is seen as</p>
<p>PNG economy is doing well, but I can assure that the economy is certainly not doing well.</p>
<p>A lot of people are unemployed and of course that leads me to the second question.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, in recent times the Treasurer had announced that they have</p>
<p>created over 10 thousand jobs over the last three years. Now, can the Treasurer inform this</p>
<p>House and the country which sectors have delivered those 10 thousand jobs, whether they</p>
<p>are in Fisheries or Forestry or Agriculture; please inform this Honourable House so that we</p>
<p>can know where the growth is because suddenly on the ground, a lot of people are finding</p>
<p>it hard to find new jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure you that people, especially our school leavers who</p>
<p>are not properly skilled are facing a lifetime of unemployment and that means that in their</p>
<p>life time they might never get a job. So, Mr Treasurer, can you please inform this</p>
<p>Honourable House about where this job growth that we are going to experience.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the third question is about expenditure and the Treasurer has</p>
<p>proudly stated over many locations that this government is making record spendings.</p>
<p>Record spending in this year is projected to be about K24.5 billion, of course you are saying</p>
<p>that the record spending will deliver the growth but, Mr Acting Speaker, those records</p>
<p>spending is not helping struggling families. The household assistance package of Kl .1</p>
<p>billion that the Treasurer had announced is not helping families to put food on the table. It</p>
<p>Page 19:</p>
<p>is only assisting fuel prices to be subsidized for people who own cars and those who are</p>
<p>able to afford to have those luxury items. It is certainly not putting food on the table for</p>
<p>young Papua New Guinean families and many of them who are struggling to even have a</p>
<p>job. So, Mr Acting Speaker, can the Treasurer tell us how this assistance program will</p>
<p>assist our families throughout the country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the other question that I want to ask is about inflation. The</p>
<p>Treasurer proudly announces on many occasions that the inflation in our country is at 6.3</p>
<p>per cent which is much lower than average long-term inflation of about 7 per cent. That's</p>
<p>what he's announcing.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, but the real prises in the store goods is a very different story</p>
<p>Mr Treasurer. In 2019, the price of bully beef was at Kl 1.90 and today it is about K20. So,</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I don't know where the calculation of inflation is coming from and I</p>
<p>know I've got confidence in our public servants at our National Statistical Office but the</p>
<p>reality on the ground is different.</p>
<p>How is the Treasurer developing this tragedy to address inflationary issues in the</p>
<p>country? Why I ask this question is because, Mr Treasurer, for many Central Banks around</p>
<p>the world to curb the raising of inflation around the world, the interest rates have been</p>
<p>increased around many global economies which is trying to curb the inflation increases.</p>
<p>Whereas in PNG, the strategy adopted by the Central Bank and Treasury is to have a steady</p>
<p>and unchanged interest rate regime. Now, if you maintain an interest rates at that level,</p>
<p>how are you going to curb inflation from continuing to grow? So, Mr Acting Speaker, that</p>
<p>is my question on inflation and interest rates.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, my sixth question that I want to ask is; now the Treasurer has</p>
<p>announced publicly that he has allowed International Monetary Fund to come in and</p>
<p>introduce a program in PNG after 20 years. Now, reading through, we are going to borrow</p>
<p>an additional K3 .25 billion over the next 3 years.</p>
<p>12/02</p>
<p>Now, before I ask questions in relation to the International Monetary Fund, the</p>
<p>Treasurer in his statement has confirmed that last year in December, he borrowed Kl.8</p>
<p>billion from the Australian Government. This year he will borrow another Kl .5 billion in</p>
<p>addition to the K3 .25 billion that will be borrowed from IMF.</p>
<p>With all these borrowing, Mr Acting Speaker, what will be our debt to GDP ratio?</p>
<p>I think your estimates of 53 per cent for the year end will be surpassed thinking that it will</p>
<p>Page 20:</p>
<p>go up close to 60 per cent. Mr Treasurer, if you can inform this honourable House the debt</p>
<p>to GDP ratio that you are going to achieve as per your budget estimates of 2023.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, with the Treasurer borrowing from IMF; can he confirm that</p>
<p>we are probably the third or fourth country in the world to ask IMF for help after Sri Lanka</p>
<p>and Pakistan. Now K3.2 billion over the next three years comes with conditions and this is</p>
<p>not an assistance to support a budget Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Can he confirm that this is a bail out because our economy is struggling to meet</p>
<p>revenue targets you have set Mr Treasurer? Mr Treasurer can you confirm also that the</p>
<p>conditions that IMF has put which is on the schedule that you have presented to this House</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker. These conditions include; (1) is that they will make changes to the</p>
<p>Central Bank Act.</p>
<p>Can you confirm or deny that these changes will include what they call flexible</p>
<p>foreign exchange policy?</p>
<p>Does that mean that they will review the valuation ofkina and are going to devalue</p>
<p>our kina?</p>
<p>The second issue is that; they are saying that new tax measures from IMF and its</p>
<p>on your attachment, Mr Acting Speaker. This House needs clarity and detail as to why you</p>
<p>have an obligation to this honourable House and the country.</p>
<p>What are the new tax measures that we are talking about? Are we going to put more</p>
<p>burden on our people and are you going to increase salaries and wages tax? Are you going</p>
<p>to increase company tax and what are the new measures?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, why I asked all these questions is because they are also</p>
<p>proposing that we need to restructure our public service machinery. And that's the third</p>
<p>condition that they are putting. How many more people are you going to terminate in the</p>
<p>public service machinery so that you can have savings to fund your budget?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, that is what they are trying to achieve. When you read what</p>
<p>they have put to you then you will understand. They touched on staffing and remuneration</p>
<p>guidelines, which they are referring to people who are struggling on the street to feed their</p>
<p>families.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, these borrowings come with very serious conditions</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Member, I will interrupt your questions.</p>
<p>Our question time has lapsed and you have raised many important questions already. Can</p>
<p>you get straight to the question and let the Minister respond?</p>
<p>Page 21:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr PETER O'NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, I will finish shortly but all these</p>
<p>questions are touching the economy and everybody's life in this country. We are talking</p>
<p>about eight to ten million people and how they are going to survive when all these economic</p>
<p>conditions come.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, IMF is renowned around the world.</p>
<p>Mr Don Po lye - Point of Order! I think for ordinary members of Parliament, to ask</p>
<p>such detailed questions like this is another issue. But for someone who was the former</p>
<p>Prime Minister of a Government before that created some of these problems, he should tell</p>
<p>what programs did he put in place to address the same issues because we are trying to solve</p>
<p>the problem that he created, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>(Members interjecting)</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Member your Point of Order is out of</p>
<p>order. I have asked the member to ask his questions. I will allow him to summaries his</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>13/02</p>
<p>Mr PETER O'NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, I know the good Member for Kandep</p>
<p>loves to intervene and talk, but he should realize that the last time IMF was in this country,</p>
<p>both of us were still in government. That was over 20 years ago and our people suffered</p>
<p>from that. When the Somare Government was in power, we have never dealt with IMF</p>
<p>because of these kind of conditions.</p>
<p>We survived without IMF so learn to live within your means. What we are trying</p>
<p>to tell you, is to provide us with proper details so that we can have a good debate about</p>
<p>issues that are confronting our nation. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Point of Order! Mr Acting Speaker, I appreciate you</p>
<p>managing questions on the Floor of Parliament. Members of Parliament, and especially</p>
<p>senior members, must not use question time to make statements.</p>
<p>Page 22:</p>
<p>The former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia wants to debate on the</p>
<p>Treasurer's statement from yesterday. I will be re-opening_t hi-sw ith a statement in-reply.</p>
<p>That will be the opportunity for him to make his statement.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, please control members of Parliament who discuss and use</p>
<p>question without notices as opportunity to make statements. I ask members that if you are</p>
<p>men enough to ask questions, or point to a matter that is of national importance, be men</p>
<p>enough to sit through and listen to all responses. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>(Members interjecting)</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia, resume your</p>
<p>seat and I will make a ruling on your question.</p>
<p>(Members interjecting)</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable members, upon advice, the questions that</p>
<p>the Honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia have asked, is before Parliament. And whatever</p>
<p>statements that relates to a bill that is before Parliament, ministerial statements, would not</p>
<p>be raised on question.</p>
<p>Therefore, I made the ruling that the Minister will not respond to the questions</p>
<p>asked by the Member for Ialibu-Pangia. The honourable Member's questions can be</p>
<p>reserved for when the debate on this Bill comes.</p>
<p>(Members interjecting)</p>
<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - Point of Order! Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I</p>
<p>understand that the honourable Member had asked his questions within question time. I</p>
<p>should be allowed to respond to it, even though, they are very convoluted.</p>
<p>I would want to address this matter because it is of national importance and because</p>
<p>he has misled this Parliament and the people of this country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I need to correct him.</p>
<p>(Members interjecting)</p>
<p>Page 23:</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Minister, upon advice on your point of order. I have</p>
<p>already made a statement that the matter is before Parliament; No:27 and it will come on</p>
<p>during this session.</p>
<p>14/02</p>
<p>Therefore, I can allow for you to explain on that, when the bill notice is called, I</p>
<p>can give you time to respond to the question asked by the Member.</p>
<p>Right now, I cannot allow you to answer because according to the Standing Orders,</p>
<p>we cannot debate on that or respond to a question on that. So, when the bill is called, I will</p>
<p>allow for you to make your statement in response to the question.</p>
<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - So to clarify, you would like me to correct his very</p>
<p>wrongful assertions that he raised this morning during the response to my statement.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honorable Minister, please resume your seat as I have</p>
<p>already made my ruling and I will give you time when this matter is called before</p>
<p>Parliament.</p>
