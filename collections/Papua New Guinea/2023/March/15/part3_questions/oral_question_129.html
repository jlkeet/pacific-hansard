<p>Mr PETER O'NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, I know the good Member for Kandep</p>
<p>loves to intervene and talk, but he should realize that the last time IMF was in this country,</p>
<p>both of us were still in government. That was over 20 years ago and our people suffered</p>
<p>from that. When the Somare Government was in power, we have never dealt with IMF</p>
<p>because of these kind of conditions.</p>
<p>We survived without IMF so learn to live within your means. What we are trying</p>
<p>to tell you, is to provide us with proper details so that we can have a good debate about</p>
<p>issues that are confronting our nation. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Point of Order! Mr Acting Speaker, I appreciate you</p>
