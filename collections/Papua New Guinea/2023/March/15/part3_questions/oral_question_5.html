<h3>(3) Why is this project taking too long?</h3>
<p>(3) Why is this project taking too long?</p>
<p>I ask these questions because m people and the affected areas of Moro be Province</p>
<p>especially those in Markham and those in Obura/Wonenara electorate have been</p>
<p>anticipating and expecting this project. The government has not come clear as to when this</p>
<p>project will commence. It is not fair to keep the people waiting when nothing is coming</p>
<p>forth. Please I want answers for these questions.</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM DUMA -Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. Thank you, Member for</p>
<p>Kainantu for asking these important questions. The Ramu2 Hydro-electric project is about</p>
<p>$940 million Dollars so that would be about K3.2 billion and was initiated back in 2016.</p>
<p>To date KCH which owns PNG Power has spent close to K60 million to conduct the normal</p>
<p>hydrological engineering cost management analysis and all other studies associated with</p>
<p>it, in getting a huge hydroelectric scheme off the ground.</p>
<p>It has taken a long time for the project components including PNG Power to</p>
<p>develop this project. Thanks to the Government of Prime Minister Marape, who in late</p>
<p>2009 a Power Purchase Agreement was signed between the project proponents and PNG</p>
<p>Power. In 2021 the Project Implementation Agreement was signed between the Governor</p>
<p>General representing the state and the developer. This project has progressed to such a</p>
<p>stage where on the 28 November 2022 this government authorized Treasury to issue a</p>
<p>normal state guarantee. Not those guarantees that you find in other projects but the normal</p>
<p>state guarantee that will protect the interest of the state to support this project.</p>
<p>Page 9:</p>
<p>And discussions are being held between KCH, PNG Power and the department of</p>
<p>Treasury for the issue of the state guarantee. Once the state guarantee is issued it will pave</p>
<p>the way for the project proponents to reach a financial closure. Once that is done then they</p>
<p>will negotiate with the Wafi/Golpu Mine to sign an off-take agreement that will underpin</p>
<p>the economics of this project.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is owned by this country and it is important that</p>
<p>we on both sides of this House support this project. It is a project where the long-suffering</p>
<p>landowners of Eastern highlands and their provincial government are the people who have</p>
<p>been supplying power from the Yonki-Hydro Dam. They have not received many benefits</p>
<p>from the government for over many years since the operating this project in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>This time around, this government under the leadership of Prime Minister Marape</p>
<p>has recognized the contribution made by the people of eastern highlands and it has decided</p>
<p>to allow in addition free equity to be given to the eastern Highlands Provincial Government</p>
<p>and the shareholders for 20 per cent of that project. Another 20 per cent equity to the people</p>
<p>of Moro be who then will host the Wafi/Golpu.</p>
<p>This is the first time any government has recognized the people contributing to</p>
<p>power through the hydro-electric project.</p>
<p>05/02</p>
<p>And in addition the government has about K 10 million in development grants for</p>
<p>the affected landowners. So, very soon once the guarantee has been signed, I can assure</p>
<p>you the good Member that representatives from KCH and PNG Power will then approach</p>
<p>the Morobe Provincial Government and the affected landowners, the Eastern Highlands</p>
<p>Provincial Government and the landowners to sign their project benefit agreements.</p>
<p>So Mr Acting Speaker, it is a build, owned and operated transfer agreement that</p>
<p>will enable the developer who will be spending about K3.2 billion to recover his investment</p>
<p>and then transfer ownership to PNG which will own only 60 per cent and then the Morobe</p>
<p>and Eastern Highlands Provincial governments and landowners will own the balance.</p>
<p>It's a first project where provincial governments and the affected landowners and</p>
<p>the state will own joint-ownership. Hopefully it will pave way for future projects to follow</p>
<p>that precedence where our people are active participants in very important resource projects</p>
<p>like this.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure the good Member that we are nearly there, it's not</p>
<p>too late. As soon as we have signed the guarantee and project laws has been reached, then</p>
<p>Page 10:</p>
<p>construction hopefully will commence. And the landowners and the provincial</p>
<p>governments will be invited to participate in those spin-off activities while waiting for the</p>
<p>construction to take place. And then once ownership has then been transferred, they will</p>
<p>then be equity owners, free-carry the equity after 25 years.</p>
<p>So I can assure the good member that we are doing everything we can to progress</p>
<p>this very important resource project. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFFA - Mr Acting Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal</p>
<p>explanation perhaps after question time as I am mindful that members may want to ask</p>
<p>questions. I stood yesterday but I was not recognised so today I am asking if I can be given</p>
<p>the opportunity to do that. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER-Honourable Governor of East Sepik, I will ask you to</p>
<p>raise your question but before that let me respond to the Honourable Governor of Northern.</p>
<p>I will direct the Clerk to report to you and you can inform him on your matter and we will</p>
<p>fit you into the schedule of the session.</p>
<p>Mr ALLAN BIRD - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, my question is directed to the</p>
<p>hardworking Minister for State Enterprises.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, this is in relation to the constant blackouts and the issues</p>
<p>affecting PNG Power Limited. To preface my question, over the last couple of months, we</p>
<p>have been experiencing series blackouts all across the country. And whilst we have been</p>
<p>experiencing blackouts for the last 15 years or so, it's actually become worse in recent</p>
<p>times.</p>
<p>I think Papua New Guineans everywhere including in my province of East Sepik</p>
<p>have been complaining quite loudly and it's only fair that these questions be put to the</p>
<p>Minister on the Floor so that he can explain to the people of Papua New Guinea, what the</p>
<p>issues are and how quickly they can be fixed.</p>
<p>06/02</p>
<p>Now my understanding from East Sepik is that our current generators have been</p>
<p>hired from someone, perhaps 15 years ago. So PPL is paying for the hire of these machines</p>
<p>to supply power to East Sepik. I understand also that in other parts of the country there are</p>
<p>private power suppliers and these private power suppliers sell power to PNG Power at a</p>
<p>Page 11:</p>
<p>rate of about 33 toea per kilowatt. PNG Power then on sells the power for domestic uses at</p>
<p>around 60 to 70 toea per kilowatt and to commercial users at 90 toea per kilowatt. So it</p>
<p>enjoys a healthy growth margin, from what's it's supposed to pay and from what it on sells.</p>
<p>From my own recent investigations, I could be wrong and stand corrected in the</p>
<p>House, is that PNG Power currently owes all its suppliers approximately K600 - K800</p>
<p>million in debts which it is unable to pay? One of those suppliers is currently in Court</p>
<p>seeking restitution from PNG Power.</p>
<p>I want to also go on the record and appreciate the work of the Minister for State</p>
<p>Enterprises in the last few weeks where he directed Kumul Holdings which is the owner of</p>
<p>PPL to pay for the fuel to keep our provinces running even though they are still rationing</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>Now the Minister stated just recently in answer to another question that this</p>
<p>company is owned by the people of Papua New Guinea.</p>
