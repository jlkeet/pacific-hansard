<p>Provincial Government and the landowners to sign their project benefit agreements.</p>
<p>So Mr Acting Speaker, it is a build, owned and operated transfer agreement that</p>
<p>will enable the developer who will be spending about K3.2 billion to recover his investment</p>
<p>and then transfer ownership to PNG which will own only 60 per cent and then the Morobe</p>
<p>and Eastern Highlands Provincial governments and landowners will own the balance.</p>
