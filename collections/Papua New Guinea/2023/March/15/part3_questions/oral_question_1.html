<h3>Contracting SME's to Deliver School Supplies</h3>
<p>Contracting SME's to Deliver School Supplies</p>
<p>Mr PATRICK BASA - Good morning, Mr Acting Speaker, and the Prime</p>
<p>Minister, Governors and the colleague Members of Parliament. My question is in regards</p>
<p>to the contracts for the supply of school materials and I therefore direct it to the Education</p>
<p>Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, Waigani Department of Education chooses to use SMEs to</p>
<p>distribute important materials when schools have already started and well into the first</p>
<p>term.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, schools everywhere are struggling mostly those in the rural</p>
<p>communities and remote locations like my district in Kabwum.</p>
<p>02/02</p>
<p>Many cannot coup with increased number of students enrolled, problems with late</p>
<p>transfer of teachers and even the remote schools there is no teachers at this stage and very</p>
<p>poor infrastructures and so on.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, hearing about another million-kina worth of contract for the</p>
<p>supply of materials. I want to ask the Minister the following questions.</p>
<p>(1) Why can't the supply of school materials be done by the respective provincial</p>
<p>education boards in collaboration with the district education authorities and the district</p>
<p>leaders like us?</p>
<p>(2) Minister are you aware that this arrangement of using selected SMEs have</p>
<p>failed in the past?</p>
<p>(3) What is the criteria for selecting the SMEs and do they have capacity to cover</p>
<p>the remotest schools like in Kabwum?</p>
<p>(4) Minister can you give an undertaking to provide an audit report on the</p>
<p>procurement of these contracts and present a report to the Parliament for our comments?</p>
<p>Mr JIMMY UGURO - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the Member for</p>
<p>Kabum for his good questions, regarding the school supplies and the commodity</p>
<p>component of the school supply throughout the country.</p>
<p>This has been an ongoing program which was initiated by the previous governments</p>
<p>and we are continuing on it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, this contract was awarded to a company in 2017, which</p>
<p>was a two-phase contract which commenced work in 2017 and ended in 2022. But starting</p>
<p>Page 6:</p>
<p>this year, the Government has decided to allow the 22 provincial government with the</p>
<p>engagement of SMEs in each province to consider taking the contract. We will do an</p>
<p>advertisement shortly for all SMEs in all provinces to apply for the contracts.</p>
<p>As I stated in the annual report in 2021, that for the first time our government</p>
<p>recognizes about 32 SMEs to take part in a contract totaling K27 million to the local</p>
<p>distributors. A K74 million contract has been signed by the supplier and we have sub</p>
<p>contracted 32 SMEs throughout the country to distribute the school materials throughout</p>
<p>the provinces. And it's on going and few other provinces have yet to receive these supplies.</p>
<p>But we are closely monitoring our local SME contractors which some have already</p>
<p>delivered on the distribution and some not yet.</p>
<p>But, I have instructed the department to carry out an audit on it and I will make sure</p>
<p>it's properly done. I have also instructed the department for an audit report on how these</p>
<p>contracts have been awarded to these local distributors.</p>
