<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we must all understand that when the bank says it will lend</p>
<p>money to the people, the people on their part also have to meet the requirements, nothing</p>
<p>is free in life. And the Government had honourable intentions and allocated K80 million</p>
<p>strategically for SMEs including our people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.</p>
<p>There was a special allocation for those operating SMEs in that part of our country and as</p>
<p>long as our people are able to follow the guidelines, they can be able to access those funds.</p>
<p>I'm advised by the CEO ofNDB that the K80million was allocated right throughout</p>
<p>the country and that they've run out of those funds and now it is up to us in this government</p>
<p>and this parliament to ensure that we then in the next budget allocate more money for our</p>
<p>people. It is not only the function of myself as minister, or the prime minister to allocate</p>
<p>money. This is something we all have to work together and ensure that we allocate enough</p>
<p>money for our people.</p>
