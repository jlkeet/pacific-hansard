<p>PNG economy is doing well, but I can assure that the economy is certainly not doing well.</p>
<p>A lot of people are unemployed and of course that leads me to the second question.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, in recent times the Treasurer had announced that they have</p>
<p>created over 10 thousand jobs over the last three years. Now, can the Treasurer inform this</p>
<p>House and the country which sectors have delivered those 10 thousand jobs, whether they</p>
<p>are in Fisheries or Forestry or Agriculture; please inform this Honourable House so that we</p>
<p>can know where the growth is because suddenly on the ground, a lot of people are finding</p>
<p>it hard to find new jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure you that people, especially our school leavers who</p>
<p>are not properly skilled are facing a lifetime of unemployment and that means that in their</p>
<p>life time they might never get a job. So, Mr Treasurer, can you please inform this</p>
<p>Honourable House about where this job growth that we are going to experience.</p>
