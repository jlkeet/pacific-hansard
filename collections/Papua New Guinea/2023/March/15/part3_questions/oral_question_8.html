<h3>Promote Police Officers</h3>
<p>Promote Police Officers</p>
<p>Mr GABRIEL KAPRIS - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are</p>
<p>directed to the Minister for Internal Security and I would like the Prime Minister to take</p>
<p>note.</p>
<p>As we all know Law and Order is a priority one to address and my short questions</p>
<p>are in regard to the Police command and control structure that is being implemented by .the</p>
<p>Department of Police throughout the country.</p>
<p>In East Sepik, we have a problem with the command structure. The Police</p>
<p>personnel that run the district have to be qualified officers at the Inspector or Senior</p>
<p>Inspector ranks to be able to conduct police work in the respective districts. Maprik District</p>
<p>Page 15:</p>
<p>has been without a senior police inspector for some good years and it is now affecting the</p>
<p>law and order situation.</p>
<p>We have regular hold-ups along the Sepik Highway right through to Nuku/Lumi</p>
<p>and we have had a number of deaths but the Police personnel are not able to address the</p>
<p>situation because they have an issue with the command control. A junior officer cannot</p>
<p>give commands to the other officers because they are in the same rank and this has been</p>
<p>affecting the performance of the Police personnel in my province.</p>
<p>(1) Can the Minister look at promoting the officers who are qualified and are able</p>
<p>to be promoted to Senior Inspector?</p>
<p>I want you to give special attention to Maprik as it has been without a Senior</p>
<p>inspector for a long time.</p>
<p>(2) Can the Minister look at other Police Personnel who have logged their</p>
<p>applications to the Head Office, Human Resource Department, to be considered and</p>
<p>appointments be made?</p>
<p>09/02</p>
<p>That is my question, Mr Acting Speaker, if the Minister can respond accordingly. I</p>
<p>will need answers and get a senior inspector to Maprik as soon as possible. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr PETER TSIAMALILI - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. I also thank the</p>
<p>member for Maprik for his valid questions. I think I will again re-emphasize on our Police</p>
<p>Force that we are manpower stretched. At the same time I heard your question in</p>
<p>particularly to the instance where you have witnessed an officer who is not performing</p>
<p>his/her duties in terms of command and control. That is something at the operational level.</p>
<p>The COP and our good Deputy Commissioner for operations including our ACPs in the</p>
<p>provinces are strongly looking at and are reviewing. It is not just in Maprik, I think it is all</p>
<p>across our country.</p>
<p>In our recent discussions with our good governors there were some discussion about</p>
<p>how we can empower the provinces a lot more which will empower the districts too. We</p>
<p>are looking at some reforms that I would like to implement this year 2023 to address those</p>
<p>gaps. Coming back to your situation in Maprik, my good Member, I will ask the Cop</p>
<p>Commissioner to look into it. As it is, it is an operational matter where I can go directly to</p>
<p>you and see how we can help you to better manage your law and order space.</p>
<p>Page 16:</p>
<p>I guess that is across all of us. Again, I will re-emphasize, the PPCs were</p>
<p>specifically asked to have a dialogue or consultation with each district to develop plans.</p>
<p>Those are some of the areas that you will have to highlight within your plans on the</p>
<p>challenges that you are facing so it is reflected in your plan. I will emphasize again, that</p>
<p>your plan is very important and in your plan you will highlight those challenges. The</p>
<p>Member for Maprik I take heed of your question so I can talk directly with you to find</p>
<p>solution for the situation that you are facing. Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
