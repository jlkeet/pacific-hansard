<p>there is money there. It is a matter of our people making sure that they approach the bank</p>
<p>representatives. Unfortunately, NDB will not be present in every centre of this country. It</p>
<p>is present in more specific areas. Our people must make the effort to travel there themselves</p>
<p>and apply for the loan and of they qualify for the loan, there should be nothing stopping</p>
<p>them from benefitting from those funds. Mr Acting Speaker, thank you.</p>
