<h3>Power project in Eastern Highlands Province</h3>
<p>Power project in Eastern Highlands Province</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM HAGAHUNO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions</p>
<p>are directed to the Minister for State Enterprises.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the much talked about $890 million Ramu 2 Hydro-power</p>
<p>Project is located in the Eastern Highlands Province. It is between my electorate, the Obura</p>
<p>- Wonenara electorate and your electorate. Our people have prepared and have been</p>
<p>waiting for this project to materialised for the last 19 years.</p>
<p>This is a big project, and apart from the Ramu 1 Project, which my people have not</p>
<p>been receiving much benefit from, this project proposes to give free equity to the Morobe</p>
<p>Provincial Government and the landowners, as well as the Eastern Highlands Provincial</p>
<p>Government and the landowners.</p>
<p>Page 8:</p>
<p>This has come as a relief to the landowners, who have been silently providing and</p>
<p>generating power to develop Papua New Guinea. That is for the two Momase provinces</p>
<p>and the five highlands provinces.</p>
<p>04/02</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have been waiting and this is one of five highlands</p>
<p>provinces and it is one of the single biggest projects. And as long as the Ramu river keeps</p>
<p>flowing and as long as we continue to exist, this project will continue to bring benefits to</p>
<p>this nation. My questions are;</p>
<p>(1) When will PNG power sign the agreements with the Provincial</p>
<p>Governments and the landowners for this very important project?</p>
<p>(2) When will this important resource project Ramu2 Hydro-power project</p>
<p>commence?</p>
