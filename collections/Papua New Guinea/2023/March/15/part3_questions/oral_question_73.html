<p>Governor for asking those questions.</p>
<p>Page 14:</p>
<p>08/02</p>
<p>I am not sure if I am answering all the questions but in general, my answer to his</p>
<p>question is yes, it is a problem Company but we are not sitting back and allowing it to go</p>
<p>down further, instead we are doing everything we can to rescue it and turn it around. In</p>
<p>areas where there are key centers that are having issues, we have asked Australians to help</p>
<p>us by paying for the cost of solar power. Recently, in Dam, PNGSDP and PNG Power</p>
<p>came to an arrangement where our people in Dam can be able to enjoy reliable power</p>
<p>through solar power. We are also looking at supplying power to Wewak through the</p>
<p>installation of a solar power system but the challenge for us now is to identify suitable</p>
<p>State-owned land which we can then use to restore the much-needed solar power. The solar</p>
<p>power system will then be able to complement the energy that is provided by the diesel</p>
<p>generators.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power had an arrangement with a company,</p>
<p>I should not mention its name because it's a company which had a dominant position in</p>
<p>providing diesel-powered gensets to PNG Power. We have recognized that they were</p>
<p>overcharging, there was collusion between employees and that company and we have</p>
<p>slowly phased them away, so as soon as we have our own money we will then be able to</p>
<p>buy our own generators.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I have assured the good Governor and the people of Papua New</p>
<p>Guinea that this government is doing everything to make sure this company comes back to</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
