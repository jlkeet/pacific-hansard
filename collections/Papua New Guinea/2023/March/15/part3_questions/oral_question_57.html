<p>too late. As soon as we have signed the guarantee and project laws has been reached, then</p>
<p>Page 10:</p>
<p>construction hopefully will commence. And the landowners and the provincial</p>
<p>governments will be invited to participate in those spin-off activities while waiting for the</p>
<p>construction to take place. And then once ownership has then been transferred, they will</p>
<p>then be equity owners, free-carry the equity after 25 years.</p>
<p>So I can assure the good member that we are doing everything we can to progress</p>
