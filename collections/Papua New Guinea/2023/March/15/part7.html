<p>MINISTRY OF TREASURY - ECONOMIC UPDATE -</p>
<p>Resumption of debate (f rom 14 March 2023) - Leader of Government Business, in</p>
<p>continuation).</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE (Tari-Pori - Prime Minister) - Thank you, Mr Acting</p>
<p>Speaker. I just want to apologise to the Chair for interrupting a process during Question</p>
<p>Page 26:</p>
<p>time. I just felt that Parliament must maintain decorum. Question time must be short, sharp</p>
<p>precise and to the point. Matters that relate to debate be refrained from to the best of our</p>
<p>ability and be discussed in debate and the matters that the Member for lalibu-Pangia raised</p>
<p>are very important and are in response to our economy and in response to a statement that</p>
<p>our Treasurer made yesterday on the status of our economy on job creation and everything</p>
<p>that relates to the health of our country's economy. Therefore, it is prudent that we bring</p>
<p>this matter up for debate in the next few minutes so that the country fully appreciates.</p>
<p>Sometimes in a world of misinformation, especially fuelled by politics, the ugly</p>
<p>head of politics does appear in our society, in social media, in commentaries in the media</p>
<p>proper but correct information is important to assist our people, our country, our economy</p>
<p>to be encouraged that we are moving at a right place.</p>
<p>16/01</p>
<p>The Treasurer must be commended. Anybody can run an economy in good times.</p>
<p>Our Treasurer must be commended because he steered our country's economy in four hard</p>
<p>years - period; on record. I mentioned four hard years, Mr Acting Speaker because when</p>
<p>we took Government in 2019, the economic fundamentals were so weak, it was eroded.</p>
<p>The former Prime Minister knows very well the economic conditions passed over</p>
<p>to my Government. I was his Finance Minister. The reason why I resigned was because of</p>
<p>his appetite for unhealthy and unsustainable debt. He is least qualified to talk about</p>
<p>managing the economy and I just give you one pointer, I reminded him already on this</p>
<p>Floor of Parliament. What was the rational of going to a Credit Suisse commercial bank</p>
<p>and borrowing with a two-year repayment rate at 8.8 per cent in 2018? When you talk about</p>
<p>the economy's liquidity drying up. In 2018, there was a clearest evidence that we were at</p>
<p>the precipice, we were falling into an economic abyss that we could not step out from.</p>
<p>So Mr Acting Speaker, when we talk, we talk with context to allow the economy to</p>
<p>regrow and the Treasurer is in the jump seat at the moment. Let's give him full support to</p>
<p>ensure that he runs the economy to bring our country to a balanced budget at the very</p>
<p>earliest. We anticipate by 2027 and a 13-year road map to bring our country out of the</p>
<p>bondage of debt that we have carried for so long. These debts precede O'Neill's</p>
<p>Government', and precedes Somare's Government. These are part of our national debt</p>
<p>profile that we've been carrying since 1975 when we started off, when our economy was a</p>
<p>Kl billion economy.</p>
<p>Page 27:</p>
<p>And I just want to encourage this House, our National Parliament and our country.</p>
<p>We are trying our absolute best in these tough times. You only have to look at the statistics</p>
<p>of our budget delivery. Our budget delivery is not all debt-driven budget. Our budget</p>
<p>delivery; a substantial majority of it is funded by our internal revenue. On record IRC is</p>
<p>collecting much better today than they have ever collected in the past. In fact, at a much</p>
<p>higher level'</p>
<p>Last year, IRC collected around K13 billion and that's a record. On average, before</p>
<p>IRC was collecting below Kl0 billion. Customs likewise is collecting above K3 billion.</p>
<p>On record, Customs has never collected above K3 billion. These are collected in tough</p>
<p>times. Increasing efficiency by appointing good people, we are starting to see better</p>
<p>performance in our internal revenue sector and IRC is doing very well, Customs is doing</p>
<p>very well. We are not only assisted by the high oil price. We are assisted by the increased</p>
<p>efficiency within and our budget support that is carrying the economy.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker there are some good news, we've seen an increase in export</p>
<p>from agriculture, starting 2021.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, I returned from East New Britain over the weekend. In East New</p>
<p>Britain, away from oil and gas dependency, away from mining dependency is an economy</p>
<p>that has been running on agriculture and forestry - especially sustainable forestry.</p>
<p>Look at the 500 people now employed in a new veneer plant that we commissioned</p>
<p>in 2021. Two years, on we have 500 new people employed in remote Lassul LLG in the</p>
<p>Baining part of the Gazelle Electorate. So these are evidential work happening in tough</p>
<p>times going forward.</p>
<p>17/02</p>
<p>The last four years, Mr Acting Speaker, when our Government we arrived in 2019,</p>
<p>we inherited weak economic fundamentals, then in 2020, Covid-19 arrived in PNG and</p>
<p>induced a global economic shutdown. The effect carried on into 2021 and yet we had the</p>
<p>General Election coming up in 2022. We had to be expansionary but within responsible</p>
<p>budget approach.</p>
<p>The Treasurer has a clear road map before us. The result of the road map assisted</p>
<p>with very cheap concessional US dollar denominated borrowing where we were able to</p>
<p>retire 2019 at the K18.956 billion expenditures We retired 2020 at the K19.398 financial</p>
<p>expenditures. We retired 2021 at the K20.131 billion financial expenditures. We retired</p>
<p>2022 at the K23.374 money expenditure.</p>
<p>Page 28:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the sum of all these is over K81 billion being spent in our</p>
<p>economy in the last three going four years. You ask me what is the result of these spending,</p>
<p>well our public servants are paid on time like never before. I speak as former Finance</p>
<p>Minister there were days when public servants were paid behind because Waigani public</p>
<p>accounts had no liquidity. And the former Prime Minister knows that how he runs through</p>
<p>his friends at Central Bank asking for treasury bill and inscribe stock to be printed.</p>
<p>We deliberately choose to move a way from treasury bill and inscribe stock going</p>
<p>to cheaper US dollar denominated borrowings that had zero per cent at long-term five-year</p>
<p>grace period. This is the Treasurer's track record in the last five years. Collecting debt</p>
<p>financing as well as internal revenue raise financing on time delivering an K81 billion in</p>
<p>the last three or four years of expenditures in our country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the net result is this, our economy grew from K79.6 billion</p>
<p>when we took over from 2018 to a Kl 13 billion as listed by World Bank and IMF.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, you ask me how does the macro statistic deal with everyday</p>
<p>person? Our disbursement through our districts and provinces over the last four years, we</p>
<p>have given K4.4 billion to our districts and provinces. If nothing is happening on the</p>
<p>ground, members of Parliament, those who came in today, you ask the former members of</p>
<p>Parliament. Our people out there, if nothing is happening on the ground, go to Ombudsman,</p>
<p>Finance Department, Reporting Department in DIRD.</p>
<p>But as far as National Government is concern and for instance, speaking from Tari</p>
<p>perspective, my district received K15 million each for the last three years. I have five</p>
<p>contractors running work in my district. These contractors employ 200 up to 500 persons</p>
<p>each at any time depending on the scope of work.</p>
<p>So Mr Acting Speaker, when someone asks me, 'how many jobs have you created?</p>
<p>The DSIP, PSIP program directly or indirectly has put over 10,000 people in employment,</p>
<p>not just in Port Moresby where foreign workers were pushing wheelbarrow like it was in</p>
<p>the last eight years, but in all parts of our country including the Oppositions' district. We</p>
<p>were fair enough to give money to them.</p>
<p>You ask all members of Parliament, they have employed through their district and</p>
<p>provinces. Employment programs that are running through the contractors, especially local</p>
<p>contractors who are beneficiaries to government disbursements. Their worked has been out</p>
<p>there through the DSIP, PSIP program nation wide with the 100 per cent foot print, we</p>
<p>have created over 10,000 jobs directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Page 29:</p>
<p>I come to bills at the Works Department, we have today over 274 road contractors</p>
<p>running through consistent funding including retiring over K2 billion worth of contract the</p>
<p>O'Neill Government gave never funded on record. Ask the Works Secretary, he will</p>
<p>confirm this. In fact, he came out to media already. We've delivered and retired outstanding</p>
<p>contracts valued over K2 billion, and including today, over K4 billion worth of contract</p>
<p>that is running.</p>
<p>18/02</p>
<p>All these 274 Contractors are employing Papua New Guineans because our</p>
<p>government chooses to engage more local contractors - SME type of contractors, than the</p>
<p>previous government which was very friendly to contractors from outside coming in to</p>
<p>work in our country.</p>
<p>Contracts at the Department of Works and other State issued contracts have created</p>
<p>over 10,000 jobs as a medium-term or immediate-term stop-gap approach to keeping our</p>
<p>people engaged and employed so our economy is lubricated with kinas going to their pay</p>
<p>packets and our people engaged in our economy.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, not only this, but for the first time, our generation of leaders</p>
<p>on this side have invested money into SME Programs. On record, since 2020, this is the</p>
<p>first leadership team that has invested money into SME Programs. You can go to BSP or</p>
<p>NDB and they will give you indications that these SMEs are borrowing cheap concession</p>
<p>funds at six per cent to ensure that they have start-ups and their business is supported. So,</p>
<p>the SME funds, we are providing and these businesses will be directly or indirectly creating</p>
<p>employment out there in the market to advance the cause of SME, especially our focus on</p>
<p>agriculture and downstream processing in our country. We put money to support freight</p>
<p>subsidy, we have put money for price support and to add to this area of focus. we have put</p>
<p>money this year for state equity and additional land acquisition to support businesses in our</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, our government knowing very well where we are led by the</p>
<p>Treasurer, has made clear investment choices to diversify away from total reliance and</p>
<p>mining and move into other aspects of our economy which we feel can have a greater</p>
<p>catchment of our people and bring the majority of our people into economic involvement</p>
<p>not just for today but more importantly for our future.</p>
<p>Our focus on downstream processing remains our number one area. You may not</p>
<p>know it yet, Members of Parliament and the Member for Ialibu-Pangia, but things are</p>
<p>Page 30:</p>
<p>turning around. I point to you all to my trip to Lasull, who would have given them a fair</p>
<p>chance, aren't they not Papua New Guineans? The Bainings, are locked out there in the</p>
<p>bush forever.</p>
<p>The Honorable Jelta Wong and I arrived in 2021, and today 500 Bainings are</p>
<p>employed for the first time and this is the story that I would like to tell.</p>
<p>I would like to commend all the Governors and Members of Parliament who are</p>
<p>working with us to advocate and move quickly into downstream forestry, downstream</p>
<p>agriculture, and downstream fisheries.</p>
<p>We have invested in a program for the resuscitation of PMIZ to ensure that the</p>
<p>fisheries sector also is lifted up and processing fish catchments in our country. This has</p>
<p>been our focus and we will not deviate from it because this focus will create tens and</p>
<p>thousands of jobs directly and the spin-off beneficiaries indirectly going forward.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the Treasurer is at work. I would just want to conclude by</p>
<p>pointing to a few commentaries lately. Business Advantage is a book that's published not</p>
<p>by the Marape Government but by our business community. In their recent publication,</p>
<p>they made a few interesting observations and I would like every leader here to get a copy</p>
<p>of these observations. They did indicate the challenges of operating businesses in our</p>
<p>country and I do admit to the challenges. We will work with the manufacturing council,</p>
<p>and the business council to ensure these challenges are addressed. The hardest challenge</p>
<p>was the Forex access. Forex access was still a problem in 2018 going back to 2016.</p>
<p>19/02</p>
<p>When the economy should have been traveling to good times when LNG returns</p>
<p>was to have hit the economy and made big impact yet we choose to be hostile to our people</p>
<p>by very unworthy investments in years 2014 to 2015, that we were in government.</p>
<p>Today the business community places Forex as the number one challenge and we</p>
<p>have worked to retire this challenge. The Central Bank is now putting 100 million dollars</p>
<p>to the market every month to ensure the business community have access to Forex.</p>
<p>This was a far cry from what was a 30 million dollars threshold that Central Bank</p>
<p>had previously. Our Treasurer has brought a reform to ensure Central Bank is liberated</p>
<p>without compromising the independence, prudence and the fiduciary in their responsibility.</p>
<p>The Central Bank today reports to a board not just the Central Bank Governor doing</p>
<p>things with a Prime Minister at Paddys or Bacchus Bar.</p>
<p>Page 31:</p>
<p>(Laughter in the Chamber)</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE -That was the past, I got to admit because I was on the</p>
<p>side witnessing these conversations.</p>
<p>(Laughter in the Chamber)</p>
<p>Mr Peter O'Neill - Point of Order! For our Prime Minister to try and put in</p>
<p>question the integrity of Papua New Guinean professionals, these are career bankers you</p>
<p>know. So, you should be proud of their achievements rather than coming here mocking</p>
<p>them because you have a privilege. There are Papua New Guinean's struggling out there</p>
<p>and they need a serious answer, clear policies and programs from you. Why can't you man</p>
<p>up and do it after four years.</p>
<p>This is a matter that is of number one concern in this country, unemployment, Fo rex</p>
<p>and so forth. I am just replying to him and he is the Prime Minister of our country and he</p>
<p>has to be serious about what he is doing.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Member, you are trying to debate which</p>
<p>I can allow you time during the Grievances Debate. But for now, please allow the Prime</p>
<p>Minister to complete presenting his statement.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE -Mr Acting Speaker, point spoken, taken and responded.</p>
<p>But, let me say this in the Business Advantage, 'l 00 CEOs Response', they have made</p>
<p>some interesting findings.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Forex issue which the government has responded and today we have a</p>
<p>100 million dollars on the market every month.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, it has never been a Forex issue. I stand here today to be</p>
<p>corrected on the records of past Treasurer, past Central Bank records and past government</p>
<p>records. The average of Forex reserve under Mr O'Neill has always been at K6 to K7</p>
<p>billion in Forex. The average of late Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare was around</p>
<p>K8 to K9 billion when National Alliance was in office.</p>
<p>Today in three hard years, we have now gone past the K14 billion threshold and we</p>
<p>have eleven months of cover. It has never been a fiscal policy issue but has always been</p>
<p>monetary policy and the way Central Bank was operating. We have unbundled this and it</p>
<p>Page 32:</p>
<p>has taken some efforts but we have unbundled this carefully so that the market has Forex</p>
<p>that they require.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, to the business community, we are mindful of what you need</p>
<p>to do. And I want to encourage all our business community to assist us by partnering with</p>
<p>us, by working in the downstream processing focus. We will come to you all agriculture,</p>
<p>forestry and fisheries companies in our country.</p>
<p>First preference and priority, we will come to you all who operate and do business</p>
<p>in our country before we go elsewhere. Partners in the downstream processing space area</p>
<p>is core signature policy that differentiates between me, Mr O'Neill and others of the past.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we can no longer depend on the hype, boom and bust cycle of</p>
<p>the oil and gas and mining project.</p>
<p>20/02</p>
<p>We must move seriously into down streaming of our resources, the reason why</p>
<p>Minister Marn and the other ministers in the agriculture sector are working into that space.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, these areas will create more sustainable job for us. I want to</p>
<p>encourage the business community that have spoken, that we are listening to you. Partner</p>
<p>with us in this space as we work together for the long term sustenance of our country.</p>
<p>I want to quote from a Westpac senior economist.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Prime Minister, I will interrupt you. Your</p>
<p>20 minutes of debate has lapsed. I will allow you two more minutes to sum up.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to quote from a</p>
<p>senior Westpac economist in the same report. It says; "profit, investment and recruitment</p>
<p>expectations have improved with recruitment sediment at a record high." This is from</p>
<p>Westpac, not from James Marape, high as 84.6 per cent from 56.8 per cent in 2022.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we are not imbeciles running this country. We have learnt from</p>
<p>the past mistakes. We are diversifying our economy and are empowering all parts of our</p>
<p>country. We are working and the Papua LNG feed was signed.</p>
<p>Within next year, FID will be announced and 10,000 jobs will be created, but we</p>
<p>want to bring this 10,000 jobs into our country. That is why Kumul Petroleum and the</p>
<p>Education Department is working with Total, to train more Papua New Guineans to work</p>
<p>in that space.</p>
<p>Page 33:</p>
<p>We have sequenced P'nyang LNG back to back from Papua. Porgera have already</p>
<p>employed 1,000 people in preparation of the reopening of the mine. When it is re-opened,</p>
<p>3,000 workers will be employed, but in better terms for our country and not the terms that</p>
<p>we were living with for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, big projects will be running but our government remains focus</p>
<p>in the downstream of our renewable resources. Don't listen to negative naysayers in the</p>
<p>media and in the Opposition, especially, the former past.</p>
<p>I will take good advice from the Opposition Leader, who has no input to our</p>
<p>country, thus far from government, he is a credible critic in the Opposition. But I will not</p>
<p>take advice from a former Prime Minister, who has had the opportunity to construct this</p>
<p>country, but ran this country for himself. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr PETER O'NEILL (Ialibu-Pangia) - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for</p>
<p>giving me this opportunity to rebut some of the misleading statements coming from a</p>
<p>sitting Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I said what I had to say about the statement from the Treasurer.</p>
<p>There are few misleading points that the good Prime Minister has raised. When we were</p>
<p>in government, we had debts. With those debts, I built the infrastructure in the country. We</p>
<p>left it with K28 billion worth of debt in the country. Today it is K53 billion.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Point of Order! Please, do not keep on misleading the</p>
<p>Parliament. It is not K28 billion, it is a K39 billion debt you left behind. IMF and Central</p>
<p>Bank have confirmed this. All that have been borrowed publicly and all that is hidden in</p>
<p>the state-own enterprises, and every other debt we are carrying were put to the table. We</p>
<p>inherited and were sitting at a K39 billion debt, which was already above 35 per cent debt</p>
<p>to GDP threshold, that Fiscal Responsibility Act allowed for.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Prime Minister, thank you for your point</p>
<p>of order. I will ask the honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia to continue with his debate.</p>
<p>Mr PETER O'NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, when the honourable Prime Minister</p>
<p>was speaking, we did not interrupt him, despite all the facts he was presenting was wrong.</p>
<p>All he has to do is to look at his own annual budget outcomes that he tabled on this</p>
<p>Page 34:</p>
<p>Parliament, to see the figures I am calling. That is the only document that we can depend</p>
<p>on, and that is the government's official position.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, today we have K53 billion worth of debt but the only</p>
<p>construction of things happening, is the so called Connect-PNG. We will see the outcome</p>
<p>of it very soon in regards to who is getting the contract, who is doing the work and who is</p>
<p>not doing the work, and who is getting paid.</p>
<p>21/02</p>
<p>Those things are now being asked by the same people that you have brought into</p>
<p>the country, the IMF. They are asking about the procurement processes and the names of</p>
<p>people who have got contracts, so it will be very interesting and we look forward to seeing</p>
<p>them working with you over the next 12 months to give you all the conditions that they</p>
<p>have listed and you have tabled on this Floor of Parliament to complied with.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by some of the things that they are saying but you know that</p>
<p>getting K3.25 billion bail from IMF is not easy. It is going to be a challenge. They are</p>
<p>going to tighten the noose and we are going to struggle to survive this is what we are</p>
<p>missing in this point. In may 2020 despite what the Prime Minister is saying, there is a club</p>
<p>in Paris called Paris Club made out of the World's most developed economies.</p>
<p>There are no Africans, Chinese or many Asians but the world's most developed</p>
<p>economies. And they suspended all the repayments of loans for PNG in May 2020. The</p>
<p>Treasurer needs to give some of the details on that to the House. Why did they suspend the</p>
<p>repayments? It is only because when we are not able to repay the loan, they suspend it so</p>
<p>they give us breathing space. When we have serious physical issues and these are all on</p>
<p>the websites that you can google and find out for yourself.</p>
<p>These are serious concerns and we can say that we have record spending and record</p>
<p>revenue here but that is not reflecting on the state of the economy. This is what we are</p>
<p>arguing about and this is what we are trying to get; the real picture of what is happening</p>
<p>on the ground. People are struggling to go and find a job or even holding onto a job that</p>
<p>they have. These are real situations when you have 10,000 going into some hotel here to</p>
<p>look for a job.</p>
<p>This is the reality that we are faced with and it is not about political point scoring</p>
<p>exercise as we are not going to the polls so we have to please anyone. Be the government</p>
<p>that is for the people, take on advice, criticisms and comments and assess why people are</p>
<p>complaining. I think when you look say we are pay 6- 8 per cent interest rates that is only</p>
<p>Page 35:</p>
<p>one loan that we got and that was the sovereign loan. and I admit that and we were advised</p>
<p>by treasury that it was the path to follow.</p>
<p>It is only US$600 equivalent to Kl .8 billion out of a K53 billion loan book that we</p>
<p>have. And you can refer to one point and of course, we could have made better decisions</p>
<p>but right now you are not getting free money. Do not come and talk about zero per cent</p>
<p>interest rate here and mislead the Parliament. Look at IMF, they are lending at 2.4 per cent</p>
<p>for 5-year grace period and 10-year loan repayment period. I do not know loan agreements</p>
<p>about the Australian loans because you have not tabled the documents on them but we have</p>
<p>checked them through the internet. And these are realities that you are not telling the nation</p>
<p>and that we are in a serious crisis. And if you do not match the revenues that you have</p>
<p>projected for this year, you will have a spending crisis, because your ability is just to</p>
<p>continue spending because you have a K24 billion budget. It is time to rein in the spending</p>
<p>and cut the non-priority areas. If we all have to make sacrifices, let us make them. The</p>
<p>country needs us to stand up for our people.</p>
<p>If we have to cut back on the things that we are doing and the excesses that we are</p>
<p>having we must cut back. IMF is a very good example, their team coming here is an</p>
<p>indication that not all is right and that is why we need to take heed of the advice that they</p>
<p>are trying to bring in. when you are going to affect the public service machinery and the</p>
<p>central bank operations, treasuries operations and introduce new tax and tax administration</p>
<p>of this country; these are serious reforms.</p>
<p>If they are asking you to do it, there are timeline to achieve before end of December</p>
<p>2023. So, this is not something that we are going to sit here and play politics about. It is</p>
<p>about the reality facing our country we are the only country apart from Pakistan and Sri</p>
<p>Lanka in this program now. That's not something we should be proud of, Mr Acting</p>
<p>Speaker.</p>
<p>22/02</p>
<p>Yes, we've had tough times, we've had Governments come and go but we all must</p>
<p>put our heads together and try and rescue ourselves from the position we are in because all</p>
<p>is not well. So I know that we are trying to bring services to our rural communities and</p>
<p>look after our own electorates but if the country is not stable and the economy is not</p>
<p>performing well we will not deliver and that is a fact.</p>
<p>So I urge the Members of Parliament, yes Prime Minister and I can carry on and</p>
<p>talk about these things, but you know it has to be factual. The reality on the ground, what</p>

<p>is happening to our people. this is not about politics, elections are finished. Accept what's</p>
<p>going wrong and put our country back on track, that's all we are asking. Thank you Mr</p>
<p>Acting Speaker</p>
<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY (Kavieng - Minister for Treasury) - Thank you Mr</p>
<p>Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to continue to debate this morning. Thank you to</p>
<p>the honorable member for some of his very convoluted and confusing questions this</p>
<p>morning. So a lot has been said this morning and a lot of it has been assumptions, very</p>
<p>wrongful ones Mr Acting Speaker and I will try my best to correct some of those and put</p>
<p>into context what our Government is trying to do</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, when I try to go through some of the questions that was asked</p>
<p>this morning, I would say the honorable member himself doesn't know how many</p>
<p>questions were asked because as he went on about asking the first three questions he started</p>
<p>making some more comments, and he sort of got out of control and he got confused as to</p>
<p>which ones of those were questions and which ones of those were lies. So let me try and</p>
<p>correct some of those today ifl may.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that some ofus in this House continue to talk down the economy</p>
<p>and create doubt in the public's mind in relation to the direction of our economy and the</p>
<p>growth of our economy. We continue to hear statements like people are suffering, families</p>
<p>are suffering, but you know no one provides any facts and the data that we have used in</p>
<p>Government and have been for nearly half a century don't support those. And I'll give</p>
<p>examples this morning</p>
<p>In relation to the question, where is growth coming from? Mr Acting Speaker, in</p>
<p>yesterday's statement, I have answered all of these through the three, four or five questions</p>
<p>that the honorable member has asked. If he spent some time reading my statement, spent</p>
<p>more time going through some of my media releases. He'd realize that I have answered all</p>
<p>of them and I would encourage him to spend more time reading my statements going</p>
<p>through the Treasury website because not only will you be a better informed member of</p>
<p>Parliament, I think you would be a better person as a result of it.</p>
<p>So in relation to growth, Mr Acting Speaker, in yesterday's statement. I mentioned</p>
<p>that the growth forecast for this year was 3.5 per cent. It's very clear, that's from the World</p>
<p>Bank, in fact the IMF I didn't mention forecast growth at 3.7 per cent. Where does this</p>
<p>come from? Because he keeps saying and insinuates that there is no growth and that could</p>
<p>not be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Page 37:</p>
<p>23/02</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, growth is calculated through monitoring nominal GDP. PNG</p>
<p>economy is broken up into 19 sectors it starts at agriculture, forestry and fisheries number</p>
<p>one oil and gas extraction, wholesale and retail trade, and I hope I can remember to respond</p>
<p>to some of the comments that were made this morning in relation to a big biscuit company</p>
<p>in Lae claiming that they were suffering. And it goes all the way down to the 19th sector</p>
<p>called water supply and waste management.</p>
<p>So if you have a look at that, Mr Acting Speaker, the way it's monitored is they</p>
<p>start off with the breakup of our GDP forecast. Last year was around about K107 billion</p>
<p>and this year, as Prime Minister has mentioned so often, is forecast to be Kl 13 billion.</p>
<p>These are just facts on how growth is estimated. So that's where it's coming from, Mr</p>
<p>Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Going through some of the very unsubstantiated questions he asked, he talked about</p>
<p>our record K24.5 billion Budget, well he got that right. We both agreed on that. And he's</p>
<p>asking how does this help families.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, if he bothered to listen yesterday he would have noticed in page</p>
<p>6 of our statement and I would like to repeat this for his purpose and also respond to his</p>
<p>comments to his former best buddy in governments gone passed, the Minister for Higher</p>
<p>Education, to give more detail. Well, yesterday, I gave you 12 pages of detailed numbers</p>
<p>and so on our record Budget and how does this help families, I did say yesterday that for</p>
<p>the first time in PNG's history our Government, the Marape Government developed a</p>
<p>package to help address some of these cost of living pressures.</p>
<p>If we all recall K587 million we pumped in and K590 million this year; a total of</p>
<p>Kl .17 million that we've given to families. No other government including your own,</p>
<p>honourable leader, has ever delivered such a household assistance package.</p>
<p>So let's stop saying that we're not trying to help our families, the facts are clear. I</p>
<p>also mentioned yesterday that the IRC had written to all employers early this year with new</p>
<p>tax schedules that will apply from the 1st of January. The other assistance that we offer are</p>
<p>that we are providing tax cuts, or the IRC are providing tax cuts of up to K63 per fortnight</p>
<p>for all of those earning K20 000 or more.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate that many more families are benefitting it was mentioned</p>
<p>in both dailies earlier this year by Nasfund, who estimated that the household package will</p>
<p>benefit over 98 000 of its members. So tens of thousands of our families are benefitting,</p>
<p>Page 38:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker. Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands so let's stop making</p>
<p>unfounded allegations like so many families are suffering. Be a little more positive, be a</p>
<p>bit more accurate, be truthful and talk about the families that are benefiting. And if that</p>
<p>was not enough and you say it's only benefiting those that earn K20 000 or more, it benefits</p>
<p>those who live in our rural areas. From the beginning of this year 1st of January</p>
<p>I also mentioned yesterday and gave a detailed report that we're also covering the</p>
<p>cost of school project fees for this year. So for example, a family no longer has to pay a</p>
<p>project fee of K220 for each of their children attending secondary school.</p>
<p>24/02</p>
<p>So, this program helps ensure that our household assistance package gets out to</p>
<p>those in the rural areas and those that need the help the most. So, that's an example of the</p>
<p>help that we are getting from this Budget and I would ask the honourable members to stop</p>
<p>downplaying some of the positive things that we are doing and be more balanced with your</p>
<p>response.</p>
<p>He then asked another question this morning to members of Parliament that this</p>
<p>year we are proposing to receive Kl .5 billion as part of our financing plan to deal without</p>
<p>deficit. Well that figure is pretty right so, we agree on that figure. And then, he also</p>
<p>mentioned the K3.25 million funding that we hope to get from the IMF in the next three</p>
<p>years. He then asked a question, what is the debt to GDP ratio when we affect these</p>
<p>particular loans.</p>
<p>So, Mr Acting Speaker, I'm very happy to assure the honourable leader, members</p>
<p>of this House and the people of our country that these financing plans that include the two</p>
<p>loans that he mentioned comply without debt control laws. So, for example, to answer</p>
<p>specifically his question on the debt to GDP which would apply over the next three years</p>
<p>so that's 2024, 2025 and 2026. Our debt to GDP focus for next year sits at 52.2 per cent,</p>
<p>2025 projected 51. 3 per cent and 2026 dropping down to 49 .2 per cent.</p>
<p>So clearly, Mr Acting Speaker, the way in which we undertake our financing plan</p>
<p>including every single loan that we take complies with our Fiscal Responsibility Act, unlike</p>
<p>during their time in government.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, when we took office in 2019, you will all recall, we had a</p>
<p>raging debate on whether the Budgets by the then government were accurate or whether</p>
<p>they were fake. The argument was resolved when finally, we asked and agreed to an</p>
<p>independent umpire and who was that? There was the IMF and their ruling were conclusive</p>
<p>Page 39:</p>
<p>and I suggest that might be the reason why a bit of bad blood started coming out with some</p>
<p>of the attitudes that we had with the IMF.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, for example, to demonstrate how a government should not</p>
<p>manage its Budget and to demonstrate how a government breaches its own law, let me just</p>
<p>give you very quickly some facts.</p>
<p>In the 2019 Budget, the previous government Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal</p>
<p>Outlook numbers on revenue, they had forecast and announced so gloriously on this Floor,</p>
<p>if I can remember sitting on the other side, that their revenue figures would be and were on</p>
<p>target to be K14 billion. We totally disagreed, if you all recall and we suggested and</p>
<p>claimed and stated it was K12.9 billion. So, then we asked IMF to intervene, they were in</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea on a country visit and they assessed the revenue was actually K13</p>
<p>billion. What does that mean? It means that the forecast by the government in relation to</p>
<p>revenue was down to K987 million. There figures were out by about a billion kina.</p>
<p>25/02</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker on expenditure, the MYEAFO figures said that it was on target</p>
<p>to reach Kl 6.3 billion. I stated clearly in that year that the figures should have been around</p>
<p>Kl 7.5 billion. The IMF stepped in as the agreed umpire and said it was Kl 7.6 billion. What</p>
<p>was this mean? The Government than expenditure figure was overspent by a record Kl .2</p>
<p>billion.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have an extraordinary situation where the government's</p>
<p>revenue was down by down by a billion kina and the expenditure was up by a billion kina,</p>
<p>was that a mistake, or was it deliberate? How could you possibly make a mistake of Kl</p>
<p>billion when you are putting together the National Budget?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, it gets worse, the deficit they said would be K2.3 billion and I</p>
<p>said as Shadow Treasurer it would be closer to K4.5 billion. Well, guess what? The IMF</p>
<p>came in and said that the deficit was actually K4.6 billion, and the government then was</p>
<p>out by K2.2 billion in their deficit.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, why I am sharing these significant figures with you is because,</p>
<p>I will now get to the point because my friend likes to talk about debt to GDP so let's just</p>
<p>compare our records, the Marape-Rosso Government with the O'Neill Government.</p>
<p>The O'Neill Government MYEAFO than from debt to GDP, they estimated it was</p>
<p>sitting at 31.8 per cent, and if you recall our ceiling was 40 per cent so on paper as this</p>
<p>Parliament was being told they were within our debt control ceiling. We said from the</p>
<p>Page 40:</p>
<p>Opposition that it was actually in a serious breach at 41. 2 per cent and guess what? The</p>
<p>IMF umpire said it was 41.3 per cent. So, the government then was in clear breach of our</p>
<p>debt control laws.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, what do we do? The Marape-Rosso Government had to clean</p>
<p>up that mess. We came in, restructured the budget, and were faced for the first time</p>
<p>undertaking a budget cut which we elected to be Kl.132 billion which we were forced to</p>
<p>make so that we could comply with the Debt Control Laws. Then we were criticized for</p>
<p>making these Budget cuts and as a result, we had to make some loans and were criticized</p>
<p>for it but we were paying off their loans. It is a difficult world, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, Mr Acting Speaker, just to demonstrate to you the difference between the</p>
<p>Marape-Rosso and the other government on how we managed not just the economy but</p>
<p>specific items like debt to GDP. I also noticed that there was a question asked whether</p>
<p>embarking on a three-year IMF Program is a bailout.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I want to categorically deny that the Marape-Rosso</p>
<p>Government is undertaking a three-year IMF-funded program because it's a bailout. The</p>
<p>former Prime Minister gave some examples of countries how not to copy when we are</p>
<p>managing our economy and I agree with him but can I repeat again, I am starting to repeat</p>
<p>a little bit more than I like.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, as has suggested the main reasons why countries embark on an</p>
<p>IMF Program is because they are experiencing economic stress and economic duress,</p>
<p>specifically they normally had a balance of payment problem but both circumstances do</p>
<p>not apply to Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>26/02</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I say that because if you look at our balance of payments I</p>
<p>shared with the Australian Government during our ministerial forum, our balance of</p>
<p>payments at the end of 2021, the last available figure was set around K4 billion. Our current</p>
<p>account balance of payment was around a record ofK19 billion.</p>
<p>So, Mr Acting Speaker, I'm quoting his favourite institution, the Central Bank that</p>
<p>he always likes quoting I'm using the same figures so we both agree there.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we do not engage with the IMF because this is a bailout. We</p>
<p>engage with the IMF for two specific reasons and they are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We want to use a credible international partner to endorse our reform package</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>Page 41:</p>
<p>(2) As we continue with our expans10nary policies for driving up our PNG</p>
<p>economy, we need to borrow funds and he is the point of difference between the Marape</p>
<p>Rosso Government and the previous governments. We focus all of our financing on cheap</p>
<p>good concessional loans.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have not and I hope we don't go down the track of engaging</p>
<p>with expensive commercial loans and to be able to access concessional loans, two things</p>
<p>happen; not only do you pay lower interest like we have done this year, and I mentioned</p>
<p>yesterday in my speech where we've reduced the cost of interest and this year we're making</p>
<p>a saving of Kl.3 billion. Why don't some ofus talk about some of the positive things that</p>
<p>his government is doing? Why do we continually talk down on our economy? Mr Acting</p>
<p>Speaker, Kl.3 billion savings this year and where does that go? Probably to most of the</p>
<p>DSIP and infrastructure development funds that Ialibu-Pangia will also benefit from.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - The honourable Minister, I remind you that your 20</p>
<p>minutes' debate time has lapsed but for the importance of this debate I'll give you another</p>
<p>two minutes to sum up your debate. However, I'd like to inform you that when you are</p>
<p>debating, you have to look at the Chair and debate, do not look at your colleague Members</p>
<p>and debate.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - Certainly, Mr Acting Speaker, your wish is my</p>
<p>command. So, to finish off with the IMF, the second reason why we use and why we need</p>
<p>to engage with the IMF is because all of the financing that we will require to continue</p>
<p>increasing our development budget until we reach that very important target date of 2027</p>
<p>to achieve a budget surplus and until we reach that very important date of 2034, where we</p>
<p>will give the government of the day the option for zero sovereign debt.</p>
<p>It is that all financing is contingent upon the IMF endorsing all of our programs</p>
<p>going forward. So, when we talk about getting assistance from the Australian and Japanese</p>
<p>Government, getting programs and assistance from the World Bank, the Asian</p>
<p>Development Bank and other multilateral partners. There is a condition which they place</p>
<p>and the IMF must endorse our 5-year fiscal framework.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, to conclude, we don't go down this parth, then we are forced to</p>
<p>go down the alternative that he took and that is, going for commercial loans not only would</p>
<p>you pay more but you will be able to find less and you will not be able to grow the budget</p>
<p>Page 42:</p>
<p>that Marape-Rosso Government has done in the three years that we've been in government.</p>
<p>If you study carefully the 13-year plan, I'll invite you for a free lunch at the Treasury and</p>
<p>explain to you in detail the benefits of our 13-year plane.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - I was about to interrupt you on your time but you</p>
<p>finish.</p>
<p>27/02</p>
<p>Mr JOSEPH LELANG (Kandrian-Glouchester - Opposition Leader) - Thank</p>
<p>you, Mr Acting Speaker. I was hoping that this important matter will be debated at a later</p>
<p>time, but I am also happy that it has been brought forward.</p>
<p>I want to add to this debate by discussing a few things that we have heard from the</p>
<p>Treasurer about the downturn on the global economy with World Bank revising the growth</p>
<p>downwards. Obviously, with the COVID-19 effects still being felt around the world, some</p>
<p>economies have recovered while some are still yet too.</p>
<p>As a nation, we are affected in so many ways. Now we are talking about a possible</p>
<p>IMF standby arrangement and a structural adjustment program also from the world bank.</p>
<p>I am thankful that during the Minister's presentation, the paper has attached schedule</p>
<p>outlining the quantitative and the qualitative performance criteria's, including the structural</p>
<p>benchmarks. My comments will be focused on that in this debate.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, from what has been presented, this is a loan that will be repaid</p>
<p>in about five and half years and the maturity is ten years, meaning that the responsibility</p>
<p>ofrepaying that loan will be left to the next government after the elections in 2027. I want</p>
<p>to outline some of the measures that will be imposed on us.</p>
<p>As I have said, this is like a carrot. If they give us the money, we will give them the</p>
<p>carrot. It comes with a lot of conditionality's, that have just been outlined. I want to also</p>
<p>add that there are a lot of risks associated with this particular program.</p>
<p>Firstly, the K3.25 billion loan will be disbursed over 38 months, a six-monthly</p>
<p>dispersal. It addresses the fiscal, monetary and the external sector of our economy. The</p>
<p>issue ofrisks arises when you look at the timing. We have a global economy that has been</p>
<p>revised downward. We are still in the COVID-19 pandemic situation.</p>
<p>I am hearing, seeing and reading from our domestic economy, that many of our</p>
<p>sectors are struggling. For business houses, the issues of inflationary pressures are still out</p>
<p>Page 43:</p>
<p>there. And so, when we look at the timing issue, is there a risk? The reason why I am saying</p>
<p>this, and one of the things that is not shown in the quantitative performance criteria, is the</p>
<p>growth.</p>
<p>Usually, under IMF standby arrangements and programs, they list everything,</p>
<p>including growth GDP. That is missing. I will rely on empirical evidences of other</p>
<p>countries, that do undergo structural adjustment programs from the IMF. And, usually it</p>
<p>starts with a contraction in the economy.</p>
<p>As you will note from the quantitative schedule as well, the size of the budget deficit</p>
<p>has been fixed. In fact, it has been reduced from this year's estimated budget deficit of</p>
<p>around 5. 9 per cent.</p>
<p>28/02</p>
<p>So, the size of the budget is going to be tightened up. Within that context obviously</p>
<p>in other parts of the globe and when we study these things and initially when you start a</p>
<p>project the size of the economy will contract. And I was just hoping that they would put</p>
<p>that kind of quantitative indicators there so that we can see how the economy will be</p>
<p>performing under an IMF program.</p>
<p>That is something that is missing and I am pretty sure the officials have discussed</p>
<p>that here and that is one of the risks. Another thing that is missing here is that you know</p>
<p>there are various portions of our population within our society that are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>When you have this kind of programs the government must build into a social intervention</p>
<p>program. Whilst we are implementing this we must also target and protect our budget that</p>
<p>flows towards assisting the portion of our population that are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>If the Treasurer is talking about the household assistance program build that inside</p>
<p>the measure. We must not build it outside as it might be cut off through deficit and this is</p>
<p>the reason why I am trying to add in my debate is that those two elements are missing. And</p>
<p>if we can have them on will be a good idea. The other issue is the one on exchange rates</p>
<p>and I just want to caution, while I know that the fund has been very adamant that we need</p>
<p>to remove our exchange rate and let the market clear the exchange rate value and obviously</p>
<p>we all know that it will go down.</p>
<p>My concern is that we have a huge debt in external loans and when we do that and</p>
<p>I mean the Treasurer, the government and its officials need to study this very well. Is he</p>
<p>going to lead us into default because we have almost US$6-7 billion in external debt alone?</p>
<p>I am raising this concern because by looking at the quantitative performance criteria of the</p>
<p>Page 44:</p>
<p>fund, you will notice that when the fund hits and by the end of this year the foreign reserves</p>
<p>level will drop from the current US$3.26 billion to US$ 1.76 billion. That is one of the</p>
<p>effects and it is part of the criteria. I am just thinking around it and that is risk.</p>
<p>If we use the ratio of a kina to US 0.28 cents that is going to be around K5-6 billion</p>
<p>in foreign reserves by the end of this year under the program and I am pretty sure that they</p>
<p>will try to show up our connections through all those loans. I just want to add that as a risk,</p>
<p>given that we are already affected. Many of the business houses are already affected by the</p>
<p>foreign exchange issues that we are having.</p>
<p>These are the risks that I want to highlight and some of the missing links that we</p>
<p>need to look at. The last thing I want to say is that, I came across a gentleman which most</p>
<p>of you may know; he was a former professor at UPNG back in the 60s. Professor Clunnis</p>
<p>Ross; I think he was there with Professor Ross Gamer during those times. I met him during</p>
<p>my studies during one of the IMF and World Bank negotiations and we were doing this</p>
<p>mock negotiation and so he introduced himself and I had a chat with him and this is what</p>
<p>he said, 'PNG you shouldn't be running to the IMF and the World Bank'.</p>
<p>29/02</p>
<p>There are only two countries in the world that is PNG and Botswana. You have so</p>
<p>much minerals, gas, diamonds and resources and you are able to stabilize your economy</p>
<p>with the Minerals Stabilization Fund in those days. And so he said this is a good thing, you</p>
<p>can sort out your issues and show to the other countries that you can do it. So I thought that</p>
<p>I can leave that as a parting message on my debate.</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr DON POL YE (Kandep - Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science</p>
<p>and Technology and Sports) - Mr Acting Speaker I would like to join in the debate, I'm</p>
<p>not one very keen to gag on other leaders talking, I will have to listen to them. But always</p>
<p>have this view that under three conditions we should stop any mislead is the varsity of facts</p>
<p>presented to the Parliament and to the people when the facts are not correct and</p>
<p>misconstrued. I think it's a duty of all of us to say if the facts are not true; to establish the</p>
<p>facts in black and white like the honourable Treasurer has done. So, the misinformation</p>
<p>must be corrected and I think the Treasurer has adequately done that.</p>
<p>If the Opposition, or any member on the Floor of Parliament and anybody who</p>
<p>would like to rebut what the Government is doing. There must be an alternative policy, or</p>
<p>Page 45:</p>
<p>in this case, if one was in Government before and for instance, we have two former Prime</p>
<p>Ministers here. The Rt Honourable Sir Julius Chan, the former Prime Minister, one of the</p>
<p>best we had and the Honourable member for Ialibu-Pangia, Mr Peter O'Neill. For such</p>
<p>people of that category to speak, they must also tell what they did and what the present</p>
<p>Government is doing against what they did. Therefore, what they did, did bring such</p>
<p>positive results and return on investments they did and they can compare that with the</p>
<p>current Government.</p>
<p>In those circumstances the former Prime Minister fell very short to explain and</p>
<p>justify his points and therefore if one was listening to the argument presented, you would</p>
<p>be inclined with the 100 per cent surety to believe what the Treasurer had presented in</p>
<p>support of what the Prime Minister had said rather than to listen to the opposing argument.</p>
<p>The third category of argument should be the one who comes before to discuss the</p>
<p>issue must come with clean hands and in law, it is the maximum principle of equity, I have</p>
<p>clean hands. But I think in this case I find it very difficult to forget very fresh memories</p>
<p>recently. What they had done; they had hurt this country so much and then speak as if they</p>
<p>have clean hands</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr Acting Speaker, I had to intervene and raise a point of order because</p>
<p>I have vivid memories of the very issue that was raised. Let me mention just one or two</p>
<p>before I support the Treasurer in his statement yesterday. On the statement presented, I</p>
<p>would like to advise and guide all the members of Parliament that the facts here are perfect.</p>
<p>In other words, the figures and status here are very true. You can search it, you can google</p>
<p>it, you can ask the World Bank, IMF and other Sovereign nations of the facts about Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea; you will find that it is true. For instance, PNG's GDP growth is 3.5 per cent.</p>
<p>The world will shrink down 1.7 per cent from the 3 .5 per cent growth. That is a fact. I will</p>
<p>support.</p>
<p>When we talk about employment, that was the advice that was given to some of us</p>
<p>when we were the Prime Minister at that time; that is when we get the money we put</p>
<p>elsewhere and not create employment. Buying shares in other countries could not provide</p>
<p>employment. That would destroy employment.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, you look at Hansard in the Parliament, I was on the other side</p>
<p>as leader of the Oppositions and I usually give that advise too.</p>
<p>30/02</p>
<p>Page 46:</p>
<p>Ifwe get such money, K3.l billion which is almost 90 per cent of the development</p>
<p>Budget of Papua New Guinea at that time. In other words, you are getting the Development</p>
<p>Budget of Papua New Guinea and putting it into a speculative market. If you did that, then</p>
<p>you will be able to see in the next 10 to 20 years, unemployment, inflation, foreign reserves</p>
<p>with challenges, cash flow situations. We will see all of this because Papua New Guinea</p>
<p>is a growing economy, we need to strengthen it to a mature economy and people will never</p>
<p>listened and now I hear the same people crying over spilt milk. They are saying, there's 10</p>
<p>000 people who are looking for jobs, and there are none created? You were in that position;</p>
<p>you had a decision making power to do that.</p>
<p>The other thing that we raised was, do not give jobs to foreigners. We give our</p>
<p>people jobs in the construction industry. That was the call that was made genuinely and</p>
<p>sincerely. Not just by a leader of the opposition or somebody who opposed policies of the</p>
<p>former Prime Minister of his Government. But we said, don't give jobs to overseas people.</p>
<p>Now what has happened? Now overseas people are coming in. They have their own</p>
<p>companies with their own interests and they kill our local interest.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we must speak strategically and see what we have done; learn</p>
<p>from the past and correct the future. Some of us we just talk without thinking about what</p>
<p>we have done. Another thing is the debt level. Our debt levels were really high, and I</p>
<p>always reminded him that our debt levels must never go up because we will destroy our</p>
<p>economy</p>
<p>I would like to hear a new member of parliament talk about this issue not the same</p>
<p>members of parliament who has been here in Parliament for many years.</p>
<p>Now the Marape/Rosso government has come in and is trying its best to clean up</p>
<p>an issue that was created by people who never listened in the past. And now those who</p>
<p>want to complain must have clean hands. I know that these a fair comment that I'm making</p>
<p>so we understand for the future and we must speak the truth and the truth will set us free.</p>
<p>On the issue of quantitative and qualitative performance criteria that I heard the</p>
<p>good leader of the Opposition mentioned that we will implement such programs and</p>
<p>therefore see this growth. You look at the performance of the Government, we already</p>
<p>have a growth of 3.5 per cent as per hour and we are going on the right track. The IMF did</p>
<p>not come and tell us how to grow it, we are already growing. But if there is an argument</p>
<p>that we are not seeing it, then the responsibility lies on your MP's, the public service and</p>
<p>those that have the responsibility mandated to amend the programs of Government. The</p>
<p>implementing issue is not the same as the policy issue. The Marape/Rosso government is</p>
<p>Page 47:</p>
<p>giving the right policy perspective, statistics are correct and the leadership is in the right</p>
<p>direction. Now the challenge has come to what the Treasurer was saying yesterday. He</p>
<p>said that the Budget must be effectively implemented so this lies solely on the members of</p>
<p>parliament, district administration, the provincial administration, the Governors, the</p>
<p>District Secretaries and so forth. It's now up to this House as to how implement the</p>
<p>programs to the public service.</p>
<p>Let me specifically talk about the areas I'm entrusted to look after in the area of</p>
<p>Education. I am happy that the Budget provides Kl .65 billion for the Education sector. It's</p>
<p>good that we spend money in that area. Not to invest in some stock exchange or business.</p>
<p>31/02</p>
<p>It is good to put Kl .65 billion. That is, about 51 per cent increase to skilling our</p>
<p>Papua New Guineans and that's a very good thing. If you look at what the Prime Minister</p>
<p>has said. In the next five years, we would like to see 30,000 non-school leavers have spaces</p>
<p>in all the universities and technical institutions and that is where the money is. As a</p>
<p>responsible minister, what I'm doing is, I am looking at ways to improve the skills of</p>
<p>Papua New Guineans with employment, but the employability of Papua New Guineans is</p>
<p>very important. If they have no skills, it is very difficult for them to get a job. Even though</p>
<p>we have the population, we will still cry. We want employment but if we don't train our</p>
<p>Papua New Guineans to be employed in the gas industry; the mining sector; the agriculture</p>
<p>sector; the construction industry and in all the other areas, then you'll find that employment</p>
<p>will be a problem because we have not produced skilled people.</p>
<p>What are you doing with this policy? Are we creating and developing skills that</p>
<p>are most relevant for Papua New Guineans so that they could have an employment?</p>
<p>The infrastructure development that the Treasurer mentioned is a key area. If you</p>
<p>look at all our institutions, universities and colleges, we are doing infrastructure</p>
<p>rehabilitation for science labs, classrooms and dormitories. We have K200 million in</p>
<p>partnership with ADB to implement the program and I am happily implementing it because</p>
<p>we would like to see the quality of our institutions when quality graduates come out from</p>
<p>these institutions. So, we are implementing the government's policy. If we had the Kl .56</p>
<p>billion in that sector, we should have implemented it already.</p>
<p>Now, in support of what the Treasurer said yesterday on effective implementation</p>
<p>of the budget, it is the public service. All of us have a duty to our districts, the DSIP we</p>
<p>Page 48:</p>
<p>get is a lot of money. It is Kl O million as for the budget but it will be K20 million for this</p>
<p>year and in the coming years.</p>
<p>When we talk about employment or any economic growth, it actually lies with the</p>
<p>individual MPs, the district administrators, finance managers and everybody on the</p>
<p>ground. Like in Kandep District, I hold meetings with them to discuss how to convert that</p>
<p>money into employability and economic growth and then link it to the Enga Provincial</p>
<p>Development Plan Vision 2050 and Medium-Term Development strategies of the National</p>
<p>Government. So we already have the solutions to the job we are doing.</p>
<p>We have the strategies and means of ways to solve those issues and yet you are</p>
<p>complaining. We should not be complaining, we should be happy and be cheerful. You</p>
<p>have a government that is putting a lot of money but it's up to individual MPs and their</p>
<p>public service administration to implement to achieve the intended returns.</p>
<p>I was complaining on the other side when the Member for Ialibu-Pangia was the</p>
<p>Prime Minister. I have your debt level has gone up to K35 billion. I heard the Prime</p>
<p>Minister James Marape said K29 billion because on the balance sheet of Treasury it was</p>
<p>K29 billion but if you look at the money that was used through the SOE s, it goes up to</p>
<p>K35 billion. You will find some of these SOE's don't have the money to invest to make</p>
<p>more money for themselves.</p>
<p>Like the PNG Power and other SOEs, money must be there as a capital? But when</p>
<p>you get a loan and start to build up debts like I alluded to earlier, actually the money that</p>
<p>were there in the SOE s under the leadership of former Prime Minister to my knowledge is</p>
<p>K35 billion. On the Treasury balance sheet is K29 billion so it is a challenge for this side</p>
<p>of the House to see how we can manage it. We can scale it down but at the same time, we</p>
<p>grow the economy, create employment for our people and implement programs as well as</p>
<p>looking at the rural sector through the DSIP funds.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the public service is a very important area. I think that the</p>
<p>implementation part is an issue and a challenge there.</p>
<p>On the leadership side, I think we are doing well as a government, but the only</p>
<p>challenges we have are in individual public service in every sector. The public service</p>
<p>needs to wake up to the reality. The leadership in the public service needs to be addressed</p>
<p>and according to the Treasurer we have heard the statement, that is being addressed</p>
<p>adequately through the partnership that the State has with IMF. We are addressing by way</p>
<p>of upgrading the skill, capacity and the capability of public service to implement these</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p>Page 49:</p>
<p>32/02</p>
<p>So we should stay focused on implementation and fixing the problems and</p>
<p>challenges in the areas that we are entrusted.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I believed that what a government can do under certain</p>
<p>circumstances has been done adequately. When you look at it, there are many alternatives</p>
<p>to take but with the current situation and circumstances that are presented, created in the</p>
<p>past and some challenges like Covid-19 and the inflation present, the Marape-Rosso</p>
<p>Government is implementing programs that are right. I think we should change our</p>
<p>mindset both the Government and the Opposition to look at what we must do to make areas</p>
<p>we are lacking better than always barking at the government.</p>
<p>The Government at the moment under all circumstances is doing well and should</p>
<p>be supported. I ask the Opposition to support the government by doing what they can do</p>
<p>rather than giving misconstrued facts or forgetting the past. I think the direction we should</p>
<p>take, is to learn from the past and build on from the present into the future. We must look</p>
<p>into the future as a nation of competency and affluence and that is where we are going.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, in conclusion as far as the Marape-Rosso Government is</p>
<p>concerned, we are doing well. We support the Treasurer and his economic management</p>
<p>regardless of the challenges, dynamics, and conditions we see today learn from the past</p>
<p>and let's move forward. I encourage us to discuss and debate very fruitfully like this but</p>
<p>with facts and if you are clean and you give suggestions, I think it is worth listening to, but</p>
<p>if you have contributed to the problems it's all right too, you can learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>This Government is moving in the right direction and the country needs to support it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Motion (by Mr Rainbo Paita) agreed to -</p>
<p>That the debate be adjourned to a subsequent siting to allow the other Members to</p>
<p>contribute.</p>
