<p>(1) Can the Minister provide me an inspector immediately?</p>
<p>] do not need money or planes, I need an inspector to inspect the airstrips and certify that</p>
<p>it can be operational. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT -— Thank you, Honourable Governor for his question.</p>
<p>He is one of the proactive and determined Governors to bring development into Morobe</p>
<p>Province. I recognize you, your enthusiasm and your knowledge to bring in these kinds of</p>
<p>development.</p>
<p>Honourable Governor, in response to your question, I have already replied to some parts</p>
<p>of your question in the first part of my series of answers to the Honourable Member. I can</p>
<p>provide more guidance if you require of me.</p>
<p>You said you do not need funding but technical support. I will encourage you to go and</p>
<p>consult Rural Airstrip Association (RAA). I am happy to provide their contact details for you</p>
<p>after this session and am also willing to bring you to their office.</p>
<p>Honourable Governor, all you will need is an understanding and an agreement signed</p>
<p>with RAA. They will then facilitate through you, a schedule for engineers to come down to</p>
<p>your respective airstrips, according to your selection and nomination.</p>

<p>I am happy to provide approval and facilitate for them to assist your rural airstrips in</p>
<p>Morobe Province to be up and running. Thank you.</p>
<p>Establishment and Operations of ICAC</p>
<p>Mr JOHN KAUPA - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for the interest of this nation,</p>
<p>my questions are directed to the Honourable Prime Minister. We are currently in the 11th</p>
<p>Parliament session and yet people are still talking about corruption. Corruption is at all levels</p>
<p>in our society.</p>
<p>08/05</p>
<p>What is the meaning of corruption? Corruption is dishonesty, fraudulent dealing and</p>
<p>typical involvement in bribery. There are many more definitions for corruption in this country</p>
<p>at all levels. With the former Prime Minister, they said he was corrupt and with the current</p>
<p>Prime Minister in this 11th Parliament, they say the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is corruption in all levels in our society, from the institutions,</p>
<p>government departments, and corporate bodies and even in our houses.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the Prime Minister for the good of the nation and for everyone to</p>
<p>know what this government is doing.</p>
<p>(1) With so much question of corruption in our country, what is the government doing</p>
<p>on the Independent Commission Against Corruption and when is ICAC going to be</p>
<p>established?</p>
<p>(2) Can the Prime Minister explain to the nation, whether the role and power of</p>
<p>Ombudsman Commission will be diluted once ICAC is in function?</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker. I am pleased to see you</p>
<p>sitting on that seat. I want to respond to the question from the Honourable Member for Port</p>
<p>Moresby North-East through you. He asked about the establishment and operations of the</p>
<p>Independent Commission Against Corruption. His second question was about the role and</p>
<p>power of the Ombudsman Commission, whether it will be diluted or maintained? I think these</p>
<p>are two very important questions for the benefit of our people.</p>
<p>As the Government, we stand to fight the issues of corruption in this country. Corruption</p>
<p>in its simplest definition is the act of us breaching the country’s law, whether the law is to do</p>
<p>with money or the appointment process, or any existing law in the country. I want to assure</p>
<p>Page 12:</p>
<p>this Parliament and the country that since we took the office in 2019, that was one of our</p>
<p>resolution. In fact, in my maiden address to the Parliament on 30" May 2019, not only myself,</p>
<p>but all the leaders who were with me during that time talked about ensuring that the</p>
<p>Independent Commission Against Corruption Act be passed and the Whistle-blowers Act be</p>
<p>passed, and making sure that the institution is established to combat corruption.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I would like to report to you and to the country through Parliament</p>
<p>that the Independent Commission Against Corruption has been established by this Parliament.</p>
<p>I want to also appreciate all Members of the Parliament on both sides. The vision for</p>
<p>setting up ICAC is not a new idea, it was there since the third or the second Parliament. In the</p>
<p>1980s the late Sir Anthony Siaguru amongst others talked about setting up this institution to</p>
<p>fight corruption. But since the 80s up till 2019, there were no major moves made to establish</p>
<p>such an organization. I would like to also recognize the previous O’Neill Government, they</p>
<p>started some work but the matter did not reach the Parliament, it stopped short. Despite giving</p>
<p>notices, the version that they carried out in 2014 and 2015 fell short of reaching the Parliament</p>
<p>and for Parliament to setup the laws.</p>
<p>09/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to inform the country that the Organic Law on the</p>
<p>Independent Commission Against Corruption has been passed by this Parliament in the 10"</p>
<p>Parliament and today we are working on this law to be operationalised.</p>
<p>I also want to report further that on the fight against corruption which we brought ICAC</p>
<p>Law to be passed and also a sister law for a smooth flow of work has also been passed, which</p>
<p>is the Whistle Blowers Act. This law will protect whoever reports the corruption in the country</p>
<p>and their immediate boss must not terminate them from work or punish them if they happen to</p>
<p>report corrupt practices.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I also want to inform the country that all Members of Parliament</p>
<p>on both sides were not scared to pass this law which we amended on Proceeds of Crime Act in</p>
<p>the last Parliament. That law was amended and there was an incision made for the undisclosed</p>
<p>wealth provision to be included in the main law of the Proceeds of Crime Act to be recognised;</p>
<p>whether you are a member of Parliament, minister of State, prime minister or public servant,</p>
<p>we all live within the space of our income.</p>
<p>For instances, if you have ten cars that don’t match your salary than ICAC, IRC or even</p>
<p>police have all the right to come and investigate and must know the sources of having all these</p>
<p>assets. These laws have been passed by the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>Page 13:</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I also want to inform this Parliament and the country that, don’t</p>
<p>think that all Members of Parliament on both sides are not sensitive to the issue of corruption</p>
<p>in the country. If the leaders at this point in time were not sensitive on the issue of corruption,</p>
<p>then the Government of Marape-Basil and later Marape-Rosso won’t get that support to pass</p>
<p>all these critical laws to stabilise the work to protect our country against this sickness of</p>
<p>corruption. And so, leaders from last and this term are continuing in this work for it to bear</p>
<p>fruit.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I also want to inform Parliament and the country that the process</p>
<p>of selecting the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners has been completed. We</p>
<p>followed the concerns raised by the leaders and many commentators in our country that we</p>
<p>must not select Papua New Guineans to take lead in this area of Independent Commission</p>
<p>Against Corruption.</p>
<p>But an independent process has been taken to select the Commissioner and the two</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioners. Which the Executive Government under my leadership doesn’t have</p>
<p>any input in this process. We appointed Transparency International to supervise this process so</p>
<p>that the work of ICAC must start at a clean path right from day one. And so, Transparency</p>
<p>International under the Chairmanship of Mr Peter Aitsi, supervises the process in appointing</p>
<p>the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners.</p>
<p>The only input that I recommended was with respect to the other Papua new Guineans</p>
<p>that applied who must be given a fair go, but where possible, if foreigners go through the</p>
<p>selection process and ranked first, then select them because they won’t have any inter-</p>
<p>connections within the country to run this very important office to fight corruption. So that</p>
<p>from day one, they can commence their work as far as fighting corruption is concern.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to inform Parliament that two Australians and a New</p>
<p>Zealander, all are very experienced persons; I think a former police prosecutors and a judge</p>
<p>were appointed. I can’t recall exactly their background but very competent applicants.</p>
<p>10/05</p>
<p>They have come through the due process that Transparency International has supervised.</p>
<p>And the final appointment recommendations were made by the committee which includes the</p>
<p>Chief Justice, the Opposition Leader and the Prime Minister. So, there was a qualified</p>
<p>committee to appoint the ICAC Commissioners.</p>
<p>And we’ve already appointed the Commissioner and the two Assistant Commissioners;</p>
<p>their letters of offer were sent to them and they all have accepted it. We are in the process to</p>
<p>Page 14:</p>
<p>ensure that the ICAC will be fully operational with funding set aside we are fully committed</p>
<p>to the ICAC operations.</p>
<p>On the issue regarding Ombudsman Commission, I want to make it clear that the ICAC</p>
<p>will not assume the role of Ombudsman Commission. The Ombudsman Commission’s role is</p>
<p>to look after people who are under the leadership code.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to say that as we setup ICAC and it becomes fully</p>
<p>functional, we will also look holistically into reviewing and clarifying the role of Ombudsman</p>
<p>Commission so that it can work publicly, especially for people who report to Ombudsman in</p>
<p>response to the leadership roles.</p>
<p>There’s an issue of double jeopardy. So, we will look into fixing that and leaders can</p>
<p>have a clear path without bringing them into double jeopardy situation, where they exposed to</p>
<p>two or three different offices that are running prosecution. So, there will be one clear part where</p>
<p>leaders go through to respond to any issues pertaining to corruption that may arise in the future.</p>
<p>So, Ombudsman’s role will not be diluted but clarified, augmented and amended for</p>
<p>those areas where sometimes both organizations are handling the same task, and instead of</p>
<p>progressing a matter they become stalled and held back. So, I want to inform the country that</p>
<p>we have setup the ICAC and it’s running. We’ve amended the relevant laws to assist ICAC’s</p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>As soon as the Commissioner’s take office, the organization will be functioning and</p>
<p>moving forward. I hope before 16 September this year, the institution will be fully established.</p>
<p>Let me encourage our society out there that not all leaders in here are corrupt, do not accuse</p>
<p>them on Facebook.</p>
<p>If you have evidence file it before ICAC, Ombudsman and police. Put your evidence</p>
<p>through Police, Ombudsman and later to ICAC. Facebook is not a police station nor is it the</p>
<p>Ombudsman’s Commission Office or ICAC. These body of leaders here in the tenth Parliament</p>
<p>and this Parliament are conscious to the duty of the nation and both sides have responded, we</p>
<p>passed ICAC already.</p>
<p>This Government stands ready to fund ICAC to go into operation and it is all our</p>
<p>collective responsibility to report on corruption and the due process will be setup. And if</p>
<p>someone is found to have acted improperly and engaged in corruption, the laws that we are</p>
<p>setting up will catchup with him or her and hopefully they receive the penalties.</p>
<p>So, I am assuring the country that ICAC is being setup by these generations of leaders,</p>
<p>and it’s not James Marape only but all the leaders supporting it. We have established ICAC</p>
<p>and we are ready for its operation this year. The commissioners have been appointed through</p>
<p>Page 15:</p>
<p>the independent oversight of Transparency International and we are ready to support this</p>
<p>organization to prosecute and arrest corruption in our country.</p>
<p>Thank you, very much.</p>
