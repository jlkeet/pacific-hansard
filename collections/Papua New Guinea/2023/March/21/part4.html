<p>Housing - Review Eviction Process</p>
<p>Sir PUKA TEMU ~— Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker. My questions goes to the</p>
<p>Honourable Minister for Housing, if he is present in the House.</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker, this morning as I was driving to Parliament, I bought</p>
<p>one of the dailies, the Post-Courier. And on page five of the Post-Courier I saw a family with</p>
<p>little children and their luggage outside the home they have been living in for 46 years. The</p>
<p>reason reported in today’s Post-Courier was that the new tenants went out to seek a Court</p>
<p>Order to give another citizen who has been living there for 46 years a 24-hour notice with</p>
<p>police support to evict this family and nowhere to go, and I believe they are still there.</p>
<p>Assistant Speaker, the reason why I am asking this question is because I have personally</p>
<p>experienced this with two of my Abau citizens who have gone through the same process.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have three questions to ask the honourable Minister for Housing.</p>
<p>(1) Can the honourable Minister for Housing review the process of eviction of our</p>
<p>citizens in such situations? This family was living in this property for 46 years. He claims that</p>
<p>he has no outstanding rental arrears and that he received the 24-hour notice from the Court and</p>
<p>so he was moved illegally and another citizen moved in.</p>
<p>I believe the Housing Minister will have to bring some humanity into the eviction</p>
<p>processes in this regard. And I strongly recommend to the Honourable House this process be</p>
<p>never repeated to another citizen in this country. I ask the Minister to review the eviction</p>
<p>processes and if it would have been proper for example, if the NHC would have informed the</p>
<p>residing tenant that we have a new tenant and we are informing you that the house has changed</p>
<p>Page 16:</p>
<p>hands. Wouldn’t it have been proper to do that rather than the new tenant goes to Court, brings</p>
<p>the police and the 24-hour notice to evict another citizen of the country. I understand Mr</p>
<p>Assistant Speaker, that they are still outside the House waiting for what to do.</p>
<p>This tenant went to Court because he doesn’t have a title, the Court never listened to him.</p>
<p>I personally feel Mr Assistant Speaker, that this is not fair, that is why I am asking the question.</p>
<p>(2) Given my experience from my citizens from Abau who went through the same</p>
<p>process, can the Minister undertake an investigation on whether this new tenant went through</p>
<p>the proper legal process.</p>
<p>12/05</p>
<p>Can the Minister guarantee and make a commitment that the investigation take place?</p>
<p>From experience, this has been going on for too long. Ordinary citizens who have been living</p>
<p>there have been unnecessarily removed because someone with money goes and bulldozes</p>
<p>simple living laws. One of my experiences was that one ordinary citizen was removed and the</p>
<p>Minister for Housing moved into that property. Those are the experiences. I am not saying that</p>
<p>the current Minister for Housing has done that, but I am expressing an experience and we must</p>
<p>all avoid these circumstances. We cannot use our privileged power to suppress another citizen</p>
<p>who has no power at all. So, again, can the Minister make an undertaking to investigate whether</p>
<p>this new tenant gained the title through proper legal means?</p>
<p>(3) Can the Minister also intervene to address this issue and give some certainty to that</p>
<p>tenant that has been living there for 46 years?</p>
<p>It will require going to the court to put a stay order and allow the process by undertaking</p>
<p>an investigation and get the families to go back to the residential home. These are the types of</p>
<p>things that give assurance that the Government works. That our people need comfort and can</p>
<p>trust the government of the day, and we are the government of the day. And so Minister, please,</p>
<p>if you can do that, I am sure the family that has been shut out by a Court of law will have some</p>
<p>relief, and hopefully, a more humane process can be can be undertaken and give relief to both</p>
<p>parties and everyone is on a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Mr KOBBY BOMAREO - Mr Assistant Speaker, I thank the Member for Abau for his</p>
<p>very important questions today. It is an honour today for me too as a new Minister to receive</p>
<p>my first question from a very senior Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>I also take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the Marape/Rosso Government for</p>
<p>the appointment to this ministry. I also take this time to thank the Prime Minister where my</p>
<p>Page 17:</p>
<p>people and electorate gathered and forged their undivided support to contribute to pay the</p>
<p>Prime Minister’s nomination fee to win the elections and become the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Let me go back to the questions. Yes, it is public knowledge that the Housing Ministry</p>
<p>or department is riddled with a lot of problems. Most of these problems have accumulated over</p>
<p>many years, and I have inherited all these problems and it is not easy to correct these issues.</p>
<p>As soon as I was appointed, I had my first meeting with the administration and instructed</p>
<p>them to table all records relating to the status of NHC Houses throughout the country. Some of</p>
<p>the people currently occupying those houses are fourth and fifth generation families.</p>
<p>Many properties are now before the Courts and others have been put up for sale</p>
<p>erroneously.</p>
<p>My department is in the process of establishing this report so that we can all appreciate</p>
<p>fully and understand the nature of this circumstances. Solving of these problems cannot happen</p>
<p>overnight and it will take time and patience as we go along.</p>
<p>But I agree with the senior member, Member for Abau, that it is the duty of this</p>
<p>Government to protect and serve its people and also provide affordable accommodation. It is</p>
<p>the duty of the department to protect those tenants who have been residents of NHC properties.</p>
<p>13/05</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was also an eviction up in Jiwaka and I received a text message so |</p>
<p>called up the police there and advised them to stop the eviction.</p>
<p>So, Member, before you asked your question, I have already instructed my lawyers to</p>
<p>stop the eviction and then later J will go myself and see them.</p>
<p>To answer your question on the review of the process of eviction, the National Housing</p>
<p>Commission has a process on who to evict identify if a tenant is not complying after being</p>
<p>issued several notices and whether they are in breach of the notice. In this instant, I will have</p>
<p>to find out and report back to you and this House. I believe that I gave an instruction in my</p>
<p>maiden speech to stop evictions until we know the situations of the property.</p>
<p>You also asked about investigation, this is part of the Eviction Process of the National</p>
<p>Housing Commission, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>On the question of how to assist the families, I think I am assisting by advising aganst</p>
<p>any eviction to stop and I will look into this matter to resolve it.</p>
<p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to use this opportunity to say that the Marape-Rosso</p>
<p>Government, has been looking into how well it can support and cater for citizens at all classes</p>
<p>from the cleaner to the manager to provide affordable accommodation.</p>
<p>Page 18:</p>
<p>I believe that this Government has supported my ministry and soon I will present a</p>
<p>statement on how best we can accommodate the employed and unemployed who can be able</p>
<p>to pay rentals because at the end of the day we want to see that everyone owns a house. We</p>
<p>move around during the day but at night everyone goes back to their homes and it is also a right</p>
<p>under the Human Rights to have a house, water and food.</p>
<p>So the Government has not forgotten they will still go ahead and ensure that our citizens</p>
<p>have reasonable and affordable houses.</p>
<p>I thank the Member for Abau for his questions and I will get back to him in detail as soon</p>
<p>as I find answers on the incidents that occurred and the one in Jiwaka.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, there are some National Housing Commission officers who don’t</p>
<p>comply with Department’s procedures and processes. I would also want to tell this House that</p>
<p>in January, I removed five general managers for insubordination of instructions from the</p>
<p>ministry office. We must adhere to the laws.</p>
<p>The National Housing Commission is corrupted, the ministers and managing directors of</p>
<p>the past have corrupted the department so now we are trying to transform it. The officers of the</p>
<p>Department know that under my leadership, that if you do not comply with the laws I will get</p>
<p>rid of you. In the department I have mixed representation from all the regions of PNG not just</p>
<p>one region of employees dominating the department.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>Air Niugini — Spike in Airfares</p>
<p>Mr JAMES DONALD - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for recognising the people</p>
<p>of North-Fly. It doesn’t mean that the Assistant Speaker is from Western province and he has</p>
<p>giving me the opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>My question is directed to the Minister for State Enterprise regarding some issues that</p>
<p>we are facing daily with Air Niugini.</p>
<p>There is a five per cent fee that Air Niugini charges for cash payments on airfares but if</p>
<p>paying through EFTPOS you won’t be charged extra. I want to know why they are doing this</p>
<p>because not everyone has a bank card.</p>
<p>14/05</p>
<p>Think of those simple village people who carry cash in their hands. So, how could we be</p>
<p>genuine in our service to the general public in that sense?</p>
<p>However, my two questions to the Minister are as follows:</p>
<p>Page 19:</p>
<p>(1) Can there be some undertaking by the Minister assuring that this style of practice</p>
<p>would not happen again?</p>
<p>I am struggling to pay for the airfares. The ticket fare for Air Niugini from Port Moresby</p>
<p>to Kiunga is K1, 800 for one way. It has increased by 40 to 50 per cent over the last one year.</p>
<p>Normally, the airfares that we used to pay is around K700 to K800, and I am wondering what</p>
<p>is really happening. I have tried to compare Air Niugini with other airline companies, for</p>
<p>instance PNG Air charged around K800 to K900 and that is reasonable but for Air Niugini, it</p>
<p>has gone that high so why is that? Is there anything wrong?</p>
<p>(2) Can an assessments be done and report to the House and tell us why Air Niugini has</p>
<p>increased the airfares? Not only Kiunga sector but all sectors across the country. Please, I an</p>
<p>undertaking to resolve this because if Air Niugini is our pride, where is their fairness to the</p>
<p>citizens of this country?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. I would like to thank the</p>
<p>Member for North Fly for these very important questions.</p>
<p>Firstly, in relation to the cash handling fee, if our society were a law abiding society</p>
<p>and our people respected the rule of law, it would be easy for all of us.</p>
<p>Air Niugini is forced to transfer, whatever it costs and whatever it takes, the</p>
<p>passengers’ cash payments. It is forced to engage security companies to move that cash. There</p>
<p>is a cost of operating in a country like ours where the chances of Air Niugini sales office, just</p>
<p>like any other businesses, being robbed is very high. So, unfortunately, these are costs that all</p>
<p>of us need to pay and that reflects a society that we live in now.</p>
<p>So there is an extra cost that Air Niugini charges by collecting cash handling fees from</p>
<p>our travelling public so people are now being encouraged not to carry cash but to try and use</p>
<p>bank cards.</p>
<p>That also means getting things like our NID and everything else sorted out in this</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have to bear the cost of doing business in this country. It is happening</p>
<p>everywhere and Air Niugini is not the only one. Even the banks and others are charging cash</p>
<p>handling fees.</p>
<p>In relation to the increase of airfares that are being charged by Air Niugini, yes, I agree.</p>
<p>There's a problem there and I must admit before the Parliament that those inclusions were never</p>
<p>approved by the Board of Air Niugini, never came before me as the Minister responsible and</p>
<p>Page 20:</p>
<p>for that reason together with other reasons, those people who were behind these acts were</p>
<p>terminated. It is not for me to tell this Parliament or the public all the reasons why people have</p>
<p>to go as they also have rights to defend themselves. So these are the least I can tell you. This is</p>
<p>the only reason why Cabinet has to make a decision to let go of the CEO and we are looking at</p>
<p>that aspect.</p>
<p>The Air Niugini’s intention is to provide fares that are affordable for our people. It is</p>
<p>not a company that is led by people who are blind. So, I must tell the Parliament that this is one</p>
<p>of the reason why change has to be made to the senior executives of Air Niugini. There were</p>
<p>two gentlemen who had to be asked to leave. So Air Niugini Board is now being asked to</p>
<p>review the level of rates that are being imposed on our traveling public and we expect to be</p>
<p>able to introduce a rate that is affordable for people.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>15/05</p>
<p>Highlands Highway Rehabilitation Program</p>
<p>Mr WILLIAM HAGAHUNO - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. My questions are</p>
<p>directed to the Minister for Works and Highways.</p>
<p>Actually, this is a lead up from an earlier question that I posed to the minister early this</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>The question I asked was about the delay in completion of the rehabilitation of the</p>
<p>Highlands Highway, the ADB funded project and the quality of the workmanship that was</p>
<p>carried out. In the course of his answers, he informed the House, that the ADB, the financier</p>
<p>selects the contractor and they also do the project management. That leads me to conclude that</p>
<p>our Works Department is a spectator or a bystander in the whole process.</p>
<p>Now my questions stem from there. The concerns are that the roads are the property of</p>
<p>the sovereign nation of Papua New Guinea and the state through the Department of Works</p>
<p>performs our oversight functions or project managing and making sure there is quality and</p>
<p>standard in the way the contractors carry out the work.</p>
<p>My concern and is also concern in this House, given the fact that the Government is</p>
<p>spending a large chunk of the national budget on road works — is whether the work that is being</p>
<p>carried out by the contractors is worth the money that we are spending. I have personal</p>
<p>knowledge of the fact that the sealing of the Highlands Highway was carried out by a company</p>
<p>called Dillingham Corporation. It started in the late 70s and was completed around the early</p>
<p>Page 21:</p>
<p>80s. For the next 40 years the workmanship that was put there withstood the test of times and</p>
<p>now we are getting in new contractors to now do the rehabilitation.</p>
<p>But seeing the way the work has been carried out, every week they seal part of the road.</p>
<p>They have to take them out again and seal them. That is the kind of workmanship we are getting</p>
<p>under the current arrangements.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>(1) Is it by design that the conditions of the loan arrangement state that we should leave</p>
<p>the selection of contractors as well as the project supervision and management of those</p>
<p>contracts to ADB, or is it by default on our part that we have been ignorant of the important</p>
<p>fact of project management ensuring quality of the work that is done? So, we have ended up in</p>
<p>this situation where works managers and engineers are pushed to the side and are bystanders</p>
<p>now in the whole arrangement.</p>
<p>So that’s the first question whether it’s a condition of the loan, it’s a design or whether</p>
<p>it is by default or by our own ignorance and the loan negotiating team.</p>
<p>(2) If it is a condition of the loan, can the state negotiating team in future on projects</p>
<p>such as this negotiate properly so that the state, who is the owner of the project that is for the</p>
<p>benefit of our people, properly supervise, manage and oversee there is quality in the way work</p>
<p>is delivered so that it lasts like what Dillingham Corporation did way back which lasted for 30-</p>
<p>40 years without maintenance.</p>
<p>(3) Considering that it is costing our nation, our country and the people more than</p>
<p>K3billion, the people have to dig deeper into their pockets to repay this loan, can your</p>
<p>department carry out an audit of the whole Highway Rehabilitation Project as soon as it is</p>
<p>completed?</p>
<p>This is so that this nation and the people are informed that we have got value for money</p>
<p>for the kind of work the contractor has produced, and so that we have a guarantee that it’s going</p>
<p>to last the next 30 or 40 years, even if we do not come up with enough money to continue to</p>
<p>maintain it. I do not want to see another road rehabilitation project as soon as a contractor packs</p>
<p>up and leaves where the road falls into shambles and this government and the people go</p>
<p>scrambling around for more money to repair the road again.</p>
<p>(4) When will the weighing station that was constructed at 10 Mile in Lae be used?</p>
<p>(5) Does the Works Department have any plans to put up weighing stations in all of the</p>
<p>highways in the provinces to determine whether the allowable weight is being carried by</p>
<p>vehicles so that there are no further damages done to roads; considering that we always have</p>
<p>to scrape around to find money to maintain and rehabilitate roads?</p>
<p>Page 22:</p>
<p>16/05</p>
<p>When is it ever going to come into use? And does the Works Department have any plans</p>
<p>to put up weighing stations in all of the highways in the provinces and that will determine</p>
<p>whether the allowable weight is being carried by vehicles so that there are no further damages</p>
<p>done to roads considering that we always have to scrape around to find money to maintain and</p>
<p>rehabilitate roads.</p>
<p>Mr SOLAN MIRISIM - Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker. And I would like to thank</p>
<p>the Member for Kainantu for his question. I believe this is his second time to raise this question</p>
<p>and in response I would say that three weeks ago I was able to visit the Highlands highway,</p>
<p>the journey began in Mendi and was completed in Lae Morobe province and I witnessed first</p>
<p>hand the road conditions of the highland’s highway. ADB has given us a loan to maintain this</p>
<p>highway and work has begun in Lae in Bugandi. The four-lane work has begun and will be</p>
<p>completed at Nadzab, from the Nadzab road turn over will continue and end at Kagamuga in</p>
<p>Mt Hagen.</p>
<p>There are three contracts currently on this part of the road; there is one from Nadzab turn</p>
<p>over to where it ends in Henganofi, the other from where the Member for Kainantu raised the</p>
<p>question on. Before I continue, I want to assure the Member for Kainantu and the people of</p>
<p>Eastern highlands province and also about 5-6 provinces on the western side of the highland’s</p>
<p>highway. That in two years the road conditions along the Highland’s Highway will come to</p>
<p>high standard. The travelling hours will be reduced.</p>
<p>The ADB has its loan conditions as well as conditions on awarding of contracts. They</p>
<p>award the contracts to the contractor and the Department of Works only places managers to</p>
<p>work with alongside the contractors because under the connect PNG Law we have a set up and</p>
<p>the head office is based in Goroka. This is where we have the structure where all the contracted</p>
<p>are working with our ADB awarded contractors who report back to the government, ensuring</p>
<p>there is quality work and contractors are not sitting idle and meeting the standards set out by</p>
<p>ADB so, this is a brief to your first question.</p>
<p>I would like to assure the House and the people of this country that Works department does not</p>
<p>compromise, we put managers to work with the ADB contracts to ensure work monitoring and</p>
<p>report back to the government. You will note that the work is in progress and the road</p>
<p>conditions will gradually be better. From the Nadzab road turn over which will finish in</p>
<p>Henganofi bridge is about 207km and so it has been cut into three sections. That is from Nadzab</p>
<p>Page 23:</p>
<p>to Waterise and starting from Watarise up to Kassam Pass and all the way to Kainantu, the road</p>
<p>will be completed soon. The third phase is from Kainantu to Henganofi Bridge. I have talked</p>
<p>to the contractor to get more machines and men so that the work must be completed.</p>
<p>17/05</p>
<p>I want to assure the Member for Kainantu and the people of Eastern Highlands, that the</p>
<p>road will be delivered after October. This section of the road will be completed so that people</p>
<p>can travel.</p>
<p>In response to your second question about audits, we are currently working on it. We will</p>
<p>have professionals to go and conduct audits on every road in the Connect-PNG Program when</p>
<p>the contractors have completed them. We want value for money. This government is serious</p>
<p>about making sure that work must be done according to the money given. Audit teams are</p>
<p>already in place and will be starting to conduct audits on the roads from the monies given by</p>
<p>donors and the Connect-PNG Program.</p>
<p>The Department of Works have a plan in place to have weighing stations. Fees collected</p>
<p>from the weighing stations will be used to maintain the roads and bridges. The weighing</p>
<p>stations are in progress now to review for implementation.</p>
<p>While waiting for the government to give us money, we will also have money coming in.</p>
<p>These monies will be used to do emergency works; for instance, landslips do occur in some</p>
<p>bridges and roads anytime. We can be able to repair them because we do have money from</p>
<p>these projects. These are plans in place and we are working on it.</p>
<p>Let me assure the Member, his people in Eastern Highlands and the people of Papua New</p>
<p>Guinea that the Connect-PNG Program is real and it will be delivered. I want to let the Member</p>
<p>know that his road will be completed and soon he will not need to ask questions anymore. This</p>
<p>is also to inform other leaders and members from the Highlands Region and PNG as well.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER -— Honourable Members, question time have lapsed.</p>
