<p>CIVIL AVIATION SAFETY AUTHORITY — ANNUAL REPORTS FOR 2020</p>
<p>AND 2021 -PAPERS AND STATEMENT -PAPER NOTED</p>
<p>Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT (Namatanai—Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation)</p>
<p>—I present the following papers pursuant to statute:</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Safety Authority — Annual Reports for the years, 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>I ask leave of the Parliament to make a statement in connection with the Report.</p>
<p>Leave granted.</p>
<p>18/05</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to present in this</p>
<p>Honourable House, my statement on the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority</p>
<p>of Papua New Guinea in 2021 and 2020.</p>
<p>Page 25:</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I am pleased to present to Parliament, the 2021 CASA Annual</p>
<p>Report which is the 12" Annual Report of the Authority since its establishment in 2010 and the</p>
<p>Report includes the statement of the activities of the Authority during the year and the annual</p>
<p>financial statements of the Authority prepared under the Civil Aviation Act 2000 (as amended).</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG was unable to present its 2020 Annual Report to</p>
<p>Parliament in 2021, therefore, I am presenting it to Parliament along with the 2021 CASA</p>
<p>Annual Report. The 2020 Annual Report is the 11" Report of CASA since its establishment.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the operation of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Papua New</p>
<p>Guinea has again met the expectations of the Government, the aviation industry and the public,</p>
<p>in ensuring that safety and security is maintained and enhanced within an increasingly complex</p>
<p>and challenging environment.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG did not have a Board in 2021, due to circumstances</p>
<p>beyond the control of its management. The appointment and swearing in of the new Board of</p>
<p>Directors were recently completed. In 2020, a six-member Board, provided governance</p>
<p>oversight over CASA PNG. The then Board of Directors’ involvement in CASA PNG in 2020,</p>
<p>shaped and influenced the strategic direction for CASA PNG, as set out in the Corporate Plan</p>
<p>2020 2022.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, it is important that we have an effective and efficient aviation</p>
<p>safety and security regulator, because a safe aviation environment contributes towards social</p>
<p>and economic development of Papua New Guinea and raises PNG's profile at the international</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, building organization capability to meet the expectation of the</p>
<p>- aviation industry and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), continued to be</p>
<p>CASA PNG's challenges and I commend the CASA staff for continuing to perform</p>
<p>exceptionally well. The various programmes, objectives and targets being pursued under the</p>
<p>ICAO ‘No Country Left Behind’ initiative to assist States in capacity building also assisted</p>
<p>CASA PNG in 2021 and 2020.</p>
<p>19/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the ICAO Global Aviation Safety Plan (GASP) and Global Air</p>
<p>Navigation Plan (GANP), set out regional expectation priorities and targets for States to meet</p>
<p>the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP) Effective Implementation (El)</p>
<p>range of scores, in which the smaller Island States of the Pacific saw a compelling need for</p>
<p>Page 26:</p>
<p>improvement and CASA PNG is actively engaged in forging stronger regional cooperation,</p>
<p>partnerships and engagement in this area.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the direction and objectives for aviation safety and security in</p>
<p>PNG, follows the regional expectation and supports CASA's vision to be respected as an</p>
<p>industry regulator and as a partner in regional and international civil aviation and its mission</p>
<p>to promote compliance and achieve safety and security outcomes in PNG through positive and</p>
<p>productive engagement with its stakeholders.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA is a growing organisation facing a number of challenges in</p>
<p>the aviation environment which is evolutionary. Its strategic direction sets a clear pathway in</p>
<p>addressing the challenges and to facilitate change in a gradual, staged approach, allowing</p>
<p>CASA to absorb and benefit from these changes, assessing the risk before making the decision</p>
<p>to proceed with others.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, aviation safety regulation is a global operation, across borders, not</p>
<p>isolated to one country. The aviation challenges faced by PNG differ to those in other countries</p>
<p>and it is particularly beneficial for PNG to maintain its presence at the ICAO forums to</p>
<p>collaborate with other States on common aviation related issues.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, recent estimates suggest that demand for air transport will increase</p>
<p>by an average of 4.3 per cent per annum over the next 20 years. This growth is likely to pose</p>
<p>|       many challenges for PNG.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the rapid growth of the remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS)</p>
<p>and drones industry, has resulted in significant and multiple challenges for PNG, to deliver our</p>
<p>mandate and meet the needs and expectations of the industry. CASA has identified key areas</p>
<p>of concern and has reviewed and developed its operating rules that are being implemented.</p>
<p>CASA is continuing with its efforts to address the remotely piloted aircraft system (R-PAS)</p>
<p>oversight and surveillance, including capacity building of its inspectors and is improving</p>
<p>PNG's R-PAS regulations to ensure alignment with ICAO standards and recommended</p>
<p>practices (SARPs).</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, today, cyber threats are of growing concern to civil aviation and</p>
<p>CASA PNG is required to refocus its efforts for a proactive and aligned collective response.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, from CASA's perspective, new technologies and changes to the</p>
<p>aviation environment, have a significant impact on resources required to support technical</p>
<p>training for inspectors, development of new CASA policies and procedures, stakeholder</p>
<p>consultation and communications, and legislation development and implementation.</p>
<p>Page 27:</p>
<p>20/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, when safety and security incidents and serious incidents are</p>
<p>reported, the most serious incidents in aircraft accidents are investigated by the PNG Accident</p>
<p>Investigation Commission, to determine the root-cause factors that have contributed to the</p>
<p>incident, with the aim of preventing future occurrences.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG also uses these reports, to conduct trend analysis to</p>
<p>build a picture of how prevalent certain types of incidents are in different type of aviation</p>
<p>operations. This helps CASA to design policies, propose new safety standards and oversight</p>
<p>strategies to improve aviation safety and security.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, from a safety perspective, significant changes increase the risks</p>
<p>and CASA was able to mitigate these risks through regulatory interventions, increase</p>
<p>surveillance and imposition of conditions and implementation of a risk-based approach in</p>
<p>auditing.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA's Corporate Plan Key Objectives, sets the strategic</p>
<p>direction and either relies on or would benefit from regional and international engagement with</p>
<p>neighboring aviation regulators, to collaborate and adopt best practices that would assist PNG</p>
<p>in addressing the challenges and risks.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG's long-term objective is the implementation of a</p>
<p>robust civil aviation safety and security system, that will become integral to the civil aviation</p>
<p>systems of the future. CASA continues to assess the growth in the civil aviation sector,</p>
<p>domestically and globally, to identify emerging challenges and risks. The strategies on</p>
<p>addressing the challenges and mitigating the emerging risks, are set in its Corporate Plan to</p>
<p>ensure that it achieves its long-term objective.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, for benchmarking purposes and as an ongoing performance</p>
<p>indicator for investment, in 2021 PNG had an ICAO Effective Implementation score of 60.7</p>
<p>per cent for safety oversight, against a global average of 67.5 per cent. The scores are based on</p>
<p>an assessment of our responses to the eight critical elements of aviation safety, that addresses</p>
<p>the standards that set out in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention on International Civil</p>
<p>Aviation.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, Papua New Guinea maintained its aviation safety International</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Organization Effective Implementation target, above the Global Aviation Safety</p>
<p>Plan and the Asia Pacific Regional target of 60.1 per cent, and work is continuing on the</p>
<p>deficient areas to improve further, as PNG focus on the Beijing Declaration — a commitment</p>
<p>made by the Asia Pacific Civil Aviation Ministers in Beijing, to progressively enhance safety</p>
<p>Page 28:</p>
<p>oversight capability to achieve a Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme El score, higher</p>
<p>or equal to the global average by 2022.</p>
<p>21/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG continues to focus efforts towards improving the</p>
<p>ICAO El scores for both aviation safety and security. This includes achievements of full</p>
<p>implementation of the State Safety Programme and Safety Management System, to facilitate</p>
<p>the pro-active management of safety risks.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, Significant Safety Concerns (SSCs) indicates that a State Is not</p>
<p>providing sufficient safety oversight, to ensure the effective implementation of applicable</p>
<p>ICAO Standards. SSCs may be issued in the area of operations, air navigation services,</p>
<p>aerodromes, airworthiness or licensing. I am pleased to report that PNG has no significant</p>
<p>safety concerns.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, In the area of certification of International Aerodromes, ICAO</p>
<p>has considered that PNG has satisfactorily promulgated regulations detailing the</p>
<p>requirements for the certification of aerodromes, including establishing a process for the</p>
<p>certification of aerodromes.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG has not been assessed by the Federate Aviation</p>
<p>”       Administration (FAA), through their International Aviation Safety Audit (IASA)</p>
<p>programme. This is a long-term strategy that CASA will now be embarking on with the</p>
<p>airlines.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG has no operational restrictions with regard to European</p>
<p>airspace and PNG has only one airline (Air Niugini) certified through the International Air</p>
<p>Transport Association Operational Safety Audit (OSA) programme.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, In the area of State Safety (SSP) Implementation, PNG is at</p>
<p>level three at 95.2 per cent above the target and moving towards level four. Our overall SSP</p>
<p>foundation is currently at 91.19 per cent. The full implementation of SSP is now part of</p>
<p>CASA's strategy, following the attainment of over 60% Effective Implementation score.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the implementation of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN)</p>
<p>is presently the global aviation community's highest air navigation priority, The PBN</p>
<p>concept offers significant benefits including improved safety through more straight-in</p>
<p>instrument approaches with vertical guidance, increased airspace capacity, increased airport</p>
<p>accessibility, more efficient operations, reduced infrastructure costs and reduced</p>
<p>environmental impact. PNG's international airports have two (2) instrument runways which</p>
<p>Page 29:</p>
<p>have two (2) PBN approaches that result in our PBN implementation ICAO rating at 100</p>
<p>per cent.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA continued in 2021 with its data-driven, risk-based</p>
<p>approach, to proactively monitor emerging safety trends within each certificated</p>
<p>organization in PNG. The monitoring of trends, enabled CASA to allocate its limited human</p>
<p>resources to focus on high-risk areas and measure the effectiveness of its safety certification</p>
<p>audit and surveillance program.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the results of CASA's trend analysis of aviation safety and security</p>
<p>data, enables CASA to engage with the industry by communicating "issues of concern" directly</p>
<p>to each air operator and/or take the appropriate enforcement action, to prevent incidents or</p>
<p>accidents from happening.</p>
<p>22/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, through trend analysis and risk-based approach auditing; CASA</p>
<p>was able to monitor any ‘build up’ of latent unsafe conditions within each organization in a</p>
<p>timely manner.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, statistics for the last seven years indicated a slight fluctuation in</p>
<p>the number of serious incidents and bird-strikes, however, the trend analysis shows a steady</p>
<p>,         trend during that period,</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the number of serious incidents reported to CASA by the industry,</p>
<p>decreased from 108 in 2020 to 98 in 2021.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, significant achievements have also been achieved by the</p>
<p>Authority, demonstrated by the completion of the audit of the Financial Statements of CASA</p>
<p>for year ended 31st December 2021 and year ended 31st December 2020, and the results of the</p>
<p>audits from the Auditor-General forwarded to my Office, advising me of the results of his</p>
<p>inspection.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA regulates aviation participants within PNG, with a very</p>
<p>modern set of legislative framework that meets international best practices in aviation safety.</p>
<p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has rated Papua New Guinea as having</p>
<p>one of the best piece of Primary Aviation Safety legislation (the Act) in place.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, reviews of subordinate aviation safety rules set, that are linked to</p>
<p>support the primary legislation, were also conducted and completed in 2021 and 2020</p>
<p>respectively, following consultation with the aviation industry and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Page 30:</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG is a strong advocate for the Pacific region on aviation safety</p>
<p>and security matters. We continue to play a significant leading role among the smaller Pacific</p>
<p>island states, through the Regional Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO); a regional body</p>
<p>established by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders, to ensure aviation safety and security</p>
<p>oversight is effective in order to meet the international obligations required of us, under the</p>
<p>ICAO Convention on International Civil Aviation.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, as a member of PASO, it is particularly beneficial for PNG to</p>
<p>maintain its presence at PASO meetings, to collaborate with other smaller Pacific island states</p>
<p>on common aviation-related issues and challenges.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG's leadership supports our platform to be a partner in regional</p>
<p>and international civil aviation and further demonstrates our credibility in this very highly</p>
<p>technical and specialized field, commensurate with the extensive aviation infrastructures we</p>
<p>have in PNG.</p>
<p>23/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA has safety-related functions aimed at encouraging the</p>
<p>aviation industry to maintain and enhance high standards of safety, through compliance with</p>
<p>the appropriate rules and the development and evolution of a safety culture. CASA undertakes</p>
<p>these functions. Through accurate and timely aviation safety advice; comprehensive safety</p>
<p>education and training programs; and fostering awareness within the industry and the</p>
<p>community, on the fundamental importance of aviation safety.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, as CASA's stakeholders and clients are individuals or groups</p>
<p>who are affected by a CASA activity, CASA has a large and diverse number of stakeholders,</p>
<p>clients, and safety partners. Its approach to stakeholder engagement sits within a key objective</p>
<p>of its Corporate Plan and is guided by its vision, mission, and values.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, as part of itss strategies to engage with stakeholders CASA</p>
<p>successfully hosted the 2021 Annual High-Level Aviation Safety and Security Conference</p>
<p>virtually, with action items tracked. The theme of the Conference: "Adapting &amp; Digital</p>
<p>Sustaining PNG Aviation amidst the Pandemic", enabled the participants to discuss</p>
<p>fundamentals that were a pillar for adaptation and sustainability in the aviation sector during</p>
<p>any given pandemic. It was important that policymakers, regulators, and the aviation industry</p>
<p>collaborate together, to ensure appropriate policies and legislative framework is established for</p>
<p>the industry in PNG. A total of 125 participants took part in the Conference with a good</p>
<p>representation from international organizations, including the PNG Department of PM &amp; NEC,</p>
<p>Page 31:</p>
<p>the Department of Transport, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Civil Aviation</p>
<p>Minister's Office.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, in the area of aviation security oversight, CASA has increased</p>
<p>the allocation of resources to its Aviation Security Branch, to ensure effort is put into</p>
<p>addressing the protocol questions and the three Significant Security Concerns (SSeCs), in the</p>
<p>areas of Airport Operations, Passenger and Baggage, Security and Cargo, which were identified</p>
<p>by a Combined Assistance Technical Mission in 2019. Monthly progress reports are being sent</p>
<p>to ICAO, providing updates on the implementation of PNG's Corrective Action Plan.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the 2021 Recurrent Budget appropriation of K15.2 million was</p>
<p>a decrease of 3.5 per cent from the 2020 appropriation of K15.8 million, CASA PNG continued</p>
<p>to face inconsistencies in the grant disbursement in 2021 and 2020.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA implemented measures to counteract this reduction, as</p>
<p>well as, the inconsistencies of the grant disbursement, to ensure that funding did not erode</p>
<p>further to a point where, it would seriously impact aviation safety and security oversight</p>
<p>responsibilities and has vigorously pursued its outstanding debts.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, in terms of staff liabilities, there were no outstanding staff</p>
<p>liabilities, apart from the payments made to staff exiting the organization through resignation,</p>
<p>medical condition, or contract expiration, in 2021 and 2020. Provisions are maintained for</p>
<p>accrued gratuities, annual leave, and long service leave.</p>
<p>24/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG's organisation structure and approved positions</p>
<p>remained at 104 positions. This has remained for the last three years and while CASA is</p>
<p>continually seeking from the government for more positions, it has been very difficult to obtain</p>
<p>approval.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG's management is committed to ensuring that the</p>
<p>organisation is appropriately staffed with qualified and experienced personnel, capable of</p>
<p>successfully undertaking the wide variety of required regulatory task, but they are being</p>
<p>hampered by the limited number of positions which are not allowing the organisation to grow</p>
<p>together with growth in the industry.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, it is important that the functions of CASA are recognised and</p>
<p>supported to ensure growth commensurate with industry growth and that it can attract and</p>
<p>retain qualified, experienced and skilled staff to ensure that the organization is credible and</p>
<p>respected when it interacts with the industry.</p>
<p>Page 32:</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the increase in organisation’s position to permit increase in staff</p>
<p>number, is therefore critical in light of a significant increase in the volume and scope of aviation</p>
<p>activities including improvements in technology in PNG.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, the functions of CASA PNG and its strategic direction are</p>
<p>consistent with the Government's development agenda and is aligned with and support the</p>
<p>achievement of the government goals for aviation safety and security. It includes consistency</p>
<p>with PNG's Vision 2050 and the Transport Sector goal for "a well-integrated, competitive, safe,</p>
<p>affordable, financially and environmentally sustainable transport system that efficiently serves</p>
<p>the economy and society of Papua New Guinea".</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, finally, for this Government, the safety and security of the</p>
<p>travelling public is the most important priority. The public expects us, the Government to be</p>
<p>responsible in ensuring that aeroplanes are safe to fly, the airports are safe to operate into and</p>
<p>the associated aeronautical infrastructure are modernized and meets international standards.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I commend the 2021 and 2020 Annual Reports provided by the</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Papua New Guinea and ask the Government to lend its</p>
<p>support to this very important safety agency.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr LUTHER WENGE (Morobe) — I move —</p>
<p>That Parliament take note of the paper.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. I thank you for giving me this opportunity to make</p>
<p>few debates in relation to the Report of Civil Aviation and Safety Authority in our country,</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>25/05</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Civil Aviation Safety</p>
<p>Authority report presented by the Minister for Civil Aviation, which extends to the world its</p>
<p>operations because Papua New Guinea is not alone; we are a member of the international</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p>Mr Minister and Mr Assistant Speaker, I’d like to thank the Minister for providing</p>
<p>succinctly the situation in relation to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and secondly,</p>
<p>comprehensively providing the report that this parliament should know and should disseminate</p>
<p>to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Page 33:</p>
<p>As I said, Mr Assistant Speaker, we are not alone, Papua New Guinea is not alone,</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea is a member of the international community, especially in the manner in</p>
<p>which we operate, particularly in relation to aerodrome safety or safety of aerodrome operators,</p>
<p>safety of pilots flying from PNG and to the international community, and the safety of the</p>
<p>travelling public flying to and from PNG and to the international community, as well as</p>
<p>monitoring criminal acts which we call cyber-crime from coming into this country and into the</p>
<p>operations or mechanical operations of aircraft and other apparatus and machines that we have</p>
<p>and how it affects them.</p>
<p>I thank the Minister for providing this to parliament, especially in relation to the</p>
<p>Government’s commitment to provide money to train people who are working in specialised</p>
<p>areas that | have mentioned, to make sure that they are competent and experienced in making</p>
<p>sure that the operations they’re required to perform are provided in the best possible way so</p>
<p>that safety is guaranteed to the users of the aircraft and anything that is relevant.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I’m also happy with the Office of Auditor-General, the</p>
<p>constitutional established office that audit books of government operations in this country.</p>
<p>They have done the audits to make sure that there is compliance by CASA. And I’m happy to</p>
<p>know that CASA has complied with the utility of the money that is provided and also any other</p>
<p>apparatus that is relevant to the operation of the aircraft, et cetera have been audited.</p>
<p>And I’m’ happy to know from the Minister that there is no misuse of money in the</p>
<p>operations. And, Mr Minister, Mr Assistant Speaker, that is what this country needs to know.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, there is no question, our record is good and I fully concur with</p>
<p>the Minister’s presentation that we are in order. We are in order as to all those machineries,</p>
<p>apparatus, aerodrome and the pilots and all those people who are trying to make sure that</p>
<p>operation of all those things are in order. I’m happy to know that there’s not much problem in</p>
<p>this country.</p>
<p>26/05</p>
<p>Not many accidents occurred in relation to Air Niugini. There is probably only one in</p>
<p>Madang but it was from a technical fault, there were no casualties. The plane was damaged but</p>
<p>all the passengers were safe. Furthermore, one of the aircrafts sank into the water in one of the</p>
<p>Micronesian countries and again there were no serious casualties and everyone including the</p>
<p>pilot were safe.</p>
<p>Mr Minister, you are reporting on the competency of the people who are working there</p>
<p>and their compliance. The compliance of the rules by those people working there is excellent.</p>
<p>Page 34:</p>
<p>They ensure that the aircraft is running well and that it reaches its destination safely. The</p>
<p>passengers are well taken care for, including international passengers and lands at international</p>
<p>destinations without difficulties, this very good news.</p>
<p>I am happy to note that none of our pilots have made any mistakes while flying</p>
<p>internationally, as they are well trained and are able to manage the aircraft and they are able to</p>
<p>manage the topography of the countries they are travelling to and from. They manage to</p>
<p>maneuver the plain against the wind and other airborne conditions that aircrafts face. I want to</p>
<p>say our pilots have a good record and there is no question about that as we already gained the</p>
<p>respect of the international community. We heard about the Malaysian plane that crashed,</p>
<p>probably it was interfered by cyber-attack that caused it to crash where no body survived. We</p>
<p>here of air crashes in Turkey, Russia and even in well advanced countries. And they have a</p>
<p>record of their planes crashing.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, with this record of only two minor crashes and no casualties we</p>
<p>have a very good record. In line with Nadzab that is gearing up to be an international terminal,</p>
<p>I take this time to thank this government and the others who were instrumental I making this</p>
<p>project possible, as well as grants from the Japanese Government to assist in upgrading Nadzab</p>
<p>to international status.</p>
<p>With this confidence when we sanctioned the Nadzab International Airport we should fly</p>
<p>direct to some of the countries that will allow our national aircraft carrier Air Niugini and that</p>
<p>will help us build the economy of our country. We will need direct flights to China, Japan,</p>
<p>Philippines and to Australia and the rest of the Pacific nations.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I am sure when the Nadzab International Airport is inaugurated</p>
<p>the I am sure you will endorse those flights and surely, I will be requesting those international</p>
<p>connections to and from Nadzab. Therefore, on that basis we should fly direct from Nadzab to</p>
<p>other international destinations and we do not have to enroute to Jacksons International Airport.</p>
<p>27/05</p>
<p>When people ask you where you are travelling from, you will say directly from Kandep.</p>
<p>The people from Sepik, Bougainville and the Highlands regions too can travel directly from</p>
<p>where they are instead of transiting through Port Moresby.</p>
<p>The Minister has assured us through his report that our planes are safe, as well as the</p>
<p>people operating the aircrafts. People are complying with the Civil Aviation laws in PNG as</p>
<p>well as the international laws.</p>
<p>Page 35:</p>
<p>We have the respect and trust from our country and also from the international</p>
<p>community that our planes are safe. The stewards and stewardess will make sure that we fly</p>
<p>safely. We have a track record since independence. Since Air Niugini started operations in the</p>
<p>country, they have experienced only two crash.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Minister, for assuring the country that our safety is guaranteed when we</p>
<p>fly with our airlines. We have to set standards on our safety when travelling by road, sea and</p>
<p>in the air. Investors coming in will be guaranteed and will be confident to do business with us.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for allowing me to speak. I want to commend the</p>
<p>Minister and his staff for the report, and also to offer my support to him.</p>
<p>Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA (Kiriwina-Goodenough) — Thank you, Mr Assistant</p>
<p>Speaker. I also want to commend the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation for a well-</p>
<p>presented report. I am sure that the people of Papua New Guinea are happy, as well as the</p>
<p>travelling public.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I will try to make my debate short. On page five of the report, it</p>
<p>shows very high ratings from the travelling public. We are slowly moving from three up to</p>
<p>four. This report gives comfort to the travelling public, as well as the leaders present here too.</p>
<p>Many a times, we express negativity towards the operators of our airlines. At this</p>
<p>juncture, I want to commend CASA for doing a great job with its continuous endeavours to</p>
<p>make certain that as an organization involved with the airline industry, performs at the highest</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>28/05</p>
<p>I wish to commend CASA, with its limited funding it continues to perform at the</p>
<p>International Level Standard set by the airline industry and continues to perform at that level.</p>
<p>As a traveller of this airline, today’s report gives me assurance that I have an eye watching</p>
<p>the industry and that is CASA. CASA continues to perform its duties and for this House to</p>
<p>report for the rest of Papua New Guinea to hear, is very encouraging. It gives the traveling</p>
<p>public comfort and confidence that one of the safest mode of travel would be the airline</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>There are many times we hear about boats sinking and cars crashing which becomes</p>
<p>like a monthly occurrence but in the airline industry there are very minimal accidents. CASA</p>
<p>is performing their mandated responsibility as a regulator in the airline industry. And now it</p>
<p>Page 36:</p>
<p>presents us with a challenge of the performance of Air Niugini, Airlines PNG and other third-</p>
<p>level airline operators.</p>
<p>I would like to commend CASA, that with the very limited funding as we know from</p>
<p>the budgets but it continues to perform and today gives us that confidence and endeavour as a</p>
<p>House to support this industry.</p>
<p>I would like to also take this opportunity to commend the management of CASA with</p>
<p>this report that was presented today. We heard the Prime Minister talk about corruption where</p>
<p>ICAC and the Police were involved but here we have an organization that does not owe</p>
<p>anybody any money. This is the type of reports we want to hear from organizations because</p>
<p>now it gives other organizations the challenge to be like CASA. How many organizations can</p>
<p>come out with positive reports like this?</p>
<p>Today’s report gives us a time that we can ponder upon and discuss that a government</p>
<p>organization is performing well. There is nothing negative that I can say here but I would like</p>
<p>to contribute in saying that now CASA gives the challenge to Air Niugini, Airlines PNG and</p>
<p>other third-level airlines to rise to the occasion to meet the challenges that CASA has outlined</p>
<p>in the report.</p>
<p>Finally, before I sit, let me once again congratulate CASA for this report and I would</p>
<p>also want to thank the Minister, and the previous ministers for a job well done.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr SAM BASIL JNR (Bulolo) — Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker for allowing me</p>
<p>to speak on my first debate as the new Member for Bulolo.</p>
<p>Mr Assistant Speaker, I am a commercial holder and I feel that I have to speak on this</p>
<p>report. I would like to thank the Minister for Civil Aviation and CASA PNG.</p>
<p>29/05</p>
<p>I commend the report and I will make a few remarks which I know will add value to the</p>
<p>report presented by the Minister in relation to CASA PNG.</p>
<p>The reason being that CASA must have teeth when in operation and the general public</p>
<p>must follow its rules and guidelines by taking lead in safety of the aviation industry. It’s no</p>
<p>good hearing about service providers ignoring the rules and guidelines of CASA.</p>
<p>In relation to that I will elaborate on the aviation documents which doesn’t concerns the</p>
<p>pilots only but includes the security firms engaged inside and outside of the precincts of the</p>
<p>airport. And that brings back to fit and proper persons which covers everyone from operators,</p>
<p>Page 37:</p>
<p>pilots and the security guards manning the gates. They all must be protected under the fit and</p>
<p>proper guidelines to carry out their duties. If they are not properly guided by the rules then</p>
<p>disruptions of operations can happen such as security firms disrupting the flights.</p>
<p>I am glad that the Minister has presented a good report regarding CASA which we all</p>
<p>agreed on. But at the same time CASA must be a leader in aviation industry, especially in</p>
<p>security and safety which means sticking to that name by enforcing it.</p>
<p>The other point is on third-level airline operators; I] personally think that most of them</p>
<p>are not properly operated therefore I recommend CASA to monitor them closely because most</p>
<p>of them operate on visual flight rules (VFR) so they must have all the necessary documents in</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>The other thing I have noticed missing is we don’t have aeronautical information</p>
<p>publication (AIP). It must be current because the aerodrome normally guides the pilots to stick</p>
<p>within the spot to land, park and where to refill. All these important information is provided by</p>
<p>this aerodrome and it’s called the ‘bible’ of the pilots.</p>
<p>Not all pilots train in one particular school to become pilots, they get their training in</p>
<p>different countries to get their licenses. Therefore, CASA must take lead in standardizing all</p>
<p>the aviation laws under the guidance of IKO so everybody will follow this standard instead of</p>
<p>operating individually.</p>
<p>That’s all I want to contribute and I commend the report. I also thank the hardworking</p>
<p>officers of CASA for bringing safety to PNG and the international fights.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Motion (by Mr Keith Iduhu) — put</p>
<p>That the question be now put.</p>
<p>Motion — That the Parliament take note of the paper — agreed to.</p>
