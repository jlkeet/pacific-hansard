<p>Mr JOE SUNGI (Nuku—Minister for Public Service) — I move —</p>
<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, today is an important moment for me to present on behalf of the Prime</p>
<p>Minister and the Marape-Rosso Government, the amendment to the Pacific Institute of Leadership</p>
<p>and Governance Act.</p>
<p>The institution was first established in 1963 as the first Papua New Guinea Administrative</p>
<p>College before it became Papua New Guinea Institute of Public Administration under the PNGIPA</p>
<p>Act 1993. Then in 2017, the Parliament had repealed the entire PNGIPA Act 1993 and replaced it</p>
<p>with the Pacific Institute of Leadership and Governance Act of 2017, which came into full effect</p>
<p>and operation in April 2018.</p>
<p>In the process of implementing this legislation, the PILAG interim board and the</p>
<p>management have encountered certain legal oversight challenges and gaps in specific provisions</p>
<p>of the Act which required it to be amended or repealed.</p>
<p>03/04</p>
<p>The first impediment area of concern was to do with the transitional provisions of the Act</p>
<p>that regulated the transition period from PNGIPA to PILAG, which were all achieved and not</p>
<p>applicable at present.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the other important legal and policy issue to be addressed by this</p>
<p>amendment is the status and appointment process of the PILAG Board Chairperson and Deputy</p>
<p>Chairperson, which was not clearly defined in the principal Act.</p>
<p>The amendment provides that the Chairperson of the Board shall be the Departmental Head</p>
<p>responsible for Personnel Management whilst the Deputy Chairperson shall be a representative</p>
<p>from either the National Training Council (NTC) or the Department of Higher Education,</p>
<p>Research, Science and Technology (DHERST). This is to ensure that there is continuity and</p>
<p>coordination of the government’s public service training policies and the implementation and</p>
<p>monitoring of the public service training program which is one of the national government's KRAs.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the significant amendment is the change of name of the institution</p>
<p>from the Pacific Institute of Leadership and Governance to the Somare Institute of Leadership and</p>
<p>Governance (PILAG to SILAG). It is the Executive Government's intent and wisdom to rename</p>
<p>this premier government training institution to portray and give prominence in commemoration of</p>
<p>the founding father and first Prime Minister of this country.</p>
<p>Page 6:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, may I add that Papua New Guinea commemorated the late Sir Michael</p>
<p>Somare’s second death Anniversary on 26 February. The late Grand Chief entered the</p>
<p>Administrative College as it used to be known in 1965, as one of its first students, and soon after</p>
<p>that, they established the civil service. Rightfully the name makes all sense to honour the Father</p>
<p>of this country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the only new part of this legislative amendment is to do with the</p>
<p>establishment of the PILAG Academic Committee, its composition, and functions. The committee</p>
<p>consists of professional academics and members representing core arms of training within the</p>
<p>institution</p>
<p>NEC Decision No: NG86/2022</p>
<p>The decision for the amendment and the repeal of certain provisions of the PILAG Act 2017</p>
<p>is to improve the efficiency of the institute to achieve its objectives and functions, as originally</p>
<p>envisioned.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the institute will have a permanent board in place after the amendment</p>
<p>of this Act. The board shall exercise the power to direct the affairs of the institution with the</p>
<p>Executive Management of the Institute.</p>
<p>Currently, there are some legal and policy constraints at times that affect the Interim Board</p>
<p>from fully exercising its authority in making policy decisions to ensure that PILAG becomes a</p>
<p>fully-fledged regulatory body for training public servants, partners, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the PILAG Act 2017 does not also define and establish a body that</p>
<p>oversees and coordinates the academic aspects of the Institution; therefore, it has caused a vacuum.</p>
<p>04/04</p>
<p>The insertion of this new part in the bill shall establish the economic committee which shall</p>
<p>exercise governance over the economic programs and regulations responsible for the maintenance</p>
<p>of the standard of admission, training, research and conferment of academic awards.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I am confident that this amendment will improve the institution in its</p>
<p>functions with efficient management and leadership from the Board and its Management.</p>
<p>Therefore, on behalf of the Marape-Rosso Government, I endorse the passing of this bill.</p>
<p>Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE (Pomio) - Mr Acting Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition we</p>
<p>would like to firstly, accept the amendment made to the 2023 PILAG Act and then would like to</p>
<p>contribute with a debate on this particular bill.</p>
<p>Page 7:</p>
<p>The amendment bill of PILAG Act of 2023 is fully commendable and it is appropriate that</p>
<p>this amendment is made in place to have a permanent board to direct the affairs of the institute and</p>
<p>an academic committee responsible for the maintenance of the standards, training, research and</p>
<p>conferment of academic awards. While we appreciate the amendments, I must place on records</p>
<p>our acknowledgements and appreciation of the initial fundamentals that were set by Honorable</p>
<p>Pila Niningi, who was then the Minister for Higher Education, Science Research and Technology</p>
<p>in partnership with Honorable Julie Bishop, then was the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia.</p>
<p>The PILAG precinct is a partnership between the Government of PNG and Australia to</p>
<p>support the development of ethical and capable public and private sector leaders in PNG public</p>
<p>service. It is aimed at improving governance and service delivery at the national, provincial and</p>
<p>the district level encouraging value-based decision making especially in PNG public service. |</p>
<p>support the change of name from PILAG to Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance on</p>
<p>behalf of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the Grand Chief and the Father of this nation’s legacy must live on</p>
<p>through our generations, especially in the implementation of the Vision 2050, with the targets</p>
<p>under the seven pillars. At self-Government in 1973, then as the Chief Minister, the late Grand</p>
<p>Chief commissioned what commissioned the development of what became the eight aims and later</p>
<p>renamed as the Eight-Point Plan.</p>
<p>The Eight-Point Plan was a statement of intent by the founding fathers of our nation who</p>
<p>wanted to build a peaceful harmonious society as well as to empower our people. The objectives</p>
<p>of the Eight-Point Plan was first to increase indigenous participation in the economy, secondly,</p>
<p>equality among the ethnic groups and gender and thirdly greater attention to rural and village</p>
<p>development and self-reliance. All of these formed the preamble of our National Constitution,</p>
<p>especially the National Goals and Directive Principles. They are relevant even today, nearly 48</p>
<p>years after our country gained independence.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I commend the Marape-Rosso Government through the Minister for</p>
<p>Public Service for the change of name from PILAG to SILAG. In this we are implementing the</p>
<p>Vision 2050 pillar No.1, the Human Development, Gender, Youth and People Empowerment. The</p>
<p>Public Sector requirements also calls for all senior public servants that must hold a Master’s</p>
<p>Degree or equivalent. To convert PNG IPA to Somare School of Government as according to page</p>
<p>24 of the Vision, it is imperative that we maintain the institute of leadership and governance to</p>
<p>give prominence to the agreed precinct, partnership with the Australia Public Service Commission,</p>
<p>the DHERST, UPNG School of Business, Public Policy and DPM.</p>
<p>Page 8:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, this brings me to my next point on section 26 (b) on the composition</p>
<p>of the academic committee. It says that the CEO shall be the chairperson, the director of workforce</p>
<p>training and development, heads of academic departments of the institute, librarian and professors</p>
<p>of the institute and the course coordinators of the institute will make up the committee.</p>
<p>05/04</p>
<p>Firstly, this is an important training institution so whoever that becomes the CEO, must</p>
<p>hold a doctorate or PHD to leave a credibility and the standard of this institute. My view is to take</p>
<p>on board and include the appropriate represent Master’s from the DHERST and UPNG School of</p>
<p>Business and Public Policy to the academic committee as well. We must also include the PNG</p>
<p>Public Service Commission. They are required under section 191 of the National Constitution to</p>
<p>maintain an ongoing review of state services and to make recommendations to NEC.</p>
<p>Our Public Service Commission must review its operations and contribute to the</p>
<p>curriculum development and workforce standards in our country. The Pacific Leadership of</p>
<p>Governance precinct emphasised on leadership ethics and values, and is supported by the</p>
<p>Australian Public Service Commission.</p>
<p>The PNG counterparts at the moment, spend most of their time dealing with review of</p>
<p>personal matters, which they must improve on. There is a significant need to review the operations</p>
<p>so they align themselves to the government’s priorities on the human resource development of our</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, in conclusion, we thank the Government of Australia through DFAT</p>
<p>for their on-going support. We also acknowledge the Department of Personnel Management and</p>
<p>CEO of PILAG, and this government that met today for this particular Bill.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Motion — That the question be put — agreed to.</p>
<p>Motion — That the Bill be now read a second time — agreed to.</p>
<p>Bill read a second time.</p>
