<p>ANSWER TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS</p>
<p>Mr SOROI EOE (Kikori-Minister for Provincial and Local-Level Government Affairs) —</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I seek leave of Parliament to respond to questions asked by</p>
<p>honorable Member for Kerowagi on the 11" of January this year, which were repeated today.</p>
<p>Leave granted.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Member</p>
<p>for Kerowagi on this question without notice that was asked on the 11" of January 2023 regarding</p>
<p>the status of Rural Service Development Project or RSDP in Kerowagi electorate of Chimbu</p>
<p>Province and elsewhere in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>I] then assured the Honorable Member and the House that I will seek advice from the</p>
<p>department and respond to the Member in that sitting of the Parliament or later sitting. However,</p>
<p>this didn’t transpire because I felt ill in that session hence, I will now respond.</p>
<p>By way of background, I wish to inform the Member and this Honorable House that RSDP</p>
<p>is a World Bank funded rural service delivery program that complements DSIP and PSIP projects.</p>
<p>The National Government secured a concessional loan of $23 million in 2017 from the World</p>
<p>Bank for this important project.</p>
<p>The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs is the implementing</p>
<p>and oversight agency of this project which aims to implement tangible projects identified by local</p>
<p>communities themselves at ward level based on priorities and the needs of those communities. The</p>
<p>desired outcome of RSDP is empowering and transforming rural communities to improve qualities</p>
<p>of life there.</p>
<p>For the last four years, we have had drawn down nearly 30 per cent of the World Bank</p>
<p>funding for total of 256 project proposals throughout the nation particularly those provinces that</p>
<p>are involved. There have been delays in projects implementation due to external causes such as</p>
<p>Page 27:</p>
<p>Covid-19 and the National Election that recently concluded, impacting on the overall delivery of</p>
<p>the project along with internal challenges.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the program is currently being implemented in five provinces Central,</p>
<p>East New Britain, Chimbu, Western and West Sepik. A total of 19 districts and 20 LLGs in these</p>
<p>provinces are participating in these important projects. Some of 256 project proposals have been</p>
<p>identified out of which 29 are targeted at women’s grouping.</p>
<p>19/04</p>
<p>Examples of these community projects are construction of aid post, construction of</p>
<p>classrooms and teachers houses, water catchments projects, bridges, community halls, and solar</p>
<p>power and livelihood projects for women and mothers.</p>
<p>East New Britain Province is the only province that is into the implementation phase,</p>
<p>starting with Raluana LLG, followed by Simbu Province and Central and Western who are</p>
<p>however not far away from this full implementation of this project.</p>
<p>There is LLG counterpart contribution an amount of K70 000 that is required. These funds</p>
<p>are equally shared with selected wards and when total project funding for each project proposals</p>
<p>at ward level is finally vetted by the communities. My department is working with all levels of</p>
<p>government to try and make systems of Government work in the provinces, districts, LLGs and</p>
<p>including wards. And this project is one of the most important intervention to make sure projects</p>
<p>at ward levels are delivered.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, Chimbu Province alone has the highest number of project proposals</p>
<p>numbering up to 53 in total that are awaiting draw down of funds from the World Bank. A total of</p>
<p>four LLG’s in the province are participating in four districts namely Kumai Bomai LLG in</p>
<p>Gumine, Suai LLG in Sinasina-Yonggomugl, Siana LLG in Chuave and Gena Wagula LLG in</p>
<p>Kerowagi. The selection of districts and LLG projects were done by the provincial administration.</p>
<p>Whilst all the wards had the opportunity to submit their expression of interests, Kerowagi had only</p>
<p>14 project proposals including two women groups that were identified and selected by</p>
<p>communities and approved. During the first quarter of this year, my department will carry out</p>
<p>outstanding activities that will need to be completed in Kerowagi district and the Chimbu province</p>
<p>as a whole. My department to complete development committee followed by LLG development</p>
<p>committee endorsement. Once this project is completed we will move into ward development grant</p>
<p>agreement signing to open ward accounts to transfer funds to start implementing the actual</p>
<p>projects. I want to assure the Honourable Member that process of Kerowagi will be undertaken in</p>
<p>Page 28:</p>
<p>the first quarter of this year. A total cost of 14 project proposal for his district is estimated at around</p>
<p>K1.2 million.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I must also inform the Honorable Member that part of the delay is also</p>
<p>due to following stringent financial management guidelines put in place by World Bank and as the</p>
<p>implementing agency we are in compliance thus my department only receives funds if and when</p>
<p>we acquit projects related expenses to the World Bank. Likewise, these experiences are also passed</p>
<p>down through our communities throughout the country. I hope that clarifies the status of this</p>
<p>project for Member for Kerowagi.</p>
<p>I thank the House for listening</p>
