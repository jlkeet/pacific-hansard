<p>FOURTH DAY</p>
<p>Friday, 17 March 2023</p>
<p>The Acting Speaker (Mr Koni Iguan) took the Chair at 10.a.m.</p>
<p>There being no quorum present, the Acting Speaker stated that he would resume the Chair</p>
<p>after the ringing of the Bells.</p>
<p>Sitting suspended.</p>
<p>The Acting Speaker again took the Chair at 10.43 a.m., and invited the Member for Central</p>
<p>Bougainville, Honourable Simon Dumarinu, to say Prayers.</p>
<p>“God the Father, we thank you for bringing us together again in this session. We ask for</p>
<p>your Spirit and strength as you are our Creator and our Maker. You were our Creator in the</p>
<p>beginning. In the scripture, in the Old Testament, you placed men to continue your creation in life</p>
<p>and that has gone on until it became a failure. But you sent your Son, Jesus to continue to redeem</p>
<p>and save us and that work of his has continued on until today, especially in the churches and in the</p>
<p>leadership and in the government.</p>
<p>Today we pray, in this session, for our leadership in the country especially the Prime</p>
<p>Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, ministers, members, and we also pray for the leadership in the</p>
<p>Opposition on the other side for us together, for our intention of being here before you today.</p>
<p>Whatever it is we share today in this Parliament, continue under your guidance and strength for us</p>
<p>whatever business we have before us.</p>
<p>God the Father, we pray for the work that we are going to do and we also pray for the</p>
<p>country and pray for those challenges before us, those areas that we need to continue to put in order,</p>
<p>the leadership that we are in, that tasked to do especially through this important House as members</p>
<p>through the law and the decisions and the policy laws that we make through this Parliament. So we</p>
<p>ask for your guidance and protection through this session and may you continue to guide us. Amen’</p>
