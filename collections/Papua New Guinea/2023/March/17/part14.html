<p>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</p>
<p>Question proposed —</p>
<p>That grievances be noted.</p>
<p>20/04</p>
<p>Gender-Based Violence</p>
<p>Sir JULIUS CHAN (New Ireland) — Thank you Mr Acting Speaker and thank you</p>
<p>Governor of East Sepik. I actually beat you to standing up, really. You may be fit but I actually</p>
<p>beat you. Thank you. I’m not going to be very long with the Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Few weeks ago, we had a big demonstration here on gender violence and I’m going to try</p>
<p>to say a few words just to remind us that there is a problem. The recent initiative in combatting</p>
<p>gender-based violence, GBV, as it is, how each province, particularly my own province should</p>
<p>respond and should have a strategy for it, it’s no good to just simply demonstrate, see and do</p>
<p>nothing. The fact of the matter is it is very, very important, gender-based violence is a very serious</p>
<p>problem in Papua New Guinea. Our women have suffered and you don’t know but they’re some</p>
<p>of the most patient creature on this earth.</p>
<p>The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals say the magnitude of gender-based</p>
<p>violence, GBV, incidence in Papua New Guinea is considered by some of the epidemic</p>
<p>proportions. Over 41 per cent of men in Papua New Guinea admit to having raped someone and</p>
<p>over two-thirds of women are estimated to have suffered some form of physical or sexual violence.</p>
<p>It’s very, very serious. We are among the top of the world for this kind of activities. Looks</p>
<p>like we’re very much on the side of animals and the report goes on to note that GBV is considered</p>
<p>Page 29:</p>
<p>by many Papua New Guineans to be an acceptable normal part of life, which means that the levels</p>
<p>reported are probably low. The actual level of GBV is much higher than reported.</p>
<p>GBV and gender equality in general are major issues that need to be addressed in Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea by all of us leaders who are elected to this Parliament and beginning with the</p>
<p>provincial governments using its sub national government to introduce some form of control.</p>
<p>I think over the past years Honourable Governor of National Capital District, Powes</p>
<p>Parkop, has pushed dealing with gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea. He has established</p>
<p>the NCDC gold standard strategy of addressing GBV, which is a first comprehensive strategy</p>
<p>developed in Papua New Guinea at the provincial level to address the issue of GBV.</p>
<p>The strategy takes its lead from the Goal 1 of the National Goals and Directive Principles</p>
<p>which establish the goal for every person to be dynamically involved in the process of freeing</p>
<p>himself or herself of every form of domination or oppression that each man or woman will have</p>
<p>the opportunity to develop as a whole person. I think Governor Parkop called a high level meeting</p>
<p>some two years ago which brought together members of parliament, governors, development</p>
<p>partners and others to devise a way forward.</p>
<p>21/04</p>
<p>The strategic way to introduce information on gender-based violence into education, the</p>
<p>work place, government, the Police, courts, the market place transportation and home environment.</p>
<p>Overall, the approach I think of Governor Pakop seems like a well-intentioned and well thought-</p>
<p>out out strategy for dealing with gender-based violence. It, Mr Acting Speaker, deserves support</p>
<p>of all the provinces. During the Governors’ week we were talking about how we can empower</p>
<p>provinces, so let us begin there.</p>
<p>Now standing here before you I want to give you a bird’s eye view that I have taken this</p>
<p>matter very seriously and a possible contribution approach of New Ireland. I also recommend that</p>
<p>New Ireland take its own initiative to prepare its strategy for combating gender based violence.</p>
<p>They should be tailored at specific social and cultural characteristics of New Ireland. It should</p>
<p>serve as New Ireland’s contribution to the proposed governors’ conference which is coming on</p>
<p>GBV. Our Chairman, the Governor of East Sepik and those matters suggested by Governor Powes</p>
<p>Parkop.</p>
<p>The drafting of such a strategy should be the responsibility of community development</p>
<p>which we all have and law and order sectors which we should have but we are not getting it and</p>
<p>the administration which is very disintegrated today. The overall approach of the strategy should</p>
<p>Page 30:</p>
<p>be based on the eight steps recommended by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities</p>
<p>which I am not going to talk about it which is a pretty long piece.</p>
<p>Why I spend time on this is because women are important. Mr Acting Speaker No matter</p>
<p>how you look at it, no one here today would be here if it was not for a woman, our mothers. I lost</p>
<p>mine about 48 years ago. I am old but I still miss her.</p>
<p>Women are quite simply the source of life. Women are the creators of humanity. Without</p>
<p>women there would be no people. Now I think that makes women pretty important to all of us.</p>
<p>I want to link that with youth somewhat because we are the sons of women. Well if women</p>
<p>are creators of life, then youths are the creators of the future. All of us, know, I think me more than</p>
<p>you all, are old (lapuns), we'll be gone. You will stay for a very long time. I will be going very</p>
<p>soon, oh there are some people out there who are praying for me to go earlier.</p>
<p>(Members laughter)</p>
<p>Sir JULIUS CHAN — Now I hope you won’t get too far. You will beat me to the end of</p>
<p>the line. Don’t get too eager to get rid of us. Still the truth is, the old folks you and me, you are not</p>
<p>as old as me, but I am just generalizing it, we will not be around for that much longer. Unless you</p>
<p>have the special road that we do not have. We are all going the same way.</p>
<p>22/04</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, who will be left. That’s why I linked the women and the youth. Those</p>
<p>who will be left will be the youth. And who will depend on the youth to make the world a better</p>
<p>place than it is today.</p>
<p>The youth, our young people. If the youth of the world today do not make the world a better</p>
<p>place tomorrow, then I say there is no hope for humanity. So, I have faith in the youth and I know</p>
<p>they can do it. So it is really a pleasure for me to say a few words on women and youth today. And</p>
<p>to emphasise that I am addressing the youth of New Ireland in Port Moresby and everywhere else</p>
<p>in this country. They must not get involved in this game. They must discipline themselves. New</p>
<p>Irelanders, you have to be very ashamed if you are part of this organisation that constantly denotes</p>
<p>the value of women. Women are the creators of life.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Governor, I am sorry to interrupt you, just</p>
<p>reminding you that your ten minutes of debate has lapsed. Ill allow you to sum up your debate.</p>
<p>Page 31:</p>
<p>Sir JULIUS CHAN -— Thank you very much, Mr Acting Speaker, you are the only one</p>
<p>that can do that.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER -— Governor, with respect for you, I gave you the extra three</p>
<p>minutes.</p>
<p>Sir JULIUS CHAN — I want to repeat myself and I can see some of you are bored. I said</p>
<p>women are the creators of life and that is true but even when women create life but for some reason</p>
<p>we do not seem to appreciate that women do. Why is it that men of the world and men of New</p>
<p>Ireland abuse women? Why is it that United Nations say that Papua New Guinea has one of the</p>
<p>highest rates of gender-based violence of any country in the world?</p>
<p>Let us not lie to ourselves using sugar coated verbiage, if we cannot look after ourselves,</p>
<p>our human beings, our women who brought us into this world, then all we have said is just rubbish.</p>
<p>Violence in any country in the world as I have said, why is it that high percentage of women</p>
<p>in Papua New Guinea report that they have been raped then in almost any other country and the</p>
<p>world? This is just the truth. We should be ashamed. We should not camouflage it. We should not</p>
<p>hide it or pretend to say all these good things about the resource-rich country floating on a sea of</p>
<p>oil. These are all just lies if you cannot look after your mother, the women of this country!</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we are among the worst offenders in the world and that to me and I</p>
<p>am sure you share my feeling, is something we really cannot be proud of.</p>
<p>I am not speaking as though New Ireland is not part of this, in fact that is why I began by</p>
<p>focusing on Now Ireland.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, it is disgusting, and it must stop. Every time someone gets mad at</p>
<p>someone else, they decide that person is a witch and they start tormenting and even torturing them.</p>
<p>23/04</p>
<p>Well I can tell all the women and honourable members here today that we must stop this.</p>
<p>You and I don’t stop this then they can do a lot of demonstration but they cannot.</p>
<p>But, I want to promise you, Mr Acting Speaker, I take this matter very seriously. My</p>
<p>government is going to work on a policy on Violence Against Women. We are going to set up</p>
<p>hotlines for women to call if they are abused, and we are going to set up safe houses for women to</p>
<p>live in so that they can get away from those who are abusing them and we are going to punish the</p>
<p>abusers. I say to all men of New Ireland today, wherever you are, if you abuse a woman you are</p>
<p>going to jail, full stop. Why? Because you show your wives, daughters, and mothers no pity so if</p>
<p>Page 32:</p>
<p>you show your woman no pity then we will also show you no pity. The right house for you is in</p>
<p>jail.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Governor, I am sorry I will have to interrupt you</p>
<p>again, your other three minutes has lapsed.</p>
<p>Sir JULIAS CHAN -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Impact of Global Economy</p>
<p>Mr ALLAN BIRD (East Sepik) — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. And may I say to the</p>
<p>House that it is always a privilege for Sir Julius to speak and I will always be happy to give up my</p>
<p>space for him, in recognition of the fact that he is the last man standing. He spoke on an issue that</p>
<p>is very close to my heart and I would like to endorse those comments.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, my grievance is in relation to the economy today, particularly in what</p>
<p>is happening in the US, in some of their medium size banks. We noted last week the closing of</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bay, which funds organizations like Facebook and a lot of these Tech Companies</p>
<p>and it has gone bust lately, Credit Swiss in Europe, which is one of their biggest banks is also in</p>
<p>trouble and there are many other banks that are indicating that they could be in trouble in the</p>
<p>coming months.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the world could be facing another financial meltdown compared to</p>
<p>1997 and this is being brought about by the prolonged pandemic that the entire world faced in</p>
<p>Covid-19 which forced a lot of governments to borrow, including our government. The Central</p>
<p>Banks around the world began to tighten interest rates in order to control inflation. I have noticed</p>
<p>in Papua New Guinea in the last few months that there has been a lot of concern by the country on</p>
<p>the issue of inflation. Many Papua New Guineans don’t understand why we are facing this and we</p>
<p>somehow feel that what is happening in the other parts of the world should not affect us.</p>
<p>But, I want to say here in the House that whilst we are concerned with DSIP, fixing things</p>
<p>in our district and provinces we should have a mechanism that recognizes what is happening in</p>
<p>other parts of the world that affect us. Many of us still deny that Covid-19 was real and we forgot</p>
<p>that China is only now reducing its tight control on Covid-19, it has only done so in the last couple</p>
<p>of months. China is the largest country on earth and it continues to take Covid-19 very seriously.</p>
<p>Also in Papua New Guinea, I noticed that the Central Bank has not tightened interest rates</p>
<p>compared to other Central Banks and so the impact of our banks by the Central Bank perhaps is</p>
<p>not as significant as we see in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Page 33:</p>
<p>Now, just to give everyone the size of the problem, Credit Swiss will be requiring more</p>
<p>than $50 billion in cash injection from the Central Bank in its country to keep operating and that</p>
<p>is how significant it is. So if other banks follow suit then a lot of our banks could be in trouble</p>
<p>because we are borrowing from the world.</p>
<p>24/04</p>
<p>That is how significant it is and if other banks follow suit a lot of our programs could also</p>
<p>be in trouble because we are borrowing from the world and we have significant debt. I am worried</p>
<p>about the knock-on effects. And just to give the House a further understanding of what is</p>
<p>happening as a result of Covid-19 and as a result of the Ukraine/Russian war, fertilizer prices have</p>
<p>increased 110 per cent across the world,</p>
<p>The two crops that rely heavily on fertilizer are rice and wheat. You will notice that this</p>
<p>year the price of rice and wheat globally has increased by 20 per cent. Last year some wheat</p>
<p>producers increased prices by up to 160 per cent. I don’t believe that we should continue to bury</p>
<p>our head in the sand and pretend that what is happening in the globally economy will not affect us.</p>
<p>My view is that we should be doing more locally and increasing local production so that we can</p>
<p>off-set some of these things that are happening globally.</p>
<p>Our people in the towns and cities will feel this impact and that is why I have been asking</p>
<p>a lot of questions about power as the cost of power feeds into the general cost that everybody needs</p>
<p>to pay. And as we wait for interventions to happen, this is where I personally do not want to</p>
<p>continue to blame the former PNC government. I think that is an old story and we should not</p>
<p>continue to do that. Whatever has happened has happened, let us put it behind us. We should be</p>
<p>really taking ownership of the issues now.</p>
<p>On the issue on jobs and again it is important for the economy, we just do not have the jobs</p>
<p>and we know that and I recall when I was sitting in the Opposition in this House; the then</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Patrick Pruaitch made a presentation here where the numbers that he got from</p>
<p>the Central Bank showed a decline of 100 thousand jobs. This happened during the time of PNC</p>
<p>in government. Fast forward to today, we still don’t know what we are doing in terms of jobs. We</p>
<p>have all these really nice programs and every district has district programs happening but we do</p>
<p>not know how it is feeding into the economy.</p>
<p>We have no idea because our statistics is not working and all the time we are making</p>
<p>guesses and throwing mud at each other but the underlying problem still remains. We have more</p>
<p>than 70 thousand young people finishing school every year, are we creating 70 thousand jobs every</p>
<p>Page 34:</p>
<p>year? The answer is no and if you look at the presentation by the Treasurer out of the K24 billion</p>
<p>Budget, only K900 million is being targeted at the economy.</p>
<p>I do not want to complain about that because that is how we have always treated the</p>
<p>economy and if you look at every single Budget, the economy gets a very small proportion of the</p>
<p>National Budget in terms of everything we want to pay for. Education and health get over 40 per</p>
<p>cent of the Budget. And if you look at all of our administration costs for salaries it leaves very little</p>
<p>for the economy. And without the economy we are going to sit back and worry how we are going</p>
<p>to keep the rice and wheat prices low and if people have not already figured it out, palm oil prices</p>
<p>are going up so the cooking oil prices in the shops are going to go up as well. In essence the entire</p>
<p>basket of basic goods that our people want to use, particularly those in towns and cities will</p>
<p>increase in price.</p>
<p>And we need some kind of intervention, perhaps from Parliament. I am not sure if we have</p>
<p>an economic committee, it’s perhaps time to activate it. We need to be talking to our industries</p>
<p>and those that are supplying power and bring in the entire core structure of doing business down.</p>
<p>We have got to make our economy more competitive so it grows. Whilst we are intervening in the</p>
<p>SME space with concessional funding, it is actually like a drop in the ocean; it is not making a</p>
<p>difference.</p>
<p>25/04</p>
<p>It might make a difference to one or two families, but not to the wider community.</p>
<p>My grievance debate is that; I would like to see someone take ownership of it. I know the</p>
<p>Treasurer ‘cops a lot of flak’ for it, but what people do not realise is that the Treasurer only brings</p>
<p>in the money, he does not spend the money. The spending occurs in other agencies.</p>
<p>As a member of this Government, I would like to see some of the portfolio ministers, in</p>
<p>terms of the money you are getting from Treasury and are using in your departments, how are you</p>
<p>contributing to alleviating some of this problems. We need to know and be debating those issues.</p>
<p>It is rather unfair that we target the Treasurer all the time, when his job is only to bring money into</p>
<p>the country, whilst other people spend it.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is the knock-on effects from the banks. If banks in Europe, America and</p>
<p>Asia starts to collapse, we will be in trouble. We will sit here and pretend to be busy with our DSIP</p>
<p>and PSIP to build roads and classrooms, and we will be affected.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, this is my grievance debate for this afternoon. Thank you.</p>
<p>Page 35:</p>
<p>State of the Economy</p>
<p>Mr KEITH IDUHU (Hiri-Koiari) — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for this opportunity</p>
<p>to address the House also on similar sentiments as shared by the Governor of East Sepik Province.</p>
<p>The issues I would like to address is on the culmination of facts on the state of affairs</p>
<p>affecting the globe and our municipal economy, which culminated into an exchange the other day</p>
<p>between the Treasurer and the former Prime Minister, the Member for Ialibu-Pangia.</p>
<p>I address this issue as a first-time member on the Floor of Parliament. There are 41 of us</p>
<p>in this House, most of who have been prompted by the events of yesteryears and complaints of</p>
<p>yesteryears to come into this House and make a particular difference.</p>
<p>As a Papua New Guinean, I feel as if we have a very short memory. In the PNC-led regime,</p>
<p>everybody wanted to throw stones, even some of us are in this House today. Again in this regime,</p>
<p>the same very people are so quick to throw stones at the current regime and its affairs and how we</p>
<p>are running this country.</p>
<p>Our good Treasurer is only one man, so as our Honourable Prime Minister James Marape</p>
<p>and also our former Prime Minister, the Member for Ialibu-Pangia, Mr Peter O’ Neill. We seem to</p>
<p>be very quick to judge but not very quick to offer solutions.</p>
<p>The writings are on the wall. The government cannot fix everything for the population at</p>
<p>any one time, at the drop of a hat. But the efforts that every successive government makes, are</p>
<p>worth taking note of and worth taking the heart to work for this country. It is now 48 years and we</p>
<p>seem to be continuously doing the same thing, yet expecting a very different result.</p>
<p>As a former late President of the United States once said; “let’s not ask what of the country,</p>
<p>but what you can do for your country”. Ask not of what the country can do for you, but what you</p>
<p>and I can do for our country. They also said; “Rome was not built in one day.”</p>
<p>26/04</p>
<p>The economy of course needs our help. I think we can all agree to that. But I think where</p>
<p>we are missing the point when we discuss our economic hardships is that 47 years has transpired,</p>
<p>we made constitutional changes, legislative reforms, bureaucratic changes at the Cabinet levels of</p>
<p>successive governments and yet no matter how many changes we make, how many resources deals</p>
<p>we sign off, how many big projects we can sign off, we still find ourselves in a very strong</p>
<p>disadvantaged position.</p>
<p>When I say we, I am talking about the eight million people of this country, 80 per cent of</p>
<p>whom are all in the rural sector. We can’t continue to do this blame game because the point is,</p>
<p>people are moving from the rural villages into the fringes of every city. Port Moresby is a classic</p>
<p>Page 36:</p>
<p>example. Lae is a clear classic example. Mt Hagen is another example. Every urban centre has its</p>
<p>fringes of communities building and brewing up.</p>
<p>We are all running for the same pie and yet every time we talk about building the rural</p>
<p>economy, well how are we going to build the rural economy if we are not availing credit to the</p>
<p>rural economy? And how can we avail credit to the rural economy if we are not availing securities</p>
<p>to our rural economy? And how can we avail security to our rural economy if we cannot formalise</p>
<p>their assets in the rural economy? This is why people are shifting to six-mile, shifting to Hiri-</p>
<p>Koiari, shifting to the fringes of Lae because everybody wants the same thing, poor or rich.</p>
<p>We all want a shelter over our heads, we also want clothing, we all want a meal on the table</p>
<p>and all of these things require access to financing. Without financing, we cannot feed our families,</p>
<p>our people are going to continue to struggle and the complaints are going to continue to culminate</p>
<p>and every 18 months, you will want to change the government and yet we complain about the lack</p>
<p>of stability.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity. We have just passed the K24 billion Budget. A budget that will</p>
<p>probably increase the next financial year and will keep increasing against the very little security</p>
<p>that is only available to this country. Our faults, and I resound and I adopt entirely the sentiments</p>
<p>shared by the Governor of East Sepik Province. We need a very close look at the structure of</p>
<p>Government and I say this with great care. I say we need to look at the legal framework. We keep</p>
<p>trying to play rugby league on a golf course. We keep trying to put a square pole though a round</p>
<p>hole. This is why we keep finding ourselves at the drawing board.</p>
<p>We keep trying to do reforms at the high level but for you to understand, every economy</p>
<p>on this planet earth and the globe, works off security. The security is land. We have 80 per cent of</p>
<p>land in the rural sector, when are we going to include our rural populace if we do not legislate or</p>
<p>formalise that legal economy? If we do not have proper identification for our legal populace so</p>
<p>that they are not creating extra-legal activities so that they can survive. But imagine if we are to</p>
<p>formalise their local economy, their access to credit, then we will be doing a great justice to our</p>
<p>people and for our people.</p>
<p>I also adopt and endorse the sentiments shared by the Governor of East Sepik Province that</p>
<p>really requires a need for the playing field on which our budget will be run. When we are running</p>
<p>the economy, we must avail the necessary security for every Papua New Guinean to access credit.</p>
<p>There is no point in putting K1 billion into NDB so as to avail it to the rural sector if the rural</p>
<p>sector is not going to be able to avail the security fundamental banking principles, to access that</p>
<p>credit. There is no point!</p>
<p>Page 37:</p>
<p>On the statement made by the Prime Minister on our country standing on milky land</p>
<p>because it has oil, gas and our country is considered as Black Christian Nation.</p>
<p>When PNG first gained Independence in 1975, there was one thing that stood firm and</p>
<p>gave courage and strength to our country to gain independence and it’s the foundation for this</p>
<p>country. I want to thank the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia, for realizing</p>
<p>the importance during that time. I also thank the former Speaker, for realizing the importance. It’s</p>
<p>very important and it’s to save our country in giving us strength to stand firm.</p>
<p>Everything stands firmly on stone and it’s the foundation of a country. All of us in here</p>
<p>one way or another are considered as Christians. When we first got elected the pastors prayed for</p>
<p>us and dedicated us all to the Lord for his wisdom, knowledge and understanding upon our daily</p>
<p>lives to lead the country.</p>
<p>But one thing that I want to touch on is about the Bible in front us in this House. This Bible</p>
<p>doesn’t have protection or guidance over it.</p>
<p>27/04</p>
<p>Unless we take some structural adjustment on the legal framework of credit in the context</p>
<p>of formalizing customary land tenure in this country, we will be wasting our time in repeating</p>
<p>ourselves like a turning time clock. And sooner or later if the global economy crashes we are going</p>
<p>to be dragged with it because we failed to understand our own prudence and social unit of clans.</p>
<p>For thousands of years Papua New Guineans always hunted and gathered together as clans.</p>
<p>Why do we keep kidding ourselves? There is absolutely necessary need that this kind of reform</p>
<p>and thinking must be adopted. I encourage and urge all critics because the same critics will be</p>
<p>continuing the same narrative even twenty months down the line.</p>
<p>I thank the Government, we all must work together and I thank our Prime Minister for his</p>
<p>tireless efforts and sleepless night in the kind of work he does for the country and the former Prime</p>
<p>Minister and the former Ministers for the contributions in their respective duties in serving the</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>With these few remarks the Lord will bless you all, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Enact Legislation to Protect Bible</p>
<p>Mr KANSOL HARWAI KAMDARU (Middle Ramu) — Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>My grievance debate will be brief. But firstly, I thank the Lord for allowing us this time to live.</p>
<p>Page 38:</p>
<p>Secondly, I thank our Honorable Prime Minister of this country, the Deputy Prime</p>
<p>Minister, the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia, I thank and congratulate him</p>
<p>for his contribution.</p>
<p>I also thank the Lord for his mercy and love upon Sir Julius Chan, Governor of New</p>
<p>Ireland, which some of the senior leaders have left us but he is still around and with us today.</p>
<p>My debate is brief but very important concerning the lives of our people of Papua New</p>
<p>Guinea. I want to elaborate further on the statement made by the Prime Minister on our country</p>
<p>standing on milky land because it has oil, gas and our country is considered as Black Christian</p>
<p>Nation.</p>
<p>When PNG first gained Independence in 1975, there was one thing that stood firm and</p>
<p>gave courage and strength to our country to gain independence and it’s the foundation for this</p>
<p>country. I want to thank the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia, for realizing</p>
<p>the importance during that time. I also thank the former Speaker, for realizing the importance. It’s</p>
<p>very important and it’s to save our country in giving us strength to stand firm.</p>
<p>Everything stands firmly on stone and it’s the foundation of a country. All of us in here</p>
<p>one way or another are considered as Christians. When we first got elected the pastors prayed for</p>
<p>us and dedicated us all to the Lord for his wisdom, knowledge and understanding upon our daily</p>
<p>lives to lead the country.</p>
<p>But one thing that I want to touch on is about the Bible in front us in this House. This Bible</p>
<p>doesn’t have protection or guidance over it.</p>
<p>28/04</p>
<p>We have to make it a law in this country because this Bible is here to stay. The law must</p>
<p>guide and protect it in this House. We do not know who the next Government will be; a different</p>
<p>man with different ideas and new thoughts will come. They can be able to move the Bible out. My</p>
<p>concern is that we must include the Bible in our Constitution. The Prime Minister once stated that</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea is a black Christian nation. Those words must go down in the Constitution for</p>
<p>the country, it must act as a stepping stone for us leaders and it will be supporting us and helping</p>
<p>to develop this country and bring it forward. This is very important for this country. The majority</p>
<p>of people in this country are Christians. Sometimes we encounter situations that are beyond our</p>
<p>control and we entrust our prayers to maintain this country. When we have the Bible in the House</p>
<p>we as leaders can be able to steer the people and the country in the right direction.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
