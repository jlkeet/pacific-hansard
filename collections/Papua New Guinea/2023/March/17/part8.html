<p>Third Reading</p>
<p>Leave granted to move the Third Reading forthwith.</p>
<p>Motion (by Mr Joe Sungi) proposed —</p>
<p>That the Bill be now read a third time.</p>
<p>Mr DON POLYE (Kandep — Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and</p>
<p>Technology and Sports) — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I support the Minister for Public Service</p>
<p>in the amendment of the PILAG that is brought forthwith in observing some of the functions of</p>
<p>that institution, and also for changing the name from PILAG to CILAG.</p>
<p>I welcome the articulated comments made by the Member for Pomio on this issue, and I</p>
<p>would like to also talk about some of them. The Public Service Minister has established very</p>
<p>clearly and competently the governance and leadership of the institution.</p>
<p>The governance and leadership of an institution, not only for the PILAG, but also in the</p>
<p>other institution, in my observation, has become a very challenging and demanding issue for Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea. I have observed in other higher learning institutions like; universities and technical</p>
<p>colleges, institutes, teacher’s colleges, nursing colleges, et cetera.</p>
<p>The same can be observed in SOE’s and departments and so forth in standard organisations,</p>
<p>that the governance and leadership has been one area of wanting in the country that must be</p>
<p>addressed properly, because the overall operations of the entity or this institution relies on the</p>
<p>leadership provided by the board or the governing council of any entity.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I have observed that when the people on the board become</p>
<p>compromised, it affects the performance and the structure of implementation of the body.</p>
<p>06/04</p>
<p>It is very important because many times we complain and we find grievances raised by the</p>
<p>public about lack of performance, people not meeting their key targets and the objectives of the</p>
<p>organization. You will find the quality declining and I found that it is quite common to the Higher</p>
<p>Education sector that I am entrusted with by the good Prime Minister to look after. I find leadership</p>
<p>and governance as a very important issue.</p>
<p>The two areas that I see that affects or compromises the leadership and governance are;</p>
<p>firstly, politicization. Let me take myself as a case to illustrate the point. If I want a friend or</p>
<p>wantok of mine to become the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor of the University of Papua New</p>
<p>Page 10:</p>
<p>Guinea and to other positions down the line, Mr Acting Speaker, if I am wrong or if I am short</p>
<p>sighted what I would do is use the powers given under the Higher Education Provisions Act to</p>
<p>push the appointment of my friends. That has really affected all of the public service machinery,</p>
<p>especially the very important institutions like PILAG or SILAG that we are now referring to.</p>
<p>I would like to urge all of us that we must understand the appointments of those key people</p>
<p>at the governance and leadership level. The board level is very key because they are the people</p>
<p>who will determine the operations and quality output and implementation of government policy. I</p>
<p>am very happy that the Public Service Minister has very confidently articulated on this amendment</p>
<p>that is brought before this House that we will address and entrust confident people up there. I also</p>
<p>know that it is the policy of the Marape-Rosso government to making sure people appointed are</p>
<p>people with credibility and not only with political experience, but ones that will be making sure</p>
<p>that the institutions and or state bodies are properly governed under the rule of law and manage</p>
<p>money, operational matters and achieve quality.</p>
<p>The second area is quality of the academic programs. This is about the quality of the</p>
<p>programs and academic programs offered by the institutions. In this case like, PILAG or SILAG,</p>
<p>I heard the Member for Pomio talk about quality academic programs which Minister for Public</p>
<p>Service also mentioned.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, what we are doing at the Higher Education space is, we will not register</p>
<p>any institution, colleges or universities that do not meet the standard of registration. I am driving</p>
<p>that quite vehemently. This standard must be the standard that meet benchmarks against some of</p>
<p>the best business practices and academic practices in the world. When Papua New Guinea’s</p>
<p>standard is high at that level, and programs at that level being disseminated or imparted to those</p>
<p>tutors coming in or trainees in the leadership sector or governance sector, you will find that they</p>
<p>are at par with the international level. That means they can now manage their area of</p>
<p>responsibilities, not with Papua New Guinean standards or cultural way, but with best businesses,</p>
<p>companies and institutions practice of the world. They will have to meet the standard registration</p>
<p>requirement under the Marape-Rosso government.</p>
<p>The other area we also looked at is the programs that the Minister for Public Service</p>
<p>referred to that are being taught in the institutions. They must be properly accredited. Accreditation</p>
<p>standard of international standards must be met. Mr Acting Speaker, the standard is very important</p>
<p>because when you have somebody passing out of the colleges or the institute like the SILAG</p>
<p>institute for instance, you will be confident that they can administer as a secretary of a department</p>
<p>or as a MD of an SOE or a Vice Chancellor or Chancellor of an Institution in Papua New Guinea,</p>
<p>and deliver quality output.</p>
<p>Page 11:</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, one of the things I observed is —and let me give a medical calamity as</p>
<p>an example without putting anybody off.</p>
<p>07/04</p>
<p>If somebody is a good doctor in hospital, the mindset and the impression is he would be</p>
<p>the best manager of that hospital. The best specialist in one particular area cannot be the best</p>
<p>manager of a broader scale of management or governance.</p>
<p>The Pacific Institute of Leadership and Governance (PILAG) is available for those who</p>
<p>want to become CEOs of hospitals and Vice Chancellors of universities to go through this institute</p>
<p>to qualify for that accredited and well registered courses taught at PILAG or SILAG. And not just</p>
<p>appointing anybody because he or she has a PHD in Chemistry and we blindly offer him or her the</p>
<p>position thinking that they will be a good Vice Chancellor.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, my observation is that it cannot work because he or she is not</p>
<p>specialized in that area. I am not discrediting them but so proud of Papua New Guineans who are</p>
<p>experts in those areas. But management, administration, governance, rule of law and following</p>
<p>process and procedures of governance in public service in PNG is different.</p>
<p>Therefore, the now called, Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance (SILA), will be</p>
<p>the right place to go to. Those who want to become managers, CEOs, MDs, Secretaries or Vice</p>
<p>Chancellors must go to SILAG to qualify in leadership training process. And they can deploy some</p>
<p>of this leadership techniques in all these institutes, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Finally, the change from PILAG to SILAG named after the Grand Chief, Sir Michael</p>
<p>Thomas Somare, I think is a good idea. The Governor of East Sepik proposed and the Prime</p>
<p>Minister also alluded that we should have a university called the Somare University in East Sepik</p>
<p>to be established. But firstly, to honour the Grand Chief as the first Prime Minister, this institution</p>
<p>was established in 1963, around the same time when the Grand Chief became a politician and</p>
<p>eventually became the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s fitting that we call it SILAG to honor Somare. And even other leaders like</p>
<p>Sir Julius Chan, one of the pioneers who is still here with us and other good leaders who have gone</p>
<p>before us to honor them is to give governance and quality leadership. We must ensure such</p>
<p>programs are properly accredited to international standards and leadership provided in those areas</p>
<p>are wanting to our country. In doing so will improve quality and at the same time honor somebody</p>
<p>like him.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
