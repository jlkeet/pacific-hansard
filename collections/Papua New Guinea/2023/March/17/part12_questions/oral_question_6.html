<p>(5) Which department do we work with, is it through the Minister for Foreign Affairs or</p>
<p>Trade and Investment to fast track this border post development?</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the Member for North</p>
<p>Fly for his important questions as his electorate is located right at the border with Indonesia and</p>
<p>West Papua. There is need for us to step up our border interventions.</p>
<p>Last December, I was privileged to spend a night at Bench back but before | arrived there,</p>
<p>I visited Weihom, its 15 kilometers from the national border and it was rather sad to see that this</p>
<p>military border post was completely deteriorated and not functioning.</p>
<p>When I came back from that visit, | committed to step up our interventions and support at</p>
<p>the border areas.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I also want to thank all the members of Parliament for their support in</p>
<p>signing this ratification in our border treaty with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This gives us</p>
<p>the basis for us to go into new treaty arrangements. We will be consulting our landowners along</p>
<p>the borders especially on our side, the LLGs, council wards, the districts and border provinces in</p>
<p>making sure whatever we need to do in the border areas must step up and must have an agency</p>
<p>Page 25:</p>
<p>responsible for border going forward and with that I want to assure the House and all the border</p>
<p>districts and provinces.</p>
<p>The function at the moment has been called back and it’s under the Department of Foreign</p>
<p>Affairs in terms of the border. Mr Acting Speaker, we are looking at the border areas from a trade</p>
<p>and commerce perspective. It should be classified as a special economic zone along the border</p>
<p>areas.</p>
<p>On the other side of the border we have 270 million Indonesians. It is a robust place in terms</p>
<p>of market for our producers and we are looking in that context so the Department of Commerce</p>
<p>and Industry as well as the Ministries of International Trade and Foreign Affairs will work in</p>
<p>partnership with Defense to look into how best we could structure our border area that is geared</p>
<p>towards caring our country’s need going forward into the future because Indonesia has been our</p>
<p>trading partner for so long. We have downplayed those aspects of our relationship and just seeing</p>
<p>them from a political perspective for a long time.</p>
<p>I want to assure the Member and Vice Minister, his district and province as well as Sandaun</p>
<p>Province and districts have been engaging in our own government in the last two to three years.</p>
<p>We have started a program with the border outpost, Defence Force and the Ministry have taken</p>
<p>care of this matter in a holistic approach by integrating Foreign Affairs, Defense, International</p>
<p>Trade and Commerce and Industry to have a multi-sectoral approach in the border post.</p>
<p>We can have trade functions at Vanimo/Wutung facing Jayapura and Daru/Weihom facing</p>
<p>Meraque on the other side as well as the middle areas. There is deep conversation going on with</p>
<p>Indonesian authorities and during my visit to Indonesia we have engaged for trade and commerce</p>
<p>to be activated for us to have a border use and sharing arrangements.</p>
<p>18/04</p>
<p>Not just at the traditional crossing level but more or less at the commercial and government</p>
<p>to government crossing in the border areas.</p>
<p>We will call the leaders from the provinces concern to sit together as we worked on new</p>
<p>Treaty with Indonesia for the borders. In that occasion we will pull together our focus on trade and</p>
<p>commerce and get that place open up instead of allowing it to remain a blackspot in our country.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
