<p>(1) What is the National Government focus and plan towards the border facilities?</p>
<p>(2) How are we going to progress on the development specifically in terms of</p>
<p>infrastructure and the funding arrangement and all of it?</p>
<p>Now take the case of Wutung; we have realized that these posts were previously developed</p>
<p>by successive governments under a funding arrangement from NDB, I think more than K200 or</p>
<p>K300 million plus. You will see that the infrastructures are substandard. When I say this, I mean</p>
<p>there is no power and no water running, and no customer service and even no office space for staff.</p>
<p>On top of all these, there are no trading facilities. It looks like we are going nowhere, and what</p>
<p>concerns me is how do we, Western Province, make sure we donâ€™t repeat that same mistake and</p>
<p>progress on?</p>
<p>(3) So what are the funding or resource arrangements for the next lot of infrastructure for</p>
<p>other proposed border post?</p>
