<h3>(1) Cam the Minister confirm whether NPC has awarded contracts to?</h3>
<p>(1) Cam the Minister confirm whether NPC has awarded contracts to?</p>
<p>(2) Can the Minister confirm or deny whether K41 millions of Simbu Polytech funds has</p>
<p>been expended?</p>
<p>(3) If yes, where has the K41 million gone? (4) If no, when will Polytech construction</p>
<p>start in my electorate and what is the reason for the delay?</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr DON POLYE - Mr Acting Speaker, these are very sensitive questions with regards to</p>
<p>Polytech in Simbu province and in Gumine district. Yes, I agree with the NEC decision that is in</p>
<p>place and it is NEC Decision 105. I have seen that and I’ve also got some report. But because he</p>
<p>Page 15:</p>
<p>is asking very specific questions as to the contractor and how much money has been paid, if there</p>
<p>has been any work done, I don’t want to give an answer off the top of my head</p>
<p>10/04</p>
<p>I will give detailed answers because it is very important but that Polytech School will be</p>
<p>built and will be built properly in due process with quality. I will articulate more on that so I will</p>
<p>ask him to be patient until next week when I will answer the questions in detail. Thank you.</p>
<p>Rural Service Development Program</p>
<p>Mr FRANCIS SIUNE — Thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to speak</p>
<p>in this House. Mr. Speaker, my question without notice is directed to Minister for Provincial and</p>
<p>Local Level Government Affairs. I think I have asked this question in our previous session but I</p>
<p>want to repeat because I haven’t seen feedback.</p>
<p>There was a program called Rural Service Development Project or RSDP implemented by</p>
<p>the Government of Papua New Guinea through the Local Government and Provincial Affairs. The</p>
<p>program was financed by World Bank and the Australian Government in excess of K23 million.</p>
<p>It’s supposed to be piloted in 20 LLGs in 19 districts, namely; East New Britain, Central, Chimbu,</p>
<p>Western Province and Western Highlands.</p>
<p>The program commenced in 2013. This program was vital because it complemented our</p>
<p>DSIP and PSI programs in service delivery and could give rise to bottom-up concept. Mobilisation</p>
<p>component was done in Simbu. The coordination office was established and launched. Beneficial</p>
<p>LLGs have put in their mobilisation funding.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, since today, nothing has been implemented. My question is, can our</p>
<p>good Minister explain what happened to this very important program for the good of everybody?</p>
<p>And if there’s a stop somewhere, Mr. Speaker can we have this very important program activated</p>
<p>and implemented?</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr SOROI EOE — Thank you Mr. Acting Speaker and I thank the Honourable Member</p>
<p>for Kerowagi for the very important question.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I raised an issue with the Clerk’s office if I could seek leave of the Parliament</p>
<p>to respond to that question but that has not been granted but thank you for asking the question</p>
<p>again so I can fully respond to the issues that you have raised on the 11" of January, the first sitting</p>
<p>of the Parliament.</p>
<p>Page 16:</p>
<p>So let me thank you. I would’ve responded immediately had I not fell ill that whole week.</p>
<p>I was not in the Parliament and, therefore, I couldn’t respond to you and answer those important</p>
<p>issues that you have raised. Nonetheless with the concurrence of the Chair, if I could now respond</p>
<p>in detail to the questions that have been raised.</p>
<p>Mr. ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Minister, the Chair recognizes that we have many</p>
<p>members of the House willing to ask questions within the time frame we have and whether question</p>
<p>time will give you enough time to explain. I will ask you to seek leave of the Chair after the</p>
<p>question time and we can allow you to respond.</p>
<p>Mr. SOROI EOE - If that is okay with the Member for Kerowagi, I thank you Chair.</p>
<p>11/04</p>
<p>Disposal of Nuclear Waste</p>
<p>Mr MUGUWA DILU - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for recognising me. My question</p>
<p>is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>On the 13" of January this year, BBC news reported that the nuclear power plant in Japan</p>
<p>was going to dispose one million tonnes of nuclear waste into the Pacific Ocean. Now, I must</p>
<p>congratulate the Fisheries Minister, he wrote to the Pacific Islands Forum to garner regional</p>
<p>support so that they can take a regional position on this issue.</p>
<p>Now that’s a violation of the International Convention of 1972 — the London Convention</p>
<p>for international actors not to dispose nuclear waste into the Ocean. The Pacific Ocean especially</p>
<p>the Western Pacific Ocean is host to about one-third of the world’s tuna stock and we are host to</p>
<p>also marine biodiversity that has a lot of value when it comes to blue ocean and blue carbon trade.</p>
<p>We also know that the fisheries industry in this country contributes more than K1 billion into the</p>
<p>government coffers so that we can implement our national budget.</p>
<p>Is the Foreign Affairs Minister progressing any bilateral talks with authorities in Japan so</p>
<p>that they can stop the irresponsible behaviour that they propose to undertake?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Mr JUSTIN TKATCHENKO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker and I thank the Member</p>
<p>for this very important question. Last year in APEC, I had a personal meeting with the Foreign</p>
<p>Affairs Minister of Japan and I raised this question to him on behalf of the Pacific Island leaders</p>
<p>as well as our country as well to find out what the situation is with the nuclear or radioactive water</p>
<p>Page 17:</p>
<p>that they plan to release into the Pacific Ocean. He guaranteed that the radioactive water was</p>
<p>perfectly treated and could be drunk as normal drinking water and said that he will ensure that</p>
<p>there is no radioactivity in this water at all. Now that was from that meeting then, Our Prime</p>
<p>Minister also had a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan and also received a letter from the</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister stating the same but has delayed the releasing of this radioactive water</p>
<p>into the Pacific until further notice. So the situation is that if they do release this so-called ‘free-</p>
<p>of-radioactive water’ into the Pacific, firstly it will affect the people of Japan then it will spread</p>
<p>throughout the Pacific.</p>
<p>Now the Prime Minister of Japan guarantees the last thing he wants to do is contaminate</p>
<p>his own people. So after that, I represented the Prime Minister and Papua New Guinea and</p>
<p>presented the letter to the Pacific Islands Forum Retreat which was chaired by the outgoing</p>
<p>Chairman — the new Fijian Prime Minister, Honourable Rambuka. We brought up this subject</p>
<p>matter and it was agreed that more consultation had to be done. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders</p>
<p>have of course had experience in this nuclear radio activity, radioactivity especially in Micronesia</p>
<p>and those other countries.</p>
<p>As of to date, from the agreement from the Pacific Island Forum leaders, we will continue</p>
<p>to fight to not allow this nuclear or radioactivity contaminated water to be released and look at</p>
<p>other alternatives that would be better off for the benefit of everyone for the long term.</p>
<p>12/04</p>
<p>Yes, Member, we have been in consultation at the highest level with the Japanese</p>
<p>authorities, our Pacific leaders but also with world leaders when we had the ministerial forum as</p>
<p>well with Australia on this issue of radioactivity water being released.</p>
<p>At this point of time it is on hold for until further negotiations and we hope for common</p>
<p>sense to prevail that an alternative is found out for the benefit of not releasing this radioactive</p>
<p>water into the Pacific so it contaminates our fisheries and affects out people greatly. Thank you,</p>
<p>Mr Speaker.</p>
<p>Don Matheson and PNG Ports Corruption Scandal</p>
<p>Mr JOESPH LELANG -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to</p>
<p>the Prime Minister. Mr Acting Speaker, recently the Australian Broadcasting Commission or ABC</p>
<p>has reported an alleged corruption ring that involves influencing the awarding of contracts in PNG</p>
<p>major ports.</p>
<p>Page 18:</p>
<p>The financing of this major ports is funded from the Australian Infrastructure of Financing</p>
<p>Facility to the tune of US$434 million or an equivalent of AUS$621 million. It has been alleged</p>
<p>in that report that this ring involves a Philippine-based company called International Container</p>
<p>Terminal Services that paid an alleged AUS$4.35 million into an Australian citizen’s account</p>
<p>earlier in Singapore. This money was used by this Australian citizen, a Mr Don Matheson, to bribe</p>
<p>PNG Ports Officials so they can award lucrative contracts to this Filipino company to operate</p>
<p>PNG’s biggest ports to be funded out of this Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, we are facing another negative backlash on our country’s image and it is very</p>
<p>disturbing when it is an Australian citizen who is the ring leader and mastermind in this allegedly</p>
<p>corrupting the Australian taxpayers own money.</p>
<p>It is also disturbing that this gentleman has even boasted alleging that he has close ties to</p>
<p>our Prime Minister and plays golf with him including assisting with medical bills of a family</p>
<p>member in Philippines.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, these are serious allegations and it is important that these questions are</p>
<p>asked so that the Prime Minister can clear the air on this matter.</p>
<p>(1) Is the Prime Minister aware of this ABC report and the central role of Don Matheson</p>
<p>in this scandal?</p>
<p>(2) Can the Prime Minister confirm or deny that he has asked Don Matheson to pay</p>
<p>medical bills of a close relative in the Philippines?</p>
<p>(3) Can the Prime Minister inform Parliament on the steps his Government has taken to</p>
<p>address this massive corruption that plagued PNG Ports in influencing the awarding of contracts</p>
<p>to this Filipino company?</p>
<p>Mr William Duma — Point of Order! I want to point out to the good leader of the</p>
<p>Opposition that the financing package from the Australians has not reached our shores yet and</p>
<p>money has not even been utilised for the project. So there is no basis for anyone to say that</p>
<p>Australian taxpayers’ money has been misused or used in a corrupt way.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Minister, your Point of Order is in order. I will</p>
<p>ask the Opposition Leader to finish asking his question and Prime Minister can respond.</p>
<p>Mr JOSEPH LELANG - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, this happened in 2017 so I think</p>
<p>the Prime Minister is capable of clearing the air on all of these.</p>
<p>Page 19:</p>
<p>(4) And the last question, what steps are taken to deal with this Australian citizen who is</p>
<p>the ring leader and mastermind behind this massive corruption scandal and the Filipino company</p>
<p>who has bribed our PNG officials to get these particular contracts?</p>
<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE -— Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. I am happy to answer these</p>
<p>questions raised by the Opposition Leader.</p>
<p>These are important questions raised for public interest. The Australian ABC has done their</p>
<p>investigation and publication on this matter so it is important that the question is asked and</p>
<p>response is given so I appreciate the Opposition Leader for the questions and the opportunity to</p>
<p>respond,</p>
<p>13/04</p>
<p>I think he prefaced his questions by giving some background so it is only fair that from</p>
<p>what information I have I make some responses before I answer the questions that he asked.</p>
<p>Just for the record, the alleged transactions and involvement of the Australian that is named</p>
<p>on the Floor of the Parliament; the transactions took place before the arrangements with the</p>
<p>Australian Infrastructure Fund Facility that we have been running with PNG Ports.</p>
<p>This is a good program, with substantial port interventions with six major ports in our</p>
<p>country running through this facility. So the allegations that ABC News has picked up were matters</p>
<p>that took place before these port intervention arrangements took place or were agreed upon.</p>
<p>The current port facility with the Australian assistant has taken place under my</p>
<p>government’s watch but the allegations that are now spun, took place before that, I think the</p>
<p>Opposition Leader did make a mention of 2017-2018 and thereabout.</p>
<p>Just to give assurance to Parliament and to the country, I have asked the Minister for State-</p>
<p>owned Enterprise and Kumul Consolidated Holdings to give a total investigation and check on this</p>
<p>matter so that on a subsequent parliamentary sitting or through a public press release we could</p>
<p>inform the country of the total background of what happened during the 2017-2018 period. As a</p>
<p>reference to a major company that operated, that company’s engagement was secured through due</p>
<p>process in 2017-2018. That company operates Port Moresby and Lae Ports, as we speak, and to be</p>
<p>fair, that company is a Philippines company that operates Melbourne Port and some other big ports</p>
<p>in the world. It is the second biggest private port operator as we speak. © Now, whatever that</p>
<p>company did with the person named I am not privy to the full information but to be fair on PNG</p>
<p>Ports and its current Management and Board we have asked for a total look into this transaction.</p>
<p>Page 20:</p>
<p>PNG Ports, in one of my statements I have released, is one of our success stories in the</p>
<p>Kumul Group of Companies as far as Kumul Group of Companies is concerned. We are very much</p>
<p>concerned that this report has cast a black spot into PNG Ports. It has a proven success story, and</p>
<p>it sits on the entrance of trade and commerce into our country so we are very mindful of the</p>
<p>implications of this report.</p>
<p>We are doing internal investigations to ascertain if there are any acts of impropriety</p>
<p>whether by the operator or the person named in this report. Whether he plays golf with me or not</p>
<p>is secondary, I do not tolerate corruption and illegal activities.</p>
<p>I am the Patron of the Port Moresby Royal Golf Club, and I stay there to play so anyone</p>
<p>that walks into that club whether a visitor or a new person I invite them for a game or walk at the</p>
<p>Golf Course as part of my health regimes anyway.</p>
<p>So, Mr Maddison plays one or two rounds with me, the person that is named, but outside</p>
<p>of playing golf this report has cast a negative implication on PNG Ports so I have tasked the</p>
<p>Minister for State-Owned Enterprise to review what has happened and he has given his preliminary</p>
<p>observations on the transactions but the fullest review will be undertaken and reported back to the</p>
<p>Parliament.</p>
<p>I take this time also to relay to the country and all who come here to do business that you</p>
<p>are not here to break laws to do business in our country.</p>
<p>14/04</p>
<p>Today before I took this question there was a circulation in our government Whatsapp on</p>
<p>illegal shops at the ports in Lae and I have sent word to relevant authorities and if it is found to be</p>
<p>illegal they just have to de-register the company and conduct investigations. Those who are</p>
<p>entrusted with responsibilities to do this sort of things must run with it. You do not have to wait</p>
<p>for instructions from the top and it should apply to everyone who comes into this country. Whether</p>
<p>you play golf with me or associate with anyone but follow the laws and do things correctly and</p>
<p>you will enjoy your stay here. We are getting a full investigation done into this matter to check</p>
<p>what is happening. We will report back to the Parliament if I could reserve the right to report back</p>
<p>as soon as the full report of this transaction is made available to us.</p>
<p>Lole Mining Environmental Pollution Concerns</p>
<p>Mr PETER ISOAIMO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to</p>
<p>the Minister for Mining and I would appreciate if the Minister for CEPA can take note.</p>
<p>Page 21:</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, I attended to an invitation to a forum organized by the Tolokuma Mine’s</p>
<p>new owners, the Lole Mining Company, at Bluff Inn resort in Hiri-Koiari Electorate. I learnt then</p>
<p>that the company is now licensed to commence operations of the mine.</p>
<p>Whilst I do appreciate and welcome the news for the project to kick start for revenue to</p>
<p>come into the country through our annual budget process; my people of Kairuku have an issue</p>
<p>with the re-opening of the mine, especially with the dumping of the mine waste that had actually</p>
<p>happened in the last 25-30 years of mine operations to the people of Kuni, Mekeo and Kairuku</p>
<p>LLGs respectively.</p>
<p>These are people who live along the St Joseph - Angabanga River that runs from the</p>
<p>Tolokuma area in Goilala District and ends up at the Abiara/Oreke village at the Kairuku area</p>
<p>running through Kuni and Mekeo LLGs.</p>
<p>My questions to the Minister are;</p>
<p>(1) Can he deny or confirm that he did issue a mining lease to Lole Mining to re-</p>
<p>commence mining?</p>
<p>(2) Is he also going to look into the pollution issue that my people have been affected with</p>
<p>for the last 25-30 years of the mine being in operation?</p>
<p>Obviously, the current Member for Goilala will agree with me because he visited the</p>
<p>St Gerald’s School of Nursing in Veifa’a on February 10 2023 and he would agree with</p>
<p>me that the Angabanga River has sedimentation build up on the river bed that causes havoc as soon</p>
<p>as the rain falls in the mountains of Goilala and the flood runs through in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Having to run through a dry road in west Mekeo area and only in a matter of hours he had</p>
<p>to go through 2-3-metre-deep water flood, so there is a real issue here. We’ve also had deformed</p>
<p>babies and mysterious deaths.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Member, make a short statement and get straight</p>
<p>to your question.</p>
<p>Mr PETER ISOAIMO ~— All of these have been caused by the mine for almost 20-30</p>
<p>years of the mine being in operation.</p>
<p>15/04</p>
<p>With the re-opening of the mine, I would like to draw the Minister’s attention to the</p>
<p>livelihoods of these people. Otherwise, we would be causing genocide like other places in the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Page 22:</p>
<p>My question to the Minister is;</p>
<p>(3) Has the Minister renewed or issued a licence to Lole Mining to commence</p>
<p>operation in the absence of all the environmental issues that are yet to be resolved?</p>
<p>I would invite the Minister to look at some world class safety-cautious mines in the world.</p>
<p>For example; with an invitation, the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare and I visited —</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Member, you have already asked your question</p>
<p>and now you are making statements. We have limited time for questions.</p>
<p>Mr PETER ISOAIMO -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. These are matters of importance</p>
<p>and we need to get the Minister to answer correctly because it involves lives of people. The people</p>
<p>of Kairiku are people of Papua New Guinea that deserve human rights like everybody else.</p>
<p>My question is; can the Minister confirm if he has re-issued the mining licence without</p>
<p>consideration for all the environmental impacts it will cause again to my people?</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER -— Honourable Minister, you are aware that I have been</p>
<p>interrupting the Member on his statement but his concern is on the issues in his electorate. I hope</p>
<p>you will respond well to the Member.</p>
<p>Sir ANO PALA -— Mr Acting Speaker, I am aware of the importance of this question. The</p>
<p>Member for Kairiku has been a real champion of this environmental issue and he has the right to</p>
<p>be concerned and should be allowed to raise his concerns on the Floor of Parliament, especially to</p>
<p>me as the Minister for Mining.</p>
<p>This is an issue that must be addressed at all times on this Floor of Parliament.</p>
<p>Environmental issues are important because if affects the lives of people along the rivers. As the</p>
<p>Minister responsible, I was not involved in some of these arrangements, especially the mining</p>
<p>license.</p>
<p>The license for this mine was issued, but the company went into liquidation. Liquidation</p>
<p>is a commercial transaction issue, meaning when you don’t have any money, you go into</p>
<p>liquidation. You are then governed by the laws of liquidation to handle those issues. But this will</p>
<p>not affect your mining right license. That license is still there, and now that the company has found</p>
<p>a way out of the liquidation, it is now going into business. The mining licence was issued and is</p>
<p>in existence, but as a result of the problems, they couldn’t continue. I want to stress that since the</p>
<p>company was bought from the liquidators, it can now go into business.</p>
<p>Page 23:</p>
<p>I am concerned about the environmental issues that you have raised. We have to be mindful</p>
<p>of the fact that you have been raising this issue since you have been on the Floor of Parliament.</p>
<p>You have a right to do so and it is important that we address these issues.</p>
<p>I will leave that area of the aspect of mining to the responsible Minister to answer you. I</p>
<p>want to also assure you that I am very concerned about it too, since the mine is likely to be re-</p>
<p>open.</p>
<p>16/04</p>
<p>We will look at everywhere possible to minimize the impact of the waste dumping in the</p>
<p>rivers. It is something that we should not do. But because companies have been given mining</p>
<p>licenses, environmental damages are bound by those commitments. All of us are bound by it but</p>
<p>we should not stop looking at its detrimental effects. We must find a way because it not only affects</p>
<p>the environment but it also affects our marketability. It affects our value in the industry and in the</p>
<p>market place. If we are dumping out there the impact will make it difficult for us to do business.</p>
<p>This is because the rest of the world is moving forward and we have to move on as well.</p>
<p>With that, I want to assure you that we will continue to look at a better way. Regarding the</p>
<p>mining license, it was done before and I am committed to those commitments that have been made</p>
<p>by the previous ministers. It was made for companies which had now gone into commercial</p>
<p>commitments too. And as a government we have a duty to honor those commitments, but the</p>
<p>Member for Kairiku, I am with you. I am with your people and I am with your concerns and I want</p>
<p>to assure you that we are looking at every possible way of minimizing or even stopping disposal</p>
<p>of wastes in the rivers. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Members, I will recognize the Member for North</p>
<p>Fly. I think he has been standing throughout the week and I haven’t recognized him. So I now</p>
<p>recognize the Member for North Fly to ask questions.</p>
<p>Development of Border Facilities</p>
<p>Mr JAMES DONALD - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, it is very generous of you,</p>
<p>because I was sitting and did not stand up. My questions are directed to the Prime Minister. This</p>
<p>is regarding the borders of PNG and Indonesia. I realized we do not have a minister for border</p>
<p>development but it is more appropriate I ask the Prime Minister. This is in relation to the border</p>
<p>post that we are doing in Western Province. On record I think there are two border posts in Western</p>
<p>Page 24:</p>
<p>Province in Sota and Weam and one in North Fly and a proposed one in Middle Fly. Previously</p>
<p>we had the one in Wutung and I think the other two in Tumolbil and the rest in West Sepik.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
