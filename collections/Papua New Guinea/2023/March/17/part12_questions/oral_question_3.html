<p>(3) When are they going to be paid their salary increment?</p>
<p>Thank you, Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr JOE SUNGI - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and I thank the honorable Member for</p>
<p>Moresby North-East for asking a very important question regarding teachers three per cent</p>
<p>increment; CPI based on the public servants salary increase as well.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, Ill like to inform the House that teachers are part of the Public</p>
<p>Servants in the country that we have about 130,000 clocks on the payroll every fortnight. But out</p>
<p>of the 130,000 public servants, we have 65,000 teachers and therefore they are also entitled for the</p>
<p>three per cent increment.</p>
<p>However, the direct answers to the three questions are; firstly, yes, they are entitled for the</p>
<p>three per cent increment. Secondly, the Department of Personnel Management is waiting for the</p>
<p>Teachers Union or PNGTA to get themselves organized so they will sort out that matter with the</p>
<p>Teacher Service Commission.</p>
<p>09/04</p>
<p>Then from there the process comes to my Department and Treasury or Finance will be able</p>
<p>to release the funding to pay the 3 per cent to them. It’s just the timing that there’s a bit of issue</p>
<p>with the union or PNGTA to get themselves organized and come forward with TSC and my</p>
<p>department and the Department of Personnel Management. We do the paper work to assist them</p>
<p>and make sure that the 3 per cent is also awarded and paid in CPI increase to teachers across Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea</p>

<p>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Chimbu — Build Polytechnic School</p>
<p>Mr LUCAS DAWA DEKENA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, thank you for giving me</p>
<p>this opportunity to ask my question for the first time during this term of Parliament. Before I ask</p>
<p>my question to the Higher Education Minister and for the Education Minister to take note, I would</p>
<p>like to thank the people of Gumine for giving me the mandate on four consecutive elections. I</p>
<p>served the first time I stood for the elections then after that I was taken to Court. in 2017. I was</p>
<p>taken to Court and then in the last elections I was voted in again by the Gumine people therefore I</p>
<p>am thankful to them for giving me the mandate to speak on their behalf here in Parliament.</p>
<p>In 2014 there was an NEC Decision relating to the setting up of Polytechs around the</p>
<p>country. The NEC Decision 105 of 2014 stated that there would be three Polytechs around the</p>
<p>country, and one of them would be set up in Chimbu province. Since then nothing has been nothing</p>
<p>has been built in my electorate. The Deputy Prime Minister whilst he was Acting Prime Minister</p>
<p>visited a site for another project. During his visit he asked me where the Simbu Polytech was and</p>
<p>I pointed to a grassland with nothing but fencing</p>
<p>Therefore, my question is to the Higher Education Minister but I would like the Education</p>
<p>Minister to take note because the responsibility was switched between these two ministries. Now</p>
<p>I believe Polytech comes under the Higher Education Minister. I’m not sure what has happened to</p>
<p>the Polytechs in other provinces if they have been constructed and students have started school but</p>
<p>as for Gumine nothing has been done yet, apart from the wire fencing. We believe that there was</p>
<p>a substantial amount of money that was released for this project and there is a certain NPC Limited</p>
<p>joint venture with TP Solutions where TP Solutions may have given the contract to NPC to start</p>
<p>of the constructions.</p>
